PART I

ITEM 1. Business

Overview

We design and sell products and services that together provide our customers with
purpose-built, high performance Internet Protocol (“IP”) platforms that enable them to support a
wide variety of services and applications at scale. Our customers include service providers,
enterprises, governments and research and education institutions, who rely on us to deliver a
portfolio of proven networking, security and application acceleration solutions that solve highly
complex, fast-changing problems in the world’s most demanding networks.

In 2006 we invested in our internal research and product innovation both for release in the
year and for future release. We made several significant new product and strategy announcements in
2006 for both our service provider and our enterprise customers.

In 2005, we completed the following five acquisitions: Kagoor Networks, Inc. (“Kagoor”),
Redline Networks, Inc (“Redline”), Peribit Networks, Inc. (“Peribit”), Acorn Packet Solutions, Inc.
(“Acorn”), and Funk Software, Inc. (“Funk”). In 2004, we completed the acquisition of NetScreen
Technologies, Inc. (“NetScreen”). These acquisitions expanded our customer base and product
portfolio.

We continued to define our portfolio of products into the following two categories of
networking products:

§

Infrastructure products, which consist predominately of our router portfolio, and the
acquired Kagoor and Acorn products.

§

Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”) products, which consist predominately of the
former NetScreen, Peribit, Redline and Funk products.

Our operations are organized into three operating segments: Infrastructure, SLT, and Service.
Our Infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable router products that are used to control and
direct network traffic from the core, through the edge, aggregation and the customer premise
equipment level. Our SLT segment offers solutions that meet a broad array of our customer’s
priorities, from protecting the network itself, and protecting data on the network, to maximizing
existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications across a distributed network. Together, our
high performance secure networking solutions help enable our customers to convert networks that
provide commoditized, best efforts services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation
and value and increased reliability and security to end users. Our Service segment delivers
world-wide services to customers of the Infrastructure and SLT segments.

During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 we generated net revenues of $2.3 billion and
conducted business in nearly 100 countries. See the information in Item 8 for more information on
our consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and our consolidated results
of operations, consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity, and consolidated statements of cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006.

We were incorporated in California in 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998. Our
corporate headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California. Our website address is www.juniper.net.

Our Strategy

Our objective and strategy is to provide best-in-class traffic processing technologies that
allow our customers to provide a secure and reliable, high performance network experience for any
application on an IP network. Our technological leadership and complex problem solving abilities
combined with our experience and fundamental understanding of the requirements of high performance
IP secure networking solutions will help us in meeting our objectives. Key elements of our strategy
are described below.

Maintain and Extend Technology Leadership

.

Our application-specific integrated circuit
(“ASIC”) technology, operating system and network-optimized product architecture have been key
elements to establishing our technology leadership. We believe that these elements can be leveraged
into future products that we are currently developing. We intend to maintain and extend our
technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise markets primarily through
innovation and continued investment in our research and development departments, supplemented by
external partnerships, including strategic alliances, as well as acquisitions that would allow us
to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets.



Leverage Position as Supplier of Purpose-Built Network Infrastructure and Security

.

From
inception we have focused on designing and building IP network infrastructure for service providers
and network intensive businesses and have integrated purpose-built technology into a network
optimized architecture that specifically meets our customers’ needs. We believe that many of these
customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors. We believe that the
purpose-built nature of our products provide us with a competitive advantage, which is critical in
gaining selection as one of these vendors.

Be Strategic to Our Customers

.

In developing our infrastructure and SLT solutions, we work
very closely with customers to design and build a product specifically to meet their complex needs.
Over time, we have expanded our understanding of the challenges facing these customers. That
increased understanding has enabled us to subsequently design additional capabilities into our
products. We believe our close relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers have
been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date. We plan to continue to work very
closely with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as to design future products
that meet their evolving needs.

Enable New IP-Based Services

.

Our platforms enable network operators to build and secure
networks cost-effectively and to offer new differentiated services for their customers more
efficiently than legacy network products. We believe that the secure delivery of IP-based services
and applications, including Internet Protocol Television (“IPTV”), web hosting, outsourced Internet
and intranet services, outsourced enterprise applications and voice-over IP, will continue to grow
and are cost-effectively enabled by our secure networking solutions.

Establish and Develop Industry Partnerships

.

Our customers have diverse requirements. While
our products meet certain requirements of our customers, our products are not intended to satisfy
certain other requirements. Therefore, we believe that it is important that we build relationships
with other industry leaders in a diverse set of networking technologies and services. These
relationships ensure that we have access to those technologies and services, whether through
technology integration, joint development, resale or other collaboration, in order to better
support a broader set of our customers’ requirements.

Markets and Customers

We sell our products and services through direct sales and through distributors and
value-added resellers to end-users in the following markets:

Service Providers

Service providers include wireline, wireless, and cable operators as well as major internet
content providers. Supporting most major service provider networks in the world, our platforms are
designed and built for the scale and dependability that service providers demand. Our secure
networking solutions benefit these customers by:

§

Reducing capital and operational costs by running multiple services over the same
network using our high density, highly reliable platforms;

§

Promoting generation of additional revenue by enabling new services to be offered to new
market segments based on our product capabilities;

§

Increasing customer satisfaction, while lowering costs, by enabling consumers to
self-select automatically provisioned service packages that provide the quality, speed and
pricing they desire; and

§

Providing increased asset longevity and higher return on investment as their networks
can scale to multi-terabit rates based on the capabilities of our platforms.

While many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as
wireless, wireline, or cable operators, in 2006 we saw a move towards convergence of these
different types of service providers through acquisition, merger and partnerships. We believe these
strategic developments are made technically possible as operators invest in next generation
networks (“NGN”) capable of supporting voice, video and data traffic on to the same IP-based
network. This convergence relies on IP-based traffic processing and creates the opportunity for
multi-service networks including new service offerings such as IPTV. These new services offer
service providers significant new revenue opportunities.

We believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are
well positioned to deliver products and solutions. These trends include significant growth in IP
traffic on service provider networks as a result of peer-to-peer interaction,



broadband usage, video, and an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical
business tool in the strategies of our IP customers, and of their enterprise customers.

The IP infrastructure market for service providers includes: products and technology at the
network core; the network edge to enable access; the aggregation layer; security to protect from
the inside out and the outside in; the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the
network to meet business and user needs; and the management and control of the entire
infrastructure.

Our products are present in all of the 30 largest service provider networks in the world.

Enterprise

Our high performance secure networking solutions are designed to meet the reliability and
scalability demanded by the world’s most advanced networks. For this reason, network intensive
enterprises, federal, state and local governments, and research and education institutions that
rely on their networks for the operation of their business are able to deploy our solutions as a
powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leading-edge
applications while:

§

Reducing costs through operational efficiencies in implementing and managing the network;

§

Driving down capital expenses with sophisticated network intelligence that is robust, secure, and scalable;

§

Providing enterprises with the control necessary to deliver a secure and reliable user
experience to their customers and internal clients; and

§

Working as a business partner for the long term with the optimal combination of
flexibility, responsiveness, technical know-how and financial strength.

The enterprise market continues to be an important part of our business growth during 2006
driven in particular by growth in the second half of the year. Since we first entered the market,
we have sold our products to over 20,000 enterprise customers and as of December 31, 2006 we had
more than 9,000 channel partners.

As with the service provider market, innovation continues to be a critical component in our
strategy for the enterprise market. We believe there is a growing need for enterprises to build
advanced networks with real time information and reliable network performance. These enterprises
need high performing, scalable and secure networks that are global, distributed and always
available. Network equipment vendors need to demonstrate high performance and high security to
these customers in specific segments with best-in-class open solutions for maximum flexibility. We
offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers, branch and campus applications,
distributed and extended enterprises, and Wide Area Network (“WAN”) gateways.

We believe that the market is moving toward high performance, integrated solutions to drive
increased operational efficiencies. This is partly illustrated by the success of our Integrated
Security Gateway (“ISG”) products that combine firewall/virtual private network (“VPN”) and
intrusion detection and prevention (“IDP”) solutions in a single platform and Secure Services
Gateway (“SSG”) platforms that provide a mix of high performance security with Local Area Network
(“LAN”)/WAN connectivity for regional and branch office deployments. We will continue to invest to
develop these and other converged technologies and solutions.

Fundamental Requirements for High Performance Secure Networks

As they work to support growth in IP traffic and seek to offer new revenue-generating or
mission-critical services, our customers require secure network solutions that are not only feature
rich but also deliver high reliability, high performance and assured user experiences.

At the same time, both service providers and enterprises must focus on detecting and
preventing the ever increasing number of security threats facing the network itself and the data
that flows across the network. This security must be innate to networking products and must not
come at the expense of overall performance or unjustifiable cost.

Feature richness, high reliability, security, high performance, scalability, and cost
effectiveness are each fundamental requirements in meeting the needs associated with the growth in
IP traffic and the delivery of value-added services to end users.



Feature Richness.

The importance of increasing revenue streams and decreasing capital and
operational costs for our customers is a significant priority in the industry. Service providers
want to sell more revenue generating services with better cost efficiencies. Enterprises and other
network operators want to provide a network experience to their end users on a cost effective but
value-generating basis. Each of these goals is ultimately a function of the features and
capabilities that can be securely provided on each of the network elements. As networks advance,
more and more features are required to sell new services as well as to lower the ongoing costs of
operating the network. Next generation networking solutions therefore need to have flexibility to
add new capabilities frequently without compromising the performance of the system, which gets
increasingly difficult as the network demands increase.

High Reliability

.

As businesses and consumers increasingly rely on IP networks for
mission-critical applications, high network reliability is essential. As a result, those businesses
and consumers expect service providers to deliver a high degree of reliability in their networks.

Security

.

Today’s network environment presents an ever-increasing number of challenges
regarding network security ranging from simple denial of service attacks to sophisticated,
pervasive and malicious intrusions. The importance of security is increasing within all of our
customers and we are continually improving and evolving the security capabilities on all of our
product solutions. It is extremely important to provide comprehensive network-based security
services that are fully integrated, free of performance trade-offs, and scaleable to any customer
or market.

High Performance Without Compromising Intelligence

.

To handle the rapid growth in IP traffic,
today’s network operators increasingly require secure networking solutions that can operate at
higher speeds, while still delivering real-time services such as security and quality-of-service
features. The processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated forwarding
technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination based on priority, data type and
other considerations. Because a large number of IP packets, many of which perform critical
administrative functions, are small in size, high performance IP routers need to achieve their
specified transmission speeds even for small packet sizes. Because smaller packets increase packet
processing demands, routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be more resource intensive
than routing of larger packets. A wire speed router, which achieves its specified transmission rate
for any type of traffic passing through it, can accomplish this task. Thus, provisioning of
mission-critical services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed
processing.

High Performance Under Stressful Conditions

.

In a large and complex network, individual
components inevitably fail. However, the failure of an individual device or link must not
compromise the network as a whole. In a typical network, when a failure occurs, the network loses
some degree of capacity and, in turn, a greater load falls on the remaining network routers, which
must provide alternate routes. IP infrastructure must quickly adjust to the new state of the
network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping significant numbers of packets when
active routes are lost or when large numbers of routes change. Routing protocols are used to
accomplish this convergence, a process that places even greater stress on the router. Given the
complexity of IP network infrastructure, the convergence process is complex and places a far
greater load on the router, thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device.

Scalability

.

Due to the rapid growth in IP traffic, service providers must continuously expand
their networks, both in terms of increased numbers of access points of presence (“PoPs”), and also
greater capacity per PoP. To facilitate this expansion process, secure networking solutions must be
highly scalable. Next generation network appliances therefore need to be flexible and configurable
to function within constantly changing networks while incurring minimal downtime.

High Return on Investment

.

Continued growth in IP traffic, price competition in the
telecommunications market and increasing pressure for network operators to attain higher returns on
their network infrastructure investments all contribute to our customers’ desire for solutions that
significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build and operate their networks. In
addition to the basic cost of equipment, network operators incur substantial ancillary costs for
the space required to deploy the equipment, power consumed and ongoing operation and maintenance of
the equipment. Network operators therefore want to deploy dense and varied equipment configurations
in limited amounts of rack and floor space. Therefore, in order to continue to scale their networks
toward higher data speeds in a cost effective manner, network operators need the ability to mix and
match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities, without significantly
increasing the consumption of space or power and driving costs higher.

These requirements define a clear need for IP infrastructure and security solutions that can
support high speeds and offer new IP-based services. At the same time, network operators are
eagerly seeking new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within their
networks and reduce the cost of their architectures.



Our Technology and Products

Early in our history, we developed, marketed and sold the first commercially available
purpose-built IP backbone router optimized for the specific high performance needs of service
providers. As the need for core bandwidth continued to increase, the need for service rich
platforms at the edge of the network was created. Our infrastructure products are designed to
address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless access by
combining high-performance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a
network-optimized solution. In addition, as enterprises continue to develop and rely upon more
sophisticated and pervasive internal networks, we believe the need for products with
high-performance routing technology is expanding to a broader set of customers, and we believe our
expertise in this technology positions us to address this growing market opportunity.

We offer a broad family of network security solutions that deliver high performance,
cost-effective security for enterprises, service providers and government entities, including
firewall and VPN systems and appliances, secure sockets layer (“SSL”) VPN appliances, and IDP
appliances. With the acquisitions of Funk, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor, we added complementary
products and technologies to our SLT product family that enable our customers to provide additional
IP-based services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and
applications.

Infrastructure Products

We believe that an overview of the physical nature of our infrastructure products is helpful
in understanding the operation of our business.

Although specific designs vary among our product families, our platforms are essentially
modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. The chassis contains components that
enable and support many of the fundamental functions of the router, such as power supplies, cooling
fans, and components that run our JUNOS or JUNOSe operating system, perform high-speed packet
forwarding, or keep track of the structure of the network and instruct the packet forwarding
components where to send packets. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to
be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces.

The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from
the network over a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission
medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely
depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. In some cases, modules do not
contain ports or physically receive packets from the network, but rather enhance the overall
functionality of the router. We refer to these components as service modules.

Major infrastructure product families are summarized as follows:

§

M-Series and T-Series:

Our M-series platforms are extremely versatile as they can be
deployed at the edge of operator networks, in small and medium core networks, enterprise
networks and in other applications. The M-series product family includes the M320, M160,
M120, M40e, M20, M10i and M7i platforms. The MX-Series is a new product family developed as
a platform to address the Carrier Ethernet market and the MX960 is the first in a series of
platforms designed for emerging Ethernet network architectures and services. Our T-series
platforms, T640, T320, and TX Matrix, are primarily designed for core IP infrastructures.
The M-series and T-series products leverage our ASIC technology and the same JUNOS operating
system to enable consistent, continuous, reliable and predictable service delivery.

§

E-Series:

Our E-series products are a full featured platform with support for
carrier-class routing, broadband subscriber management services and a comprehensive set of
IP services. The E-series family includes the ERX-1440, -1410, -710, -705 and -310 platforms
and the E320 platform. Leveraging our JUNOSe operating system, the E-Series service delivery
architecture enables service providers to easily deploy innovative revenue generating
services to their customers and avoid the costly and limiting piecemeal outcomes that result
from equipment that delivers inconsistent edge services. All E-Series platforms offer a full
suite of routing protocols and provide scalable capacity for tens of thousands of users.

SLT Products

SLT products provide network security solutions and enable our customers to provide additional
IP-based services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and
applications.

Major SLT product families are summarized as follows:

§

Firewall and VPN Systems:

Our NS-5400, -5200, and -500 products and ISG-2000 and -1000
products are high performance security systems designed to provide integrated firewall, VPN
and denial of service protection capabilities for enterprise



environments and carrier network infrastructures. Our ISG-2000 and -1000 products can also
deliver intrusion detection and prevention functionality with the addition of optional
security modules to the base ISG chassis. Each of our firewall and VPN systems can be
deployed in high bandwidth environments and can be used to deliver managed security services.
Our firewall and VPN systems allow unique security policies to be enforced for multiple
virtual local area networks, or Virtual LANs (“VLANs”), allowing a single system to secure
multiple networks. Our security systems also allow for the creation of multiple Virtual
Systems, each providing a unique security domain with its own virtual firewall and VPN and
dedicated management interface. These features enable enterprises, service providers and
government entities to use a single security system to secure multiple networks and enable
carriers to deliver security services to multiple customers.

In 2006, we announced several significant new products for both of our Infrastructure and SLT
products including, but not limited to, the following:

Infrastructure:

§

The MX960 Ethernet Services Router, a high-density, purpose-built, platform designed to
address the “Carrier Ethernet” market. The MX960 is the first in a series of platforms
designed for emerging Ethernet network architectures and services, and complements many
products and technologies introduced by us in 2006. We expect to begin shipment of the
MX960 in the first quarter of 2007.

§

A series of enhancements for the E320 broadband services router. These enhancements
include the delivery of new interface cards with advanced capabilities designed to reduce
the complexity of deploying Internet Protocol Television (“IPTV”) and other services.

§

The new M120 platform which is our next generation multi-service edge and small core
routing platform.

§

A new T-series 40 Gbps interface card was also released which delivers enhanced
interoperability and service agility over optical transport and IP network infrastructures.



SLT:

§

The SSG family of branch office security products. The new SSG products combine
firewall, virtual private network (“VPN”) and routing functionality with UTM security
features to protect traffic as it flows in and out of the enterprise branch offices.

§

Our branch office strategy, which leverages our standards-based application
acceleration, IP telephony, routing and security products. This includes a full branch
solution using our SSG security platforms and new J4350 and J6350 J-series enterprise
routers. The strategy also includes a range of new implementation services and the
integration of Intelligent Communications capabilities from Avaya, offering customers
increased choice and flexibility for branch offices.

§

The completion of integration of our 802.1X components with our new UAC 2.0 solution,
including elements of our Odyssey Access Client and Steel-Belted Radius products. As an
open standards-access control solution, UAC 2.0 can be deployed in a flexible array of
deployment scenarios to give enterprises real-time visibility and granular policy control
throughout the network.

§

New additions to our WX and DX application acceleration platforms, which advance
performance and availability and management of our comprehensive data center solution and
are designed to meet the changing requirements for enterprise data centers.

See Note 12 in Item 8 for a breakdown of net product revenues by segment.

Customer Service and Support

In addition to infrastructure products and SLT products, we offer the following services:
24x7x365 technical assistance, hardware repair and replacement parts, unspecified software updates
on a when and if available basis, professional services and educational services. We deliver these
services directly to major end users and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the
capabilities of our partners and third party organizations as appropriate.

We also train our channel partners in the delivery of education and support services to ensure
locally delivered training.

As of December 31, 2006, we employed 611 people in our worldwide customer service and support
organization. We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful
customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with
proven network experience to provide those services.

Sales and Marketing

As of December 31, 2006, we employed 1,591 people in our worldwide sales and marketing
organizations. These sales employees operate in different locations around the world in support of
our customers.

Our sales organization is organized into three geographic theaters and within each theater
according to the particular needs in that market. Our three geographic theaters are (i) the
Americas (including United States, Canada, Central and South America), (ii) Europe, Middle East and
Africa and (iii) Asia Pacific. Within each theater there are regional and country teams to ensure
we operate close to the customer.

The sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers
directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or
channels as described below. In the United States and Canada, we sell to several service providers
directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through resellers.
Almost all of our sales outside the United States and Canada are made through channel partners.

See Note 12 in Item 8 for information concerning our revenues by significant customers and by
geographic region.



Direct Sales Structure

Where we have a direct relationship with our customers the terms and conditions are governed
either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgement of those orders, or by purchase
contracts. In instances where we have direct contracts with our customer, those contracts set forth
only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our
products. For this type of customer our sales team engages directly with the customer. Customer
purchase orders are received, and processed directly, by Juniper Networks.

Channel Sales Structure

A critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through whom we do
the majority of our business. We employ various channel partners:

§

A global network of strategic distribution relationships, as well as theater or
country-specific distributors who in turn sell to local value added resellers who sell to
the end-user customer. The distribution channel partners mainly sell our SLT products plus
some router products that are often purchased by our enterprise customers. These
distributors tend to be focused on particular theaters or particular countries within
theaters. For example, we have substantial distribution relationships with Ingram Micro in
the Americas and with NEC in Japan. Our agreements with these distributors are generally
non-exclusive, limited by theater, and provide product discounts and other ordinary terms
of sale. These agreements do not require our distributors to purchase specified quantities
of our products.

§

Direct value-added resellers including our strategic resellers referenced below, which
resell our products to end-users around the world. These direct value-added resellers buy
the products and services directly from us and have expertise in deploying complex
networking solutions in their respective markets. Our agreements with these direct
value-added resellers are generally non-exclusive, limited by theater, and provide product
discounts and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not require our direct
value-added resellers to purchase specified quantities of our products.

§

Strategic world-wide reseller relationships with Siemens AG, Ericsson Telekom A.B. and
Alcatel-Lucent. These companies each offer services and products that complement, but in
some cases compete with, our own product offerings and act as a fulfillment partner for our
products. Our arrangements with each of these partners allow them to resell our products on
a worldwide, non-exclusive basis, provide for discounts based upon the volume of products
sold and specify other general terms of sale. The agreements do not require these partners
to purchase specified quantities of our products. Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of
our total net revenues in 2006.

Within each theater we employ sales professionals to assist with the management of our various
sales channels. In addition we have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly with the
channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a direct relationship with our more strategic
end user customers while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of product through
our channel partners.

Our sales team is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers, with each
separate team ensuring focus on the key customers in these respective markets. There is a structure
of sales professionals, system engineers, marketing and channel teams each focused on the
respective service provider and enterprise markets.

Research and Development

As of December 31, 2006, we employed 2,070 people in our worldwide research and development
organization. We have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields
of high-end computing, network system design, security, routing protocols and embedded operating
systems. These individuals have worked in leading computer data networking and telecommunications
companies. In addition to building complex hardware and operating systems, the engineering team has
experience in delivering highly integrated ASICs and scalable technology.

We believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of
enhancing our core technology, developing additional applications, incorporating that technology
and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings. In our infrastructure and
SLT products, we are leveraging our ASIC technology, developing additional network interfaces
targeted to our customer applications and continuing to develop next generation technology to
support the anticipated growth in IP network requirements. We continue to expand the functionality
of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability, and to provide an enhanced user
interface.



Our research and development process is driven by the availability of new technology, market
demand and customer feedback. We have invested significant time and resources in creating a
structured process for all product development projects. This process involves all functional
groups and all levels. Following an assessment of market demand, our research and development team
develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the
product management and sales organizations. This process is designed to provide a framework for
defining and addressing the steps, tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and
development projects to market.

Manufacturing and Operations

As of December 31, 2006, we employed 149 people in manufacturing and operations who primarily
manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor and
manage product testing and quality.

We have historically had manufacturing relationships primarily with Celestica and Plexus,
under which we have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity. During 2006 we made a
strategic decision to expand our manufacturing capabilities into China to supplement our existing
manufacturing in the United States and Canada. As a result, we expanded our relationship with
Celestica in China, and added Flextronics as an additional contract manufacturer in China.

This subcontracting activity in all locations extends from prototypes to full production and
includes activities such as material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to our
customers and repairs. Together with our contract manufacturers, we design, specify, and monitor
the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards. These arrangements
provide us with the following benefits:

Our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on rolling forecasts from us about
our product demands. Each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble
the products in our forecast and test the products according to our specifications. Products are
then shipped directly to our distributors, value-added resellers or end-users. We generally do not
own the components, and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and
immediately to our customers upon shipment. In certain circumstances, we may be liable to our
contract manufacturers for carrying and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased
based on our forecasts.

Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers, those contracts merely set forth a
framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us. The contracts
do not require them to manufacture our products on a long-term basis.

Our ASICs are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources, such as IBM Corporation and
Toshiba Corporation, each of whom is responsible for all aspects of the production of the ASICs
using our proprietary designs.

We have at our core five key values: trust, integrity, respect, humility and excellence. These
values are integral to how we manage our company and interact with our employees, customers,
partners and suppliers. By working collaboratively with our suppliers, we also have the opportunity
to promote socially responsible business practices beyond Juniper Networks and into our worldwide
supply chain. To this end, we have adopted, and promote the adoption by others, of the Electronic
Industry Code of Conduct. The Electronic Industry Code of Conduct outlines standards to ensure that
working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with
respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.



Backlog

Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products or
services or purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers. At any given time, we
have orders for products that have not been shipped and for services that have not yet been
performed for various reasons. Because of industry practice that allows customers to cancel or
change orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment or performance, as well as our own
history of allowing such changes and cancellations, we do not consider this backlog to be firm.

Competition

Competition in the markets for our infrastructure and SLT products is intense.

Infrastructure Business.

In the network infrastructure business, Cisco Systems has
historically been the dominant player in the market. However, other companies such as
Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., and Nortel Networks Corporation, are
providing competitive products in the marketplace.

Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and
Nortel have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their products with other
networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In
addition, consolidation among competitors, or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by
competitors, can increase the competitive pressure faced by us. For example, in 2006 Alcatel
combined with Lucent Technologies, Inc. and Ericsson acquired Redback Networks. Also, many of our
current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases
that could be leveraged. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer
orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could seriously harm our
operating results.

Several companies also provide solutions that can substitute for some uses of routers. For
example, high bandwidth Asynchronous Transfer Mode (“ATM”) switches are used in the core of certain
major backbone service providers. ATM switches can carry a variety of traffic types, including
voice, video and data, using fixed, 53 byte cells. Companies that use ATM switches are enhancing
their products with new software technologies such as Multi-Protocol Label Switching (“MPLS”),
which can potentially simplify the task of mixing routers and switches in the same network. These
substitutes can reduce the need for large numbers of routers.

SLT Business.

In the market for SLT products, Cisco generally is our strongest competitor with
its broad range of products. In addition, there are a number of other competitors for each of the
product lines within SLT, including Checkpoint Software Technologies, Fortinet, Inc., F5 Networks,
Inc., Nortel and Riverbed Technology, Inc. These additional competitors tend to be focused on
single product line solutions and therefore are generally specialized and focused as competitors to
our products. In addition, a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new
products to address the same needs that our products address. We believe that our ability to
compete with Cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are
superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers.

For both product groups we expect that, over time, large companies with significant resources,
technical expertise, market experience, customer relationships and broad product lines, such as
Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and Nortel, will introduce new products which are designed to compete
more effectively in the market. There are also several other companies that claim to have products
with greater capabilities than our products. Consolidation in this industry has begun, with one or
more of these companies being acquired by large, established suppliers of network infrastructure
products, and we believe it is likely to continue.

As a result, we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with
significantly more resources than we have. Although we believe that our technology and the
purpose-built features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively
with these companies, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed
technology and know-how. Our engineering teams have significant expertise in ASIC design and we own
all rights to the design of the ASICs, which form the core of many of our products. Our operating
systems were developed internally and are protected by United States and other copyright laws.

While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology,
we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new
product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product



maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.
There can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to
our technology.

In addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From
time to time, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new
products or product enhancements. There can be no assurance that third-party licenses will be
available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability to
maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain
third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to
obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of
which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and
protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the
patent applications that we have filed, or that we will be able to obtain the necessary
intellectual property rights or those other parties will not contest our intellectual property
rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had 4,833 full-time employees, 412 of whom were in general and
administrative functions. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations
with our employees to be good. Competition for personnel in our industry is intense. We believe
that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain
qualified personnel. We believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but
there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future.

Our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key
technical, sales and senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement
requiring service for any defined period of time. The loss of the services of one or more of our
key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, train and
retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel
is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

Factors That May Affect Future Results

Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies involve significant risks. The
market price of our stock reflects a higher multiple of expected future earnings than many other
companies. Accordingly, even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and
earnings, whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results, changes in the
mix of the products and services sold, acquisitions, industry changes or other factors, could
trigger significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. Investors in our
securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors, including, but not limited to,
the following factors, that could affect our stock price.

Matters related to the investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and the
restatement of our financial statements may result in additional litigation, regulatory
proceedings and government enforcement actions.

Our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements
have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government
enforcement actions. For more information regarding our current litigation and related inquiries,
please see Part I, Item 3- “Legal Proceedings” as well as the other risk factors related to
litigation set forth in this section. We have provided the results of our internal review and
independent investigation to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the United States
Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, and in that regard we have responded to
formal and informal requests for documents and additional information. We intend to continue to
cooperate with these governmental agencies. No assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from
litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions relating to our past stock
option practices. The resolution of these matters will be time consuming, expensive, and may
distract management from the conduct of our business. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse
findings in litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions, we could be
required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed, which could harm our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, while we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in determining the
correct measurement dates for our stock option grants, the SEC may disagree with the manner in
which we accounted for and reported, or not reported, the corresponding financial impact.
Accordingly, there is a risk that we may have to further restate our prior financial statements,
amend prior filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently contemplated.

Also, in August 2006, we received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter stating that, as a
result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,
2006 (the “Second Quarter Form 10-Q”), we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for
continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and were therefore subject to
delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In November 2006, we received an additional letter
from NASDAQ of similar substance related to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006
(the “Third Quarter Form 10-Q”). In December 2006, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel granted
our request for continued listing, provided that we file a written summary of our audit committee’s
findings with NASDAQ as well as the Second Quarter Form 10-Q, the Third Quarter Form 10-Q and any
required restatements with the SEC on or before February 12, 2007. In January, we received a notice
from the NASDAQ Listing and Hearings Review Council which advised us that any delisting
determination by the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel has been stayed pending further review by
the Review Council. We have been given until March 30, 2007 to submit additional information to
assist the Review Council in their assessment of our listing status. On February 20, 2007, we filed
a written summary of our audit committee’s findings with NASDAQ. In addition, on March 9, 2007, we
filed the Second Quarter Form 10-Q and the Third Quarter Form 10-Q with the SEC. We consider that
the filing of these materials has remedied our non-compliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14),
subject to NASDAQ’s affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to us
accordingly. However, if NASDAQ disagrees with our position or if the SEC disagrees with the manner
in which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact of past stock
option grants, there could be further delays in filing subsequent SEC reports or other actions that
might result in delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and
a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results.

Our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products
in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties and
constrained spending on network expansion have previously resulted (for example, in 2001 and 2002),
and may in the future result, in decreased revenues and earnings and could negatively impact our
ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer relationships. Economic downturns may also
lead to restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments. In
addition, our operating expenses are largely based on



anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are, and will continue to be,
fixed in the short-term. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to
forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Future economic
weakness, customer financial difficulties and reductions in spending on network expansion could
have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our results of
operations and stock price.

Our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and, as
a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could
adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a
number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock
price to fluctuate.

The factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include, but are not
limited to, limited visibility into customer spending plans, changes in the mix of products sold,
changing market conditions, including current and potential customer consolidation, competition,
customer concentration, long sales and implementation cycles, regional economic and political
conditions and seasonality. For example, many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal
fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the first and third quarters.

As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating results are not
necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be. It is likely that in some
future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or
investors, in which case the price of our common stock may decline. Such a decline could occur, and
has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenue and/or earnings
guidance.

We sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and IP infrastructure
and, if the demand for network and IP systems does not continue to grow, then our business,
operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.

A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth of secure IP
infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued
growth of IP services. As a result of changes in the economy and capital spending or the building
of network capacity in excess of demand, all of which have in the past particularly affected
telecommunications service providers, spending on IP infrastructure can vary, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, a number of our
existing customers are evaluating the build out of their next generation network, or NGN. During
the decision making period when the customers are determining the design of those networks and the
selection of the equipment they will use in those networks, such customers may greatly reduce or
suspend their spending on secure IP infrastructure. Such pauses in purchases can make it more
difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending
by these customers and, even where our products are ultimately selected, can have a material
adverse effect on our business and financial results.

A limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease
in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating
results.

A substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers
and distribution partners. Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during the
years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly
fluctuations in our revenues and operating results. Any downturn in the business of our key
customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers, which
could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations. In addition, there has been and
continues to be consolidation in the telecommunications industry (for example, the acquisitions of
AT&T Inc., MCI, Inc. and BellSouth Corporation) and consolidation among the large vendors of
telecommunications equipment and services (for example, the combination of Alcatel and Lucent and
the acquisition of Redback by Ericsson). Such consolidation may cause our customers who are
involved in these acquisitions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or
have other unforeseen consequences that could harm our business and operating results.

We rely on value-added resellers and distribution partners to sell our products, and disruptions
to, or our failure to effectively develop and manage, our distribution channel and the processes
and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the
sale of our products.

Our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful
relationships with a variety of value-added reseller and distribution partners. The majority of our
revenues are derived through value-added resellers and distributors, most of which also sell
competitors’ products. Our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners. The loss
of or reduction in



sales to our value-added resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues.
During 2006, Alcatel, another value-added reseller and a competitor of ours, acquired Lucent, one
of our largest value-added resellers. In addition, our largest customer, Siemens, has announced
that it will be transferring its telecommunications business to a joint venture between Siemens and
Nokia. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in providing incentives to current or
potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our
products. If we fail to maintain relationships with our partners, fail to develop new relationships
with value-added resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of distributors and
resellers in existing markets, fail to manage, train or motivate existing value-added resellers and
distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of
our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer.

In addition, we recognize a portion of our revenue based on a sell-through model using
information provided by our distributors. If those distributors provide us with inaccurate or
untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted.

Further, in order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must continue to scale
and improve our processes and procedures that support it, and those processes and procedures may
become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage. Our failure to successfully manage
and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could
adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products.

Traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies generally require more onerous
terms and conditions of their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to such customers, we may
be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or
ability to recognize revenues.

Traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies, because of their size,
generally have had greater purchasing power and, accordingly, have requested and received more
favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors. As
we seek to sell more products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree to such terms
and conditions, which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue
and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

For example, many customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who
promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality and/or had products that
caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers. As a result, this class of
customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to
deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be
caused by our products. These additional requests and penalties, if we are required to agree to
them, would affect our ability to recognize the revenues from such sales, which may negatively
affect our business and our financial condition. For example, in April 2006, we announced that we
would be required to defer a large amount of revenue from a customer due to the contractual
obligations required by that customer.

For arrangements with multiple elements, vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is
required in order to separate the components and to account for elements of the arrangement
separately. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the
element is sold separately. However, customers may require terms and conditions that make it more
difficult or impossible for us to maintain vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the
undelivered elements to a similar group of customers, the result of which could cause us to defer
the entire arrangement fees for a similar group of customers (product, maintenance, professional
services, etc.) and recognize revenue only when the last element is delivered or if the only
undelivered element is maintenance revenue would be recognized ratably over the contractual
maintenance period which is generally one year.

We face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial
results.

Competition is intense in the markets that we address. The IP infrastructure market has
historically been dominated by Cisco with other companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Huawei,
and Nortel providing products to a smaller segment of the market. In addition, a number of other
small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to
address the same challenges that our products address.

In the service layer technologies market, we face intense competition from a broader group of
companies including appliance vendors such as Cisco, Fortinet, F5 Networks, Nortel and Riverbed,
and software vendors such as CheckPoint. In addition, a number of other small public and private
companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges
that our products address.



In addition, actual or speculated consolidation among competitors, or the acquisition of our
partners and resellers by competitors, can increase the competitive pressures faced by us. In this
regard, Alcatel has recently combined with Lucent and Ericsson has recently acquired Redback. A
number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of
products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do. If we are unable to
compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or
price, we could experience a loss in market share and revenues and/or be required to reduce prices,
which could reduce our gross margins, and which could materially and adversely affect our business,
operating results and financial condition.

If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements
that meet those needs, or if those products do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to
compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to
develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner.
If we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements
to meet those needs, such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our
present and future products, which would significantly harm our business and financial results.
Even if we are able to anticipate, develop and commercially introduce new products and
enhancements, there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread
market acceptance. Any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect
our business and financial results.

We are a party to lawsuits, which are costly to investigate and defend and, if determined
adversely to us, could require us to pay damages, any or all of which could harm our business and
financial condition.

We and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board
of directors are subject to various lawsuits. For example, the SEC and U.S. Attorney’s office have
inquired regarding our stock option pricing practices, and we have been served with lawsuits
related to the alleged backdating of stock options and other related matters, a description of
which can be found below in Part I, Item 3 — Legal Proceedings. There can be no assurance that
these or any actions that have been or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor.
Regardless of whether they are resolved in our favor, these lawsuits are, and any future lawsuits
to which we may become a party will likely be, expensive and time consuming to investigate, defend
and/or resolve. Such costs of investigation and defense, as well as any losses resulting from these
claims, could significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our profitability and cash
flow.

If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs
or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business.

We provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers. If we overestimate our
requirements, the contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess
inventory, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. Conversely, because lead times
for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific
supplier, contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time, if we underestimate our
requirements, the contract manufacturers may have inadequate time or materials and components
required to produce our products, which could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and
result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues.

If we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and
processes, our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly
evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process. We will need to continue
to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order
to manage our business effectively in the future. If we fail to continue to implement improved
systems and processes, our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be
negatively affected.

Our ability to develop, market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or
hire key personnel.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of key
executive, engineering, sales, marketing and support personnel. The supply of highly qualified
individuals, in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas, or sales people
specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets, is limited and competition for such
individuals is intense. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement
for any specific term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to
attract or retain key personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly
engineers



and sales people, and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees,
could delay the development and introduction of new products, and negatively impact our ability to
market, sell or support our products.

Our reported financial results could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or
other intangible assets with indefinite lives.

We are required to annually test, and review on an interim basis, our goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives, including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any
future acquisitions, to determine if impairment has occurred. If such assets are deemed impaired,
an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the
assets would be recognized. This would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would
reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to
have occurred. For example, such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock
falls below certain levels for a sustained period or if the portions of our business related to
companies we have acquired fail to grow at expected rates or decline. In the second quarter of
2006, this impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of $1,280.0 million to the carrying value
of goodwill on our balance sheet for the SLT operating segment, primarily due to the decline in the
Company’s market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to
the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used
in the income approach.. Further declines in our stock prices in the future as well as any marked
decline in our level of revenues or gross margins increase the risk that goodwill and intangible
assets may become impaired in future periods. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of
any impairment of assets.

Litigation or claims regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming, expensive and
require a significant amount of resources to prosecute, defend or make our products
non-infringing.

Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related
to patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related
standards that are relevant to our products. For example, in 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed a
lawsuit against us, alleging that our products infringe certain Toshiba patents. The asserted
claims and/or initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers or
customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products.
Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation
and may require us to develop non-infringing technologies or enter into license agreements.
Furthermore, because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not
necessarily predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts
of money. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third
party is successful, if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money, or
if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license required proprietary rights on
commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results and financial
condition could be materially and adversely affected.

The long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well as our expectation that some
customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause our revenues and
operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

A customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of
its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. As a result, the sales
cycle may be lengthy. In particular, customers making critical decisions regarding the design and
implementation of large or next-generation networks may engage in very lengthy procurement
processes that may delay or impact expected future orders. Throughout the sales cycle, we may spend
considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use
and benefits of our products. Even after making the decision to purchase, customers may deploy our
products slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set
of the customer, the size of the network deployment, the complexity of the customer’s network
environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the
products. Customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a
periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an
irregular basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will tend to
sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause revenues and operating results to
vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter.

We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, which
makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face
increased challenges in supply chain management in the future.

With the current demand for electronic products, component shortages are possible and the
predictability of the availability of such components may be limited. Growth in our business and
the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project
overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels. If shortages or delays persist,
the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all. We may
not be able to secure enough components at



reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our
revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. For example,
throughout the first quarter of 2006 we experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of
shipments of product until late in the quarter and in an increase in our day sales outstanding. We
currently purchase numerous key components, including ASICs, from single or limited sources. The
development of alternate sources for those components is time consuming, difficult and costly. In
addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes
in quantities and delivery schedules. In the event of a component shortage or supply interruption
from these suppliers, we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner.
If, as a result, we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our
requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver product to our customers, which
would seriously impact present and future sales, which would, in turn, adversely affect our
business.

In addition, the development, licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may
increase the complexity of supply chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of key
components and products would adversely affect our business.

We are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long-term supply contracts,
and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions
that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships.

We depend primarily on independent contract manufacturers (each of whom is a third party
manufacturer for numerous companies) to manufacture our products. Although we have contracts with
our contract manufacturers, those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a
long-term basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price. In addition, it is time
consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships.
Therefore, if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if
one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our
manufacturing operations, or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or
contract manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also,
the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of
our supply chain management. Moreover, an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in
China and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in other
countries. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial results.

Integration of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our
financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders.

We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in order to enhance our business. In 2005
we completed the acquisitions of Funk, Acorn, Peribit, Redline and Kagoor. Acquisitions involve
numerous risks, including problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products,
unanticipated costs, diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses, adverse effects
on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks associated with entering
markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products,
technologies or personnel that we might acquire. The integration of businesses that we have
acquired has been, and will continue to be, a complex, time consuming and expensive process. For
example, although we completed the acquisition of NetScreen in April 2004, integration of the
NetScreen products is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future. Acquisitions
may also require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership of our current stockholders,
assume liabilities, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to
impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization
expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write-offs and
restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our operating results and
financial condition.

In addition, if we fail in our integration efforts with respect to our acquisitions and are
unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and
communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls and human resources practices, our
business and financial condition may be adversely affected.

We expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be
sustainable.

Our product gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter and the recent level of gross
margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors,
including product mix shifts, increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we
compete, increases in material or labor costs, excess product component or obsolescence charges
from our contract manufacturers, increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges
incurred due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product
demand, warranty related issues, or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with
different pricing and cost structures.



We are required to expense equity compensation given to our employees, which has reduced our
reported earnings, will significantly harm our operating results in future periods and may reduce
our stock price and our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain
employees.

We historically have used stock options as a significant component of our employee
compensation program in order to align employees’ interests with the interests of our stockholders,
encourage employee retention, and provide competitive compensation packages. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board has adopted changes that require companies to record a charge to
earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives. We adopted this standard
effective January 1, 2006. By causing us to record significantly increased compensation costs, such
accounting changes have reduced, and will continue to reduce, our reported earnings, will
significantly harm our operating results in future periods, and may require us to reduce the
availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees, which may make it more
difficult for us to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Moreover, if securities analysts,
institutional investors and other investors adopt financial models that include stock option
expense in their primary analysis of our financial results, our stock price could decline as a
result of reliance on these models with higher expense calculations. Each of these results could
materially and adversely affect our business.

Our ability to process orders and ship products is dependent in part on our business systems and
upon interfaces with the systems of third parties such as our suppliers or other partners. If our
systems, the systems of those third parties or the interfaces between them fail, our business
processes could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed.

Some of our business processes depend upon our information technology systems and on
interfaces with the systems of third parties. For example, our order entry system feeds information
into the systems of our contract manufacturers, which enables them to build and ship our products.
If those systems fail, our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all. This could
negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business, and our financial
results could be harmed. For example, although it did not adversely affect our shipments, an
earthquake in late December of 2006 disrupted communications with China, where a significant part
of our manufacturing occurs.

Our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors, our business could be
adversely affected and we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any
alleged or actual failure of our products and services.

Our products are highly technical and complex, are critical to the operation of many networks
and, in the case of our security products, provide and monitor network security and may protect
valuable information. Our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors,
defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after a
product has been installed and used by end customers. Any errors or security vulnerabilities
discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in
revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could
adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we could face claims for
product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is
costly and may divert management’s attention. In addition, if our business liability insurance
coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our
financial condition could be harmed.

A breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products, which could
cause us to lose revenues.

If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of
our security products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market
perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. This could cause us to lose
current and potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential value-added resellers
and distributors. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks
change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be
unable to anticipate these techniques.

If our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations will be delayed or
cancelled and could harm our business.

Our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks, each of which
have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other
vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been
added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products will be required to
interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in
order to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in
the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix
or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing
software and hardware, which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results. In
addition, if our products do not interoperate with those of our



customers’ networks, demand for our products could be adversely affected, orders for our
products could be cancelled or our products could be returned. This could hurt our operating
results, damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects.

Due to the global nature of our operations, economic or social conditions or changes in a
particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses,
which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.

We conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through
our distributors and value-added resellers in countries throughout the world and also depend on the
operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located inside and outside of the
United States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety
of uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others, political or social unrest, natural
disasters, epidemic disease, war, or economic instability in a specific country or region, trade
protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or
export our products from various countries, service provider and government spending patterns
affected by political considerations and difficulties in staffing and managing international
operations. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, costs,
expenses, results of operations and financial condition.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our
financial results and cash flows.

Because a majority of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to
adverse movements in non-US currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as
business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and
cash flows.

The majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in US Dollars. We also have some
transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen, Hong Kong
Dollar, British Pound and the Euro, related to our sales and service operations outside of the
United States. An increase in the value of the US Dollar could increase the real cost to our
customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in US Dollars,
and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw
materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies.

Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and
liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign
currency cash flows. The hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of
currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. If our attempts to
hedge against these risks are not successful, our net income could be adversely impacted.

Our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party technology and if licenses of
third-party technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive, our
revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected.

We integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From time to time,
we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or
product enhancements. Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us
on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses
required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new
products and product enhancements, could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower
quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure
our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market
requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively
scale our business and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and
conditions. In periods of market expansion, we have increased investment in our business by, for
example, increasing headcount and increasing our investment in research and development and other
parts of our business. Conversely, during 2001 and 2002, in response to downward trending industry
and market conditions, we restructured our business and reduced our workforce. Many of our
expenses, such as real estate expenses, can not be rapidly or easily adjusted as a result of
fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees. Moreover, rapid changes in the size of our
workforce could adversely affect the ability to develop and deliver products and services as
planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives.



We are subject to risks arising from our international operations.

We derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations, and we plan to
continue expanding our business in international markets in the future. As a result of our
international operations, we are affected by economic, regulatory and political conditions in
foreign countries, including changes in IT spending generally, the imposition of government
controls, changes or limitations in trade protection laws, unfavorable changes in tax treaties or
laws, natural disasters, labor unrest, earnings expatriation restrictions, misappropriation of
intellectual property, acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors,
which could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations. In particular, in
some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection. Moreover, local laws and
customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the United States. In many foreign
countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common for others to engage in
business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United States
regulations applicable to us. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees,
contractors and agents will not take actions in violations of them. Violations of laws or key
control policies by our employees, contractors or agents could result in financial reporting
problems, fines, penalties, or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

While we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are
exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on, and our
independent auditors to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing
necessary to comply with these requirements. We have and will continue to incur significant
expenses and devote management resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. In the
event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered public
accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not
effective as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could
cause a decline in the market price of our stock.

Governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our
revenues.

The United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license
requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
technology. In addition, from time to time, governmental agencies have proposed additional
regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of
private encryption keys. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports
or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could
harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues.

Regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future
prospects.

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition
could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications
industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce
on IP networks. We could be adversely affected by regulation of IP networks and commerce in any
country where we operate. Such regulations could address matters such as voice over the Internet or
using Internet Protocol, encryption technology, and access charges for service providers. In
addition, regulations have been adopted with respect to environmental matters, such as the Waste
Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous
Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) regulations adopted by the European Union,
as well as regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do
not meet specified local certification criteria. Compliance with such regulations may be costly and
time-consuming for us and our suppliers and partners. The adoption and implementation of such
regulations could decrease demand for our products, and at the same time could increase the cost of
building and selling our products as well as impact our ability to ship products into affected
areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results and financial condition.

Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or
other tax returns could adversely affect our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than
anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings
in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are
subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and
other tax authorities. We regularly assess



the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy
of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these
continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial
condition.

ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

ITEM 2. Properties

We lease approximately 1.5 million square feet worldwide, with nearly 75 percent being in
North America. Our corporate headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California and consists of five
buildings totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet. Each building is subject to an individual
lease or sublease, which provides various option, expansion and extension provisions. The corporate
headquarters leases expire between January 2008 and May 2014. We also own approximately 80 acres of
land adjacent to our leased corporate headquarters location. Additionally, we lease an
approximately 0.2 million square foot facility in Westford, Massachusetts. The leases expire
between January and March 2011.

In addition to our offices in Sunnyvale and Westford, we also lease offices in various
locations throughout the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and
the Asia Pacific region, including offices in China, India, Ireland, Israel, Hong Kong, Japan, the
Netherlands, Russia, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. Our longest lease expires in May
2016. Our current offices are in good condition and appropriately support our business needs.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

We are subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, such
as employment or intellectual property claims, including, but not limited to, the matters described
below. The outcome of any such matters is currently not determinable. Although we do not expect
that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations, an adverse result in one or more matters
could negatively affect our results in the period in which they occur.

Stock Option Lawsuits

Federal Derivative Lawsuits

Between May 24, 2006 and August 17, 2006, seven purported shareholder derivative actions were
filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against us and
certain of our current and former officers and directors. The lawsuits allege that our officers and
directors either participated in illegal back-dating of stock option grants or allowed it to
happen. The lawsuits assert causes of action for violations of federal securities laws, violations
of California securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breaches of
fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, gross
mismanagement, insider selling and constructive fraud. The actions also demand an accounting and
rescission of allegedly improper stock option grants. On October 19, 2006, the Court ordered the
consolidation of these actions as

In Re Juniper Derivative Actions

, No. 06-03396, and appointed as
the lead plaintiffs Timothy Hill, Employer-Teamsters Local Nos. 175 & 505 Pension Trust Fund, and
Indiana State District Council of Laborers and HOD Carriers Pension Fund. The Court ordered lead
plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint no later than January 12, 2007. On February 14, 2007,
the parties agreed to extend the deadline for plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint until
thirty days after we complete the filing of our restated financial statements with the Securities
Exchange Commission and the court approved the stipulation on February 15, 2007.

State Derivative Lawsuits — California

On May 24 and June 2, 2006, two purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the
Santa Clara County Superior Court in the State of California against us and certain of our current
and former officers and directors. These two actions were consolidated as

In re Juniper Networks
Derivative Litigation,

No. 1:06CV064294, by order dated June 20, 2006. A consolidated complaint was
filed on July 17, 2006. The consolidated complaint alleges that certain of our current and former
officers and directors either participated in illegal back-dating of stock options or allowed it to
happen. The complaint asserts causes of action for unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty,
abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste, and violations of California securities laws for
insider selling. Plaintiffs also demand an accounting and rescission of allegedly improper stock
options grants. On July 28, 2006, the defendants filed a motion



to stay all discovery in this action. On August 16, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to
dismiss or stay this action in favor of the federal derivative actions pending in the Northern
District of California. Plaintiffs have not yet filed their oppositions to those two motions. On
November 6, 2006, the parties stipulated that the plaintiffs could file a motion to amend their
complaint and a motion to compel responses to discovery no later than thirty days after we complete
the filing of our restated financial statements, and that the hearing on the defendants’ two
pending motions will be heard on the same date as the plaintiffs’ two contemplated motions.

Federal Securities Class Actions

On July 14, 2006, a purported class action complaint styled

Garber v. Juniper Networks, Inc.,
et al.,

No. C-06-4327 MJJ, was filed in the Northern District of California against us and certain
of our officers and directors. The plaintiff filed a Corrected Complaint on July 28, 2006. The

Garber

class action is brought on behalf of all purchasers of Juniper Networks’ common stock
between September 1, 2003 and May 22, 2006. On August 29, 2006, another purported class action
complaint styled

Peters v. Juniper Networks, Inc., et al.,

No. C 06 5303 JW, was filed in the
Northern District of California against us and certain of our officers and directors. The

Peters

class action is brought on behalf of all purchasers of Juniper Networks’ common stock between April
10, 2003 and August 10, 2006. Both of these purported class actions allege that we and certain of
our officers and directors violated federal securities laws by manipulating stock option grant
dates to coincide with low stock prices and issuing false and misleading statements including,
among others, incorrect financial statements due to the improper accounting of stock option grants.
On November 20, 2006, the Court appointed the New York City Pension Funds as lead plaintiffs. The
lead plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint on January 12, 2007. The Consolidated
Complaint asserts claims on behalf of all purchasers of, or those who otherwise acquired, Juniper
Networks’ publicly traded securities from April 10, 2003 through and including August 20, 2006. The
Consolidated Complaint alleges violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 by us and certain of our current and former officers and directors. On February 15,
2007, the parties agreed that plaintiffs may file an Amended Consolidated Complaint within thirty
days after we file our restated financial statements with the Securities Exchange Commission and
the court approved the stipulation on February 16, 2007.

Other Matters

IPO Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG
Cowen Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase (Hambrecht & Quist
LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc., Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated (collectively, the “Underwriters”), our Company and certain of
our officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of our common stock in our initial
public offering in June 1999 and our secondary offering in September 1999.

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that the prospectus pursuant to which
shares of common stock were sold in our initial public offering and our subsequent secondary
offering contained certain false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the practices of
the Underwriters with respect to their allocation of shares of common stock in these offerings and
their receipt of commissions from customers related to such allocations. Various plaintiffs have
filed actions asserting similar allegations concerning the initial public offerings of
approximately 300 other issuers. These various cases pending in the Southern District of New York
have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as

In re Initial Public Offering Securities
Litigation

, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the
action against us, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Defendants in the coordinated proceeding filed motions to dismiss. In October 2002,
our officers were dismissed from the case without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation. On February
19, 2003, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss, but declined to
dismiss the claims against us.

In June 2004, a stipulation for the settlement and release of claims against the issuer
defendants, including us, was submitted to the Court for approval. The terms of the settlement, if
approved, would dismiss and release all claims against participating defendants (including us). In
exchange for this dismissal, Directors and Officers insurance carriers would agree to guarantee a
recovery by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants of at least $1.0 billion, and the issuer
defendants would agree to an assignment or surrender to the plaintiffs of certain claims the issuer
defendants may have against the underwriters. On August 31, 2005, the Court confirmed preliminary
approval of the settlement. On April 24, 2006, the Court held a fairness hearing in connection with
the motion for final approval of the settlement. The Court did not issue a ruling on the motion for
final approval at the fairness hearing. The settlement remains subject to a number of conditions,
including final court approval. On December 5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
reversed the Court’s October 2004 order certifying a class in the case against us, which along with
five other issuers, was



selected as a test case by the underwriter defendants and plaintiffs in the coordinated
proceeding. It is unclear what impact this will have on the settlement and the case against us.

Toshiba Patent Infringement Litigation

On November 13, 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed suit in the United States District Court in
Delaware against us, alleging that certain of our products infringe four Toshiba patents, and
seeking an injunction and unspecified damages. A Markman hearing was held in April 2006, and a
ruling favorable to us was issued on June 28, 2006. Toshiba stipulated to non-infringement of the
four patents and filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The
Delaware court has removed the trial, previously scheduled for August 2006, from its calendar,
pending resolution of the appeal. We expect the appeal will not be heard before July 2007.

IRS Notices of Proposed Adjustments

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has concluded an audit of our federal income tax returns
for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. During 2004, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”)
from the IRS. While the final resolution of the issues raised in the NOPA is uncertain, we do not
believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations. We are also under routine examination by certain state
and non-US tax authorities. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably
foreseeable outcome related to these audits.

In conjunction with the IRS income tax audit, certain of our US payroll tax returns are
currently under examination for fiscal years 1999 — 2001, and we received a second NOPA in the
amount of $11.7 million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing of tax
deposits related to employee stock option exercises. We responded to this NOPA in February 2005,
and intend to dispute this assessment with the IRS. An initial appeals conference was held on
January 31, 2006 and October 3, 2006. The appeals process available to the Company has not been
concluded. In the event that this issue is resolved unfavorably to us, there exists the possibility
of a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year covered by this report.



PART II

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities

(a)

Our common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “JNPR”, and
has been quoted on NASDAQ since June 25, 1999. Prior to that time, there was no public market
for the common stock. All stock information has been adjusted to reflect the three-for-one
split, effected in the form of a stock dividend to each stockholder of record as of December
31, 1999 and a two-for-one split, effected in the form of a stock dividend to each stockholder
of record as of May 15, 2000. Juniper Networks has never paid cash dividends on its common
stock and has no present plans to do so. There were approximately 1,555 stockholders of record
at January 31, 2007 and we have a substantially larger number of beneficial owners. The
following table sets forth the high and low closing bid prices as reported on NASDAQ:

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Report”), including the “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, contains forward-looking statements
regarding future events and the future results of our Company that are based on current
expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which we operate and the
beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as ‘expects,’ ‘anticipates,’ ‘targets,’
‘goals,’ ‘projects,’ ‘intends,’ ‘plans,’ ‘believes,’ ‘seeks,’ ‘estimates,’ variations of such
words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and
adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or
contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report
under the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports
we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), specifically the most recent reports
on

Form 10-Q

. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking
statements for any reason.

The information below has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of our financial results
which is more fully described in the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1, and
in Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of this Form 10-K.

The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. In the course of operating our business, we
routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of
receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of
supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these
decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions,
we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition,
internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. On an
on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing
credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets,
especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and
obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of stock-based compensation, and
litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Overview of the Results of Operations

To aid in understanding our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006, we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and
a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful.

Significant Events

Business and Market Environment

The year of 2006 marked our 10

th

anniversary and a year of considerable progress
which culminated with record revenue results for both the year and in the fourth quarter. In
addition, Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) has added the company to the S&P 500 Index as of the close of
trading on June 1, 2006. During 2006, there has been and continues to be consolidation in the
telecommunications industry (for example, the acquisitions of AT&T Inc., MCI, Inc. and BellSouth
Corporation) and consolidation among the large vendors of telecommunications equipment and
services, such as the combination of Alcatel S.A. and Lucent Technologies Inc. and the acquisition
of Redback Networks, Inc. by Ericsson.

We believe our innovation and market momentum have also allowed us to build partnerships with
other market leaders, which we announced in 2006, including Avaya Inc., Microsoft Corporation, NEC
and Symantec Corporation.

Our total installed base of products has grown to approximately $8.6 billion across more than
100 countries worldwide. These numbers are the result of more than 400,000 units shipped to over
20,000 customers thanks to the help of more than 9,000 partners since our inception.



In 2006, we had major Next Generation Network (“NGN”) wins in the service provider
marketplace, helping us to achieve an overall installed base of over 2,500 units of the T-series in
North America, EMEA and selected countries in Asia. We saw significant success in carriers
selecting equipment for the core of their networks designed to provide multiple types of services,
such as voice, data and video, so called “multi-play”, a strategic focus for us and an important
growth opportunity for the future. We have also seen an increased level of interest in our SLT
portfolio and a growing number of service providers using our SLT products for both managed service
offerings and outsourced solutions for their customers. In fact, the number of service providers
buying our SLT products increased 50% from 2005 to 2006. We successfully delivered the products we
planned to deliver in 2006 despite the risks associated with the long length of product
development, testing and acceptance cycles involved with these products in these markets. We have
made good progress in 2006 and we are building a product portfolio in a market with solid demand
for IP infrastructure.

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements

In this Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 (the “2006 Form 10-K”), we
are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004 as a result of an independent stock option investigation commenced by
the Board of Directors and Audit Committee. This restatement is more fully described in Note 2,
“Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” to Consolidated Financial Statements and in
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
This 2006 Form 10-K will also reflect the restatement of “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” in
Item 6 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In addition, we are
restating our unaudited quarterly financial information and financial statements for interim
periods of 2005, and unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended March 31,
2006.

Financial information included in the reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed by us
prior to August 10, 2006, and the related opinions of our independent registered public accounting
firm, and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued by us, prior to August 10,
2006 should not be relied upon and are superseded in their entirety by this Report and other
reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed by us with the SEC on or after August 10, 2006.

Stock Option Investigation

On May 22, 2006, we issued a press release and Form 8-K announcing that we had received a
request for information relating to our stock option granting practices from the U.S. Attorney’s
Office for the Eastern District of New York. In the same press release and Form 8-K, we announced
that our Board of Directors (the “Board”) had directed the Board’s Audit Committee, comprised of
outside directors, to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices. On May 24, 2006, we
received a letter from the SEC indicating that the SEC was conducting an inquiry regarding Juniper
Networks.

The investigation was conducted with the assistance of independent counsel and forensic
accountants (collectively the “Investigative Team”). The investigation focused on all stock option
grants made to all employees, officers, directors and consultants during the period following our
initial public offering (“IPO”) on June 24, 1999 to May 23, 2006 (the “relevant period”). In
addition, the Audit Committee investigation involved testing and analyses of our hiring,
termination, leave of absence, grant notification and exercise practices regarding stock options
and certain issues regarding grants made before the IPO. The scope of the investigation did not
include a review of options granted by companies acquired by us. All of the companies acquired by
us, with one exception, were privately held companies. None of the acquisitions was accounted for
as a pooling of interests. All of the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method as
provided by Statement of Financial Standards No. 141,

Business Combinations

and its predecessor
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16,

Business Combinations

.

In connection with the investigation, more than 785,000 physical and electronic documents were
reviewed and 35 current and former directors, officers, employees and agents were interviewed.

On December 20, 2006, we announced key findings of the Audit Committee. Key findings of the
Audit Committee are:

•

There were numerous instances in which grant dates were chosen with the benefit of
hindsight as to the price of our stock, so as to give favorable exercise prices. In this
regard, the Audit Committee identified serious concerns regarding the actions of certain
former management in connection with the stock option granting process

•

Formal documentation of stock option grants often lagged the referenced grant date

•

Grants were made by persons or committees who did not have the proper authority to make the grants in question

•

Management failed to exercise sufficient responsibility for the stock option granting process



•

Our CEO, Scott Kriens, received two stock option awards whose measurement dates for
financial accounting purposes differ from the recorded grant dates for such awards. However,
both options were exchanged and cancelled unexercised in 2001 as part of a company-wide
option re-pricing program. Mr. Kriens has not exercised any stock options since 1998,
approximately nine months before our IPO

•

There were substantial changes to our granting procedures after June 9, 2003 and again in
2005. No grants subsequent to 2004 required new measurement dates

•

There was no improper conduct by our Compensation Committee or Board of Directors
regarding the granting of stock options by those bodies

•

Our Audit Committee expressed their continuing confidence in Scott Kriens and the current
management of the Company

Consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC, we have organized
the grants during the relevant period into categories based on grant type and the process by which
the grant was finalized. We analyzed the evidence from the Audit Committee’s investigation related
to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents, electronic documents,
underlying electronic data about documents, and witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and
circumstances, we applied the then appropriate accounting standards to determine, for every grant
within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally
assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in stock-based
compensation expense and related tax effects.

Grants made by our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee to Officers or
Directors

We have concluded that the measurement dates of several grants to executive officers who were
“reporting persons” as that term is defined under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, (“Officers”) and members of the Board of Directors made between June 1999 and
June 2003 were incorrect. In general, during the relevant period, the Board or the Compensation
Committee of the Board made grants to Officers and directors. Grants were sometimes approved at
meetings of these bodies or by action by unanimous written consent. There were several instances in
which grants to Officers or directors were given grant dates (and corresponding exercise prices)
prior to the date on which formal corporate action making the grant was taken. In general, this
appears to have been done to make the grant date coincide with either a specific event, such as the
appointment or re-election of a director or with the purported date options were granted to
non-Officers. In these cases, we have determined that the correct measurement date is the date on
which our Board or Compensation Committee took the action to approve the grant. We also identified
instances in which grants to Officers were granted effective upon a future event, such as the
commencement of employment or closing of an acquisition. In these cases, we have determined that
the date of the future event is the correct measurement date for such grants. We also identified
instances where grants to Officers were made by a body not authorized by our Board to make grants
to Officers and were subsequently ratified by our Board. In those instances, we determined that the
correct measurement date is the date on which such ratification occurred. In connection with the
application of these measurement principles, and after accounting for forfeitures, we have adjusted
the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 5.6 million shares of common stock
resulting in an incremental stock-based compensation expense of $80.3 million on a pre-tax basis
over the respective awards’ vesting terms.

In addition, there was one other grant to an Officer where approval of such grant was not
reflected in minutes of a meeting or an action by unanimous written consent of our Board of
Directors or the Compensation Committee. For that grant, the measurement date was determined based
on the terms of the Officer’s offer letter and the date his employment commenced. With respect to
that grant, we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 1.5 million
shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock-based compensation expense of $6.5 million
on a pre-tax basis over the award’s vesting terms after accounting for forfeitures.

Grants to Non-Officers

We have concluded that the measurement dates of a large number of grants to non-Officers
during the period between June 1999 and December 2004 were incorrect. Our practice has been to
grant stock options, except where prohibited, to nearly all full-time employees in connection with
joining us. To facilitate the granting of options to our rapidly growing workforce, the Board of
Directors established a Stock Option Committee to grant options to non-Officer employees. Between
June 1999 and June 2003, the dates for a large number of grants made by our Stock Option Committee
were chosen with the benefit of hindsight as to the price of our stock, so as to give favorable
exercise prices. Moreover, our Stock Option Committee’s process for finalizing and documenting
these grants was often completed after the originally assigned grant date. Beginning with grants
dated June 20, 2003, we implemented a number of new procedures and policies regarding the granting
of options to non-Officer employees. After that, we have concluded that the pattern of consciously
looking back for the most favorable dates for the employees ceased. However, the documentation and
written approvals of grant dates still generally trailed the recorded grant dates. Based on all
available facts and circumstances, the originally recorded



measurement dates for the grants made by our Stock Option Committee during the period from
July 1999 through December 2004 can not be relied upon in isolation as the correct measurement
dates. In 2005, we made additional changes to our procedures. No grants in 2005 and 2006 required
new measurement dates.

APB 25 defines the measurement date for determining stock-based compensation expense as the
first date on which both (1) the number of shares that an individual employee is entitled to
receive and (2) the option or purchase price, are known. Throughout the relevant period, the
Company’s stock administration department entered the option grant information for grants made by
the Stock Option Committee into its Equity Edge stock administration system. This system was used
to monitor and administer our stock option program. The data in Equity Edge were sent on a regular
basis to designated brokers, allowing grantees to view their options information in their accounts
via the Internet.

For grants made by the Stock Option Committee between June 1999 and December 2004, where there
is no other reliable objective evidence pointing to an earlier single specific date that the number
of shares and the individuals entitled to receive them and the price had become final, we have
determined the Equity Edge entry date to be the most reliable measurement date for calculating
additional stock-based compensation expense under APB 25. Using this measurement date, and after
accounting for forfeitures, we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options
covering 74.2 million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock-based compensation
expense of $636.7 million on a pre-tax basis over the respective awards’ vesting terms.

In many of the cases where the Equity Edge entry date was used as the measurement date, the
formal Stock Option Committee granting documentation (consisting of unanimous written consents or
minutes and related lists of recipients, amounts and types of awards) was not created or completed
until a later date. Because the awards listed in the formal granting documentation did not differ
from the grants entered into Equity Edge, the notice of the awards was made available to employees
prior to the creation or completion of the granting documents, and because the completion of the
documentation was treated as perfunctory, we determined that the Equity Edge entry date was the
proper measurement date under APB 25 rather than the date the Stock Option Committee granting
documentation was completed.

In a number of cases, there was reliable objective evidence pointing to a single specific date
that the number of shares and the individuals entitled to receive them and the price had become
final. Such evidence primarily consisted of electronic data indicating that the granting instrument
and schedule were created prior to the Equity Edge entry date. We also relied on other evidence
such as emails or written agreements to determine the date certain options became final. Such
evidence was used to determine the measurement dates for options for which we have adjusted the
measurement of compensation cost for options covering 27.9 million shares of common stock resulting
in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $141.2 million on a pre-tax basis over the
respective awards’ vesting terms.

We also concluded that there were instances in which clerical errors or omissions regarding
the persons to receive an award or the number of options to be granted were corrected after the
date of award. In the case of most additions made to correct omissions and other corrections that
were not reflected on the grant documentation at the time of the applicable grant date or in
documentation existing at the time of grant, we have determined that a new measurement date should
be established. We considered whether certain of such changes or additions should give rise to
variable accounting treatment and concluded that such treatment was not appropriate because the
grants represented independent decisions or events rather than a continuation or modification of
the other grants. We believe that the correct measurement date for these grants is the date Stock
Administration entered the correction or addition into Equity Edge, except where objective evidence
identifies an earlier date on which the correction was approved. After accounting for forfeitures,
we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 1.3 million shares of
common stock resulting in incremental stock-based compensation of $11.9 million on a pre-tax basis
over the respective awards’ vesting terms.

Stock Option Grant Modifications Connected with Terminations or Leaves of Absences and
Other Matters

Compensation expense was also recognized as a result of modifications that were made to
certain employee option grant awards in connection with certain employees’ terminations or leaves
of absence. Typically such modifications related to extensions of the time employees could exercise
options following their termination of employment or that enabled the employee to vest in
additional shares in relation to a leave of absence. For example, in connection with reductions in
work force in 2001 and 2002, we increased the period for affected employees to exercise their
options from 30 days to 90 days. We have incremental stock-based compensation expense associated
with such terminations or leaves of absence of $20.0 million on a pre-tax basis in the period of
modification.

Compensation expense of $0.2 million on a pre-tax basis was also recognized as a result of
non-employee grants to consultants in exchange for services and other matters.



Judgment

In light of the significant judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates, alternate
approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than
those recorded by us in the restatement. We considered various alternative approaches. For example,
in those cases where the formal documentation of a grant was completed after the date the grant was
entered in Equity Edge, an alternative measurement date to using the Equity Edge entry date could
be the creation date of the documentation. Changing the measurement dates for grants made by our
Stock Option Committee from the Equity Edge entry date to the later of the electronic data creation
date of the unanimous written consent or the related schedule of grants would cause the pre-tax
compensation charges of $636.7 million discussed above to increase by approximately $10.6 million.
Conversely, where we established a new measurement date prior to the Equity Edge entry date for
grants made by our Stock Option Committee to non-Officers based on other evidence, such as the
electronic data indicating the initial creation date of the granting instrument and schedule, an
alternative measurement date could be the Equity Edge entry date. Changing the measurement dates
for these grants by the Stock Option Committee from a date prior to Equity Edge entry date to the
Equity Edge entry would increase the $141.2 million of the pre-tax compensation charges discussed
above by approximately $37.7 million. We believe that the approaches we used were the most
appropriate under the circumstances.

Summary of Stock-Based Compensation Adjustments

We adjusted the measurement dates for options covering a total of 110.5 million, or 76%, of
the 146.0 million shares of common stock covered by options granted during the relevant period.

The impact from on the consolidated statement of operations from recognizing stock-based
compensation expense through December 31, 2006 resulting from the investigation is summarized as
follows (in millions):

In addition to the $894.7 million recognized through fiscal 2005, $2.1 million of
unamortized deferred compensation remained as of December 31, 2005, bringing the total incremental
impact from the investigation to approximately $896.8 million. As required by SFAS 123R, which was
adopted on January 1, 2006, the unamortized deferred compensation of $2.1 million has been
reclassified to additional paid-in capital, along with the unamortized deferred compensation for
stock options assumed from past acquisitions, in our consolidated balance sheet. Beginning in 2006,
the incremental amortization resulting from the investigation is included in stock-based
compensation expense under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004), “

Share-Based Payment”

(“SFAS 123R”). The incremental stock-based compensation
expense from the restatement of employee stock options was $0.6 million, on a pre-tax basis, for
the year ended December 31, 2006.

Other Matters

After considering all available evidence, primarily the then current 2005 operating
projections of future income, which remain appropriate, we have concluded that the previously
recorded valuation allowance related to the tax benefit of stock options deductions should have
been reversed in the fourth quarter of 2005. Accordingly, we decreased the valuation allowance as
of December 31, 2005 by $158.0 million with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital.
The remaining valuation allowance balance of $40.6 million relates to capital losses which will
carry forward to offset future capital gains.

Additionally, we misclassified the tax benefit from deductions from stock options assumed in
acquisitions. Accordingly, we have reduced additional paid-in capital for the years ended December
31, 2005 and 2004 by $6.0 million and $18.5 million, respectively, with a corresponding decrease to
goodwill. The total reduction to both additional paid-in capital and goodwill as of December 31,
2005 was $24.5 million.



Because virtually all holders of options issued by us were not involved in or aware of the
incorrect pricing, we have taken and intend to take actions to deal with certain adverse tax
consequences that may be incurred by the holders of certain incorrectly priced options. The primary
adverse tax consequence is that incorrectly priced stock options vesting after December 31, 2004
may subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar
penalty taxes under California and other state tax laws). We recorded $10.1 million as other
charges in operating expense for 2006 in relation to these items and other tax related items. We
expect to incur future charges to resolve the adverse tax consequences of incorrectly priced
options

We misclassified the gains and losses from the retirement of our treasury shares in fiscal
2004. Accordingly, we reduced our retained earnings (accumulated deficit) as of December 31, 2004
and 2005 by $63.6 million with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.

The impact of recognizing additional stock compensation and other adjustments on each
component of stockholders’ equity at the end of each year is summarized as follows (in millions):

NASDAQ Listing Status

In August 2006, we received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter stating that, as a result of
the delayed filing of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 (the
“Second Quarter Form 10-Q”), we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued
listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and were therefore subject to delisting from
the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In November 2006, we received an additional letter from NASDAQ of
similar substance related to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 (the “Third
Quarter Form 10-Q”). In December 2006, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel granted our request
for continued listing, provided that we file a written summary of our audit committee’s findings
with NASDAQ as well as the Second Quarter Form 10-Q, the Third Quarter Form 10-Q and any required
restatements with the SEC on or before February 12, 2007. In January 2007, we received a notice
from the NASDAQ Listing and Hearings Review Council which advised us that any delisting
determination by the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel has been stayed pending further review by
the Review Council. We have been given until March 30, 2007 to submit additional information to
assist the Review Council in their assessment of our listing status. On February 20, 2007, we filed
a written summary of our Audit Committee’s findings with NASDAQ. In addition, on March 9, 2007, we
filed the Second Quarter Form 10-Q and the Third Quarter Form 10-Q with the SEC. We consider that
the filing of these materials has remedied our non-compliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14),
subject to NASDAQ’s affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to us
accordingly. However, if NASDAQ disagrees with our position or if the SEC disagrees with the manner
in which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact of past stock
option grants, there could be further delays in filing subsequent SEC reports or other actions that
might result in delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We recorded a $1,280.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in our consolidated
statements of operations within the SLT segment to adjust the estimated carrying value of our
goodwill for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006. The impairment of goodwill was primarily
attributable to the decline in the Company’s market capitalization that occurred over a period of
approximately six months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the
forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach. Future impairment indicators, including
further declines in our market capitalization or a decrease in revenue or profitability levels,
could require additional impairment charges to be recorded.



We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered
impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected
to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment charge to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.
We assess the recoverability of our long-lived and intangible assets by determining whether the
unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related
assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net cash
flows. In 2006 and 2005, we recorded impairment charges of $3.4 million and $5.9 million,
respectively, related to certain Kagoor purchased intangibles as a result of a significant
reduction in our forecasted revenue associated with the session border control products.

Stock-Based Compensation

We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, using
the modified prospective transition method and, therefore, have not revised prior periods’ results.
During 2006, we issued stock options to the members of our Board (“outside directors”) and stock
options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and shares of common stock pursuant to equity incentive
plans. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the
vesting of certain unvested and “out-of-the-money” stock options that had an exercise price per
share equal to or greater than $22.00, all of which were previously granted under our stock option
plans and that were outstanding on December 16, 2005. The options accelerated excluded options
previously granted to certain employees, including all of the executive officers and the Board of
Directors of Juniper Networks. Under SFAS 123R, we recorded pre-tax stock-based compensation
expense of $87.6 million in 2006 compared to $22.3 million in 2005 when we recognized stock-based
compensation expense under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”).

Beginning in May 2006, we have adopted the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (“2006 Plan”) which
provides for a maximum term of seven years from the grant date for non-statutory stock options and
for incentive stock options (except that the maximum term is five years from the grant date for
incentive stock options granted to a holder of more than 10% of the Company’s stock). The 2006 Plan
also provides for a defined option granting schedule for our outside directors. Details of the 2006
Plan are described in Note 6, “Stockholders’ Equity,” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
of this Form 10-K.

Stock Repurchase Activities

In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. This program
authorized repurchases of up to $250.0 million of our common stock. In the first quarter of 2006,
we repurchased and retired 10,071,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $18.51 per
share as part of our Common Stock Repurchase Program. No shares were repurchased after the three
months ended March 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, a total of 12,939,700 common shares had been
repurchased and retired since the inception of the program, equating to approximately $250.0
million at an average price of $19.32 per share.

In July 2006, our Board authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we are
authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Company’s common stock. In February 2007, our
Board approved an increase of $1.0 billion under this new share repurchase program. Coupled with
the original $1.0 billion approved in July 2006, we are now authorized to repurchase up to $2.0
billion of our common stock. Purchases under this plan will be subject to a review of the
circumstances in place at the time. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program will be made
from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be
discontinued at any time.

Business Acquisitions

We had no acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2006. We completed a total of six
acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The main purposes of these acquisitions
were to expand our product portfolio and customer base. The results of the following acquisitions
have been included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on their respective
acquisition dates.

The following is a summary of our acquisitions in 2004 and 2005:

•

Funk Software, Inc. (“Funk”) acquired on December 1, 2005: Developed and sold
products designed to protect the integrity of the network by verifying users and devices
that meet an organization’s security policies before granting network access.



Acquisition Related Liabilities

In connection with our acquisitions, we recorded liabilities associated with severance, future
lease, and other obligations. The initial liabilities were recorded as part of the acquisitions and
did not impact the consolidated statements of operations. The following is a summary of these
liabilities:

•

In 2005, we recorded liabilities of $4.5 million for the five acquisitions of that
year, primarily related to future lease, severance, and other contractual obligations. As
of December 31, 2006, there was $1.2 million remaining to be paid, primarily related to
future leases that extend through 2009 and other contractual obligations.

•

At the time of the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, we accrued $21.3 million
primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. As of
December 31, 2006, there was approximately $1.6 million remaining to be paid, primarily
for facility leases that extend through 2008.

•

At the time of the acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc. (“Unisphere”) in 2002,
we accrued $14.8 million primarily related to professional services, severance and
facility charges. As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $0.8 million remaining
to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through March 2011.

Restructuring and Other Related Charges

Restructuring Reserves

We initiated restructuring plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus on
strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align product and operating
expenses with existing general economic conditions. The following is a summary of our restructuring
plans charged to operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations:

•

In 2006, we implemented a restructuring plan which provided for a reduction of 33
employees within the Infrastructure segment during the second and third quarters of 2006.
Total accrual of $2.1 million, consisting primarily of severance and purchase commitment
charges, was recognized as restructuring charges in operating expense and cost of product
revenues in 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had related restructuring reserves of $0.1
million recorded in short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

•

In 2004, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the acquisition of
NetScreen. We initially recorded a charge of approximately $0.4 million primarily related
to workforce reduction costs, which has been completely paid as of December 31, 2006.

•

In 2003, we implemented a restructuring plan, under which we announced that we
would no longer develop our G-series CMTS products and recorded a charge that was
comprised of workforce reduction costs, non-inventory asset impairment, costs associated
with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs. We initially
recorded a charge of approximately $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce
reduction costs, non-inventory asset impairment, vacating facilities costs, the costs
associated with termination of contracts and other related costs. As of December 31,
2006, approximately $1.0 million remained unpaid primarily for a facility lease that
extends through July 2008.



•

In 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the Unisphere
acquisition. We initially recorded a charge of $14.9 million, of which approximately $0.5
million remained unpaid as of December 31, 2006, primarily for facility leases that
extend through April 2009.

We adjusted our restructuring reserves primarily due to changes in lease and sublease
assumptions as our needs changed as a result of our recent acquisitions and as the real estate
markets changed.

See Note 5 in Item 8 for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts
remained to be paid.

Tax Repatriation

We repatriated $225.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act (“Jobs Act”) in 2005. We
recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation dividend. The net
tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million,
offset by a tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on
un-repatriated earnings.

Nature of Expenses

We have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and
increase sales. We have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2006, 2005
and 2004.

Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent
contract manufacturers; accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our
independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract
manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and
standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are
conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent
contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, and the United States.
We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract
manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment.

The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual
component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for
carrying or obsolete material charges.

Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and
we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions,
bonuses, vacation, benefits and travel. We added over 688 employees in 2006 primarily in
engineering and customer service functions as a result of increased investment in customer service
operations to support investment in the enterprise market. In 2005, we added 420 employees across
all functions primarily as a result of acquisitions. We had 4,833, 4,145 and 2,948 employees as of
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments
based on headcount. These departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to
increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional
infrastructure systems to support our growth. We expect to further invest in our internal
information technology infrastructure in 2007.

Research and development expenses include:

•

The costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products,

•

Outside services for such services as certifications of new products, and

•

expenditures associated with equipment used for testing.

Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures,
such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of
which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our research and development
costs as they are incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research and development during
2007 compared to 2006 to further advance our competitive advantage.



Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services,
demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs vary quarter-to-quarter depending on
revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. We plan to continue our investment in sales
and marketing activities in both direct and channel sales. We will expand into new markets,
particularly emerging markets, and continue to expand both our service provider and enterprise
focus. We will also further develop our distribution channel in 2007 in an effort to expand and
grow our presence in new markets, serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of
networking products.

General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other
corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate
strategic services.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and
expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our
estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from
management’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the
actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments
and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:





that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the
future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period
such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that
were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be
reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the
period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities
involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We
recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary,
the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when
we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is
less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result.

•

Litigation and Settlement Costs.

From time to time, we are involved in disputes,
litigation and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation
matters; however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and we cannot
assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved
without costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution
of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments,
which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to
occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be
materially and adversely affected. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum
estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the
following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial
statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had
been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be
reasonably estimated. However, the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially
different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional expenses.

•

Loss Contingencies.

We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies
arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment
of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate
the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is
accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current
information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and
whether new accruals are required.

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The increases in revenues, cost of expenses, and operating expenses in 2006 compared to
2005 were attributable to continued growth primarily driven by increased sales resulting from the
consolidation in the large service providers market and increased success in the enterprise market
in key areas like the U.S. Federal Government. In particular, we experienced sales growth in the
emerging markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia, as well as significant growth in our
sales to the top 10 world-wide service



providers. Our service revenue grew substantially as a result of an increased equipment base,
increased attach rates (the rate that purchases of equipment are accompanied by purchases of
related services) on new sales and new professional services. The
cost of revenues and operating
expenses increases were directly attributable to the revenue growth
and investments in research and development efforts. In addition, we
recognized impairment and other charges in 2006.

Our total net revenues increased $239.6 million, or 12%, to $2,303.6 million in 2006. Our
total net revenues increased by $728.0 million, or 54%, to $2,064.0 million in 2005.

Net Product Revenues

The $122.3 million, or 7%, increase in our product net revenue from 2005 to 2006 was the
result of increased activity in both service provider and enterprise markets. In particular we had
success in selling our products to customers who are adopting next generation networks (“NGN”) IP
networks, which are designed to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple
services over a single network. In addition we had a number of new product releases during 2006 and
expanded into new emerging markets. During 2006 and 2005, we recognized $4.2 million and $32.7
million, respectively, of product net revenue from shipments made to end-users and value-added
resellers that were deferred at the end of the prior year.

Infrastructure products accounted for $1,413.4 million or 75% of our total net product
revenues during 2006 and $1,371.6 million or 77% of our total net product revenues during 2005.
Infrastructure product net revenue grew by $41.8 million or 3% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to
continued success from a very significant year of growth in 2005, which strengthened our position
as a supplier to the largest service providers in the world, particularly in the United States and
in EMEA. This success was partially offset by a pause in the build out of NGNs and associated
purchase decisions, particularly in Japan, as major carriers prepare for the next stage of
bandwidth and services expansion, and a large product revenue deferral for products shipped to
Verizon that is expected to be recognized in 2007. Infrastructure product net revenue increased
40.6% from 2004 to 2005, primarily due to the increase in revenues from service providers and
enterprises as a result of significant success selling into the broadband and core networks for the
service providers across the world and the recognition in the market place of Juniper Networks’
world-class service provider solutions.

SLT products accounted for $479.9 million or 25% of our total product revenue in 2006 and
$399.4 million or 23% of total net product revenues during 2005. SLT product net revenue increased
$80.5 million or 20% from 2005 to 2006 due to a growing demand and brand recognition for our
Security products from large enterprises and the U.S. Federal Government. In addition, the new
products announced in 2006 and those added to our portfolio through the various acquisitions in
2005 contributed to this increase. In addition, we experienced good success in selling SLT products
to service providers for both their own IT infrastructure and resale. Our SLT product revenue
increase in 2005 was primarily driven by the increased demands in security products by the
enterprise market. Additionally, the acquisitions completed in 2005 enabled us to cross sell
infrastructure, security, and application acceleration products to existing customer bases.

An analysis of the change in revenue by Infrastructure and SLT segments, and the change in
units, can be found below in the section titled “Segment Information.”



Net Service Revenues

Net service revenues increased $117.3 million or 40% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an
increase in the customer installed base that we are servicing, as well as increased attach rates on
new product sales, improved enterprise service infrastructure allowing more rapid implementation of
services and the addition of new professional service offerings. Professional service revenue also
increased, to a lesser extent, in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to maintenance-related
on-site engineering services as well as additional consulting projects in 2006. Net service
revenues increased $119.9 million or 69% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth in support
services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. A majority of our service
revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts that
are typically for one-year renewable periods. The increases in support service revenue were
primarily due to the additional technical support service contract initiations associated with
higher product sales, which have resulted in increased renewal and a larger installed base of
equipment being serviced. These contracts are typically for services such as 24-hour customer
support, non-specified updates and hardware repairs. We recognize revenue from service contracts as
the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. In addition to support
services and professional services, we also provide educational services.

We continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic theaters,
and we expect this trend to continue.

Net revenue in the United States increased by $74.0 million in 2006 from 2005 due to continued
success both with enterprise customers such as the U.S. Federal Government, as well as with major
service providers in the United States. The increase was also due in part to sales to major
internet content providers and the cable providers. This success was partially offset by a
significant product revenue deferral for product shipped to Verizon. Net revenue in the United
States as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by two percentage points in 2006 compared to
2005 as a result of the strong growth in EMEA. Total 2006 revenue recorded by the Americas region
grew by $98.5 million from its 2005 level and remained at 45% of worldwide revenue, as compared to
2005, due to significant success with the main service providers in Canada and various South
American countries including Brazil and Argentina. Revenue in the EMEA region grew by $202.6
million or five percentage points in 2006 due to significant success with NGN deployments across
the region, in particular Sweden, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, as well as sales growth in
emerging regions including Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Revenue from the Asia
Pacific region declined $61.5 million or 12% primarily due to the impact of certain NGN project
decision delays in Japan driving revenue down year over year, partially offset by increased demands
in China.

Net revenue in the United States as a percentage of total net revenue increased from 2004 to
2005 primarily due to the growth driven by increased demand within the service provider and
enterprise markets. Net revenue in EMEA as a percentage of total net revenue increased in 2005
compared to 2004 primarily due to strength across the region, including Germany and the United
Kingdom. Net revenue in other Asia Pacific countries as a percentage of total net revenue remained
fairly consistent with prior years.

Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net product and service revenues for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004. We expect that our largest customers, as well as key strategic
partners, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our



net revenue in 2007 and for the foreseeable future particularly due to the consolidation that
continues to impact both our customers and partners.

Cost of Product Revenues

Cost of product revenues increased $48.8 million or 10% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The
increase was primarily attributable to increased product revenue in both the enterprise and service
provider markets. Net product gross margin of 71% for 2006 fell by less than one percentage point
compared to that in 2005 despite increased competitive pressure due to the impact of the mix of
products; the mix of territories and reduced manufacturing costs. We expect to see increasing price
competition and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future. The increase in stock
compensation expense in cost of product revenue from 2005 to 2006 of $0.9 million was primarily due
to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006.

The two percentage point decrease in product gross margins from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due
to increasing competition as certain of our products have become more mature in their product
cycles. As we expanded our market share and entered more markets since 2004, we experienced
increasing price competition. Nevertheless, higher product revenue volume contributed to the
increased gross margin by $420.6 million, or 50%, in 2005 when compared to 2004.

Cost of Service Revenues

Cost of service revenues increased $52.0 million in 2006 as compared to that in 2005. The
increase was a direct result of a larger installed base of products covered by service contracts.
However, our service gross margin increased one percentage point from 2005 to 2006 as a result of
improved efficiencies and economies of scale, which result in a better leveraged service
organization. Total employee salary and related expenses as a percentage of service revenue were:
20% for 2006, 20% for 2005 and 26% for 2004; however, in absolute dollars, employee salary and
related expenses increased $22.3 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an investment in new
customer service personnel, particularly to support our enterprise customers. Stock compensation
expense in cost of service revenue also increased by $4.1 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due
to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. In addition to personnel expenses, outside services
costs increased $7.1 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to contracting for engineers to
provide professional services revenue, particularly for the Middle East and other emerging markets.
Spares and shipping expenses increased $7.3 million and $5.6 million, respectively, from 2005 to
2006 due to a significant investment in spares around the world to support the increase in customer
contracts, particularly in the enterprise market. Finally, the costs associated with facilities,
depreciation and other expenses increased $4.9 million in cost of service revenue from 2005 to 2006
due to increases in revenue and investment in infrastructure to support the growing business.

Service gross margins increased six percentage points from 2004 to 2005 and, increase was
primarily attributable to a larger revenue increase when compared to the increase in cost of
headcount, outside services, and spares purchases, all of which were needed to support the growing
installed base. Total employee related expenses as a percentage of service revenue for 2005
decreased to 20% compared to 26% in 2004. Nevertheless, in absolute dollars, total service related
costs increased $50.9 million from 2004 to 2005: employee related expenses increased $20.2 million,
and outside service expenses increased by $17.5 million as a result of increased headcount during
2005. In addition, expense associated with spares increased by $7.1 million.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased $122.9 million, or four percentage points of net
revenue, in 2006 over 2005 as a result of our focus on the development of a broader portfolio of
networking products. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel
related expenses of $61.7 million, depreciation of $12.4 million, facility related expenses of
$10.5 million, engineering and testing expenses of $8.3 million, outside service expenses of $3.5
million and equipment related expenses of $2.1 million. The increases in personnel related expenses
in 2006 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization across the
Infrastructure and SLT segments. Headcount increased 19% from 1,736 individuals to 2,070
individuals during 2006. The headcount increase was attributable to product innovation efforts in
areas including routers security and integration in order to capture potential future NGN
infrastructure growth and other opportunities in the enterprise and the service provider markets.
To a lesser extent, the increases in personnel expenses were attributable to merit-based salary
increases beginning in April 2006. Facility, engineering and testing expense increased in 2006 to
support our product innovation efforts. Outside service expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to
additional consulting projects on developing future product roadmaps. The increase in stock
compensation expense in research and development expenses from 2005 to 2006 of $24.0 million was
primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. We continue to invest in both
stand-alone as well as integrated products in order to satisfy our customer needs. Our investment
and expansion on our global research and development efforts were primarily in China and India.

Research and development expenses increased $92.9 million in 2005 compared to 2004, but
decreased by 3% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to
increases in personnel related expenses of $66.4 million, facility related expenses of $14.1
million, engineering and testing expenses of $12.6 million, equipment related expenses of $8.5
million, and depreciation of $5.1 million. The increases in personnel related expenses in 2005 were
primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization, including those from the five
acquisitions. The increase was partially offset by the decrease in research and development related
stock compensation expense of $14.3 million compared to 2004 as a result of forfeitures of unvested
options in 2005 and additional compensation expense recorded as a result of our restatement
discussed in Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements.” In addition, we invested
and expanded on our global research and development efforts, specifically in China and India.

Sales and Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses increased $116.4 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased
as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases
in personnel related expenses of $58.9 million, increases in facility related expense of $12.0
million, increases in travel expenses of $10.3 million, increases in marketing related activities
of $6.6 million, and increases in equipment related expenses of $2.6 million. Personnel related
expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional hires to support the expansion of our
distribution channels and customer base, as well as to support the larger portfolio of products. In
particular, we expanded our enterprise sales force, and targeted key growth areas such as China,
Middle East and India. We added 171 individuals to our sales and marketing function during 2006.
Travel expense increased in 2006 due primarily to increased headcount and more activity in emerging
markets. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities
designed to expand and improve our brand recognition, support of our distribution channels,
introduction of new products, targeted solution value propositions and increase awareness of our
existing products to a broader range of customers. Equipment related expenses increased in 2006 due
to the introduction of new products. The increase in stock compensation expense in sales and
marketing from 2005 to 2006 of $24.5 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R
in 2006.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $117.3 million in 2005 compared to 2004 but decreased
as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases
in personnel related expenses of $97.3 million, increases in marketing



related activities of $10.9 million, and increases in equipment related expenses of $2.6
million. Personnel related expenses increased in 2005 primarily due to additional hires, including
acquisitions, to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base, as well as
to support the larger portfolio of products. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a
result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our distribution channels,
introduction of new products, and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of
customers. Stock-based compensation pertaining to sales and marketing functions was $6.8 million
and $22.0 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased $22.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and
remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in
personnel related expenses of $5.6 million and other related expense. General and administrative
world-wide headcount increased 11%, or by 24 individuals, during 2006, to support the overall
growth in the business. The net change in bad debt expense reversal increased $2.3 million due
primarily to the bad debt expense reversal in 2005. Facility and IT related expense increased $1.2
million as a result of our personnel growth and development of our systems infrastructure. The
increase of general and administrative related stock compensation expense from 2005 to 2006 of
$11.8 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006.

General and administrative expenses increased $19.5 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and
remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in
personnel related expenses of $10.6 million and a $10.0 million patent related expense. The $10.0
million patent expense pertained to an agreement we entered into with a third-party to avoid future
disputes. Stock-based compensation pertaining to general and administrative function was $1.2
million and $2.2 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets

Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased $6.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005 as
a result of recognizing a full year of amortization associated with the five acquisitions completed
in 2005. The amortization of purchased intangible assets increased $28.4 million in 2005 compared
to 2004 primarily due to the additional intangible assets from the five acquisitions completed in
2005. See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets.

Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Impairment charges increased by $1,283.4 million in 2006 as a result of the impairment of both
goodwill and purchased intangible assets during 2006. Due primarily to the decline in the Company’s
market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to the
impairment review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in
the income approach, we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill and reduced the goodwill
within the SLT segment by $1,280.0 million. In addition, we recorded a $3.4 million impairment
expense pertaining to a write-down of intangible assets as a result of a decrease in forecasted
revenue for the SBC stand-alone products during the second quarter of 2006. In 2005, we wrote down
$5.9 million of purchased intangible assets acquired from Kagoor.



In-Process Research and Development

No charges related to in-process research and development were incurred in 2006. In 2005, a
total of $11.0 million was charged to IPR&D expense in connection with three of our five
acquisitions during the year. Of the total Funk purchase price, $5.3 million was allocated to
in-process research and development (“IPR&D”). Of the total Peribit purchase price, $3.8 million
was allocated to IPR&D. Of the total Kagoor purchase price, $1.9 million was allocated to IPR&D.
None of the Acorn or Redline purchase prices were allocated to IPR&D. In 2004, $27.5 million was
allocated to IPR&D from the NetScreen acquisition and was expensed during the year.

Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not yet reached technological
feasibility and which have no alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being
equivalent to a beta-phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the
development. At the time of acquisition, Funk, Peribit, Kagoor, and NetScreen had multiple IPR&D
efforts under way for certain current and future product lines.

For Funk, these efforts included development of new versions for the Steel-Belted Radius
(“SBR”), SBR High Availability (“HA”), and Mobile IP Module (“MIM”) II products — all related to
the Radius product offering. IPR&D as of the acquisition date also included development of new
versions for Endpoint Assurance, Proxy (Remote Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time
of the Funk acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the
next four months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.9 million.

For Peribit, these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the
Sequence Reducer (“SR”) family, Sequence Mirror (“SM”) family, the Central Management System
(“CMS”) products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of the
Peribit acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the
next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million.

For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation
products and operating systems. At the time of the Kagoor acquisition, it was estimated that these
development efforts would be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of
approximately $0.8 million.

For NetScreen, these efforts included integrating secure routers with embedded encryption
chips, as well as other functions and features such as next generation Internet Protocol (“IP”),
wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability. We utilized the
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method to value the IPR&D, using rates ranging from 20% to 25%,
depending on the estimated useful life of the technology. In applying the DCF method, the value of
the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected
to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated, over the remaining
economic life of the technology. To distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the
underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating
product revenues, adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working
capital, and other assets that provide value to the product lines. At the time of the NetScreen
acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next
eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately $25.0 million.

As of December 31, 2006, the estimated costs to complete the above research and development
efforts were immaterial.

Other Charges, Net

Other charges are summarized as follows:

§

Restructuring and Acquisition Related Reserves.

We recorded net restructuring and
acquisition related bonus expenses of $5.9 million in 2006, of which $5.6 million
pertained to bonus accruals associated with the Funk and Acorn acquisitions and $0.3
million pertained to net restructuring related charges. During 2006, we accrued $0.7
million in restructuring charges due to the initiation of a restructuring plan which
focused on some product development costs reductions and the discontinuation of our SBC
product. The $6.5 million credit to restructuring and acquisition related expenses in
2005 primarily consisted of $6.9 million in adjustments related to our restructuring
accrual when we re-occupied a portion of the former NetScreen facility that was
previously included in this acquisition related restructuring reserve, partially offset
by a $0.3 million bonus and earn-out accrual related to the Funk and Acorn acquisitions.
In 2004, we also recorded net adjustments of $5.1 million to the previously established
restructuring reserves primarily for changes in estimates related to changes in lease and
sublease assumptions.



§

Integration Costs.

We had no significant costs in either 2006 or 2005 related to the
integration of acquired product lines or business units during those years. We
recognized $5.1 million in integration costs for the NetScreen acquisition in 2004.
Integration expenses are incremental costs directly related to the integration of the
two companies. The integration expenses consisted principally of facility related
expenses, workforce related expenses and professional fees. We estimate that the
majority of the integration costs related to our 2005 and 2004 acquisitions have been
incurred and that there will be an immaterial amount of additional integration costs for
these acquisitions in the foreseeable future.

§

Stock Option Investigation Costs.

We recorded expenses of $20.5 million in 2006
relating to professional fees and other costs necessary to conduct our independent stock
option investigation.

§

Tax Related Charges.

We recorded $10.1 million in operating expense during 2006 in
relation to certain taxes associated with stock option grants to employees.

Interest and other income increased $45.2 million from 2005 to 2006 and $30.9 million from
2004 to 2005 as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, and an increase
in rates of return realized from our investments.

Interest expense decreased $0.3 million from 2005 and 2006 primarily due to lower portfolio
management fees. Interest and other expenses decreased $1.5 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due
to the retirement of our subordinated notes during 2004, resulting in savings of $2.5 million,
which was partially offset by foreign exchange related losses from balance sheet revaluation and
bank fees.

We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at
cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the
ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. In 2006, there were no permanent
changes in the market value of these holdings, and therefore we made no change to the valuation of
these assets. During 2005 and 2004, we wrote-down these investments by $0.4 million and $2.9
million respectively, for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary.

In 2005, we recorded a gain of $1.7 million in connection with a business combination
transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio. Our cost basis of this equity
investment was $1.0 million.

Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes decreased to $104.4 million in 2006 from $146.8 million in 2005.
The 2006 effective rate was (11.6%) and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily
due to the inability to benefit from a substantial portion of the goodwill impairment charge
recorded in 2006.

Provision for income taxes increased to $146.8 million in 2005 from $79.9 million in 2004. The
2005 effective rate was 29.5% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to
the benefit of tax credits, income in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates and a reduction in
deferred tax liabilities related to the repatriation in 2005 of $225.0 million under the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

The provision for income taxes presented for 2005 and 2004 has been reduced by approximately
$1.4 million and $3.4 million, respectively, due to the tax effect of the restatement for stock
compensation charges. See Note 2 for additional details.



Segment Information

A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. We began to track financial information by our three operating
segments during 2006 and 2005 as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the
business based on management operating income. We have included segment financial data for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 for comparative purposes.

Financial information for each operating segment used by management to make financial
decisions and allocate resources is as follows (in millions):

Infrastructure Operating Segment

Infrastructure segment net revenues increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to increases in
revenue from higher-end infrastructure chassis products and increased penetration by our core and
edge router portfolio as a result service providers acquiring products for their NGNs and
multi-play service offerings. In addition we believe there is increased demand for our products due
to the adoption and expansion of IP networks as a result of peer to peer interaction, increased
broadband usage, video, IPTV and an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical
business tool in the strategies of our IP customers, and of their enterprise customers.
Infrastructure segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 due to the adoption and expansion
of IP networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer
multiple services over a single network.

We track Infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends
and indicate areas of potential network growth. Our infrastructure product platforms are
essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a
certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules
or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of
data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium
and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on
the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number
of chassis on



which revenue was recognized during the period. The following table shows infrastructure
revenue units recognized and ports shipped:

Years Ended December 31,

10,211

9,977

7,102

Infrastructure ports shipped

160,318

153,763

115,255

Chassis revenue units increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to the sales of higher-end
T-series and M-series products and the inclusion of the chassis units related to a 2005
acquisition, partially offset by decreases in sales of lower-end E-series and M-series products.
Sales of higher-end chassis units increased as our customers continued to adopt and expand IP
networks in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a
single network. Port shipment units increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the increase in
port demands driven by the larger expansion capacity in the higher-end chassis revenue units
shipped during 2006, partially offset by the lower port capacity in CTP-series chassis revenue
units. Chassis revenue units increased from 2004 to 2005 due primarily to investment in new
broadband and other service provider networks during this time. Port shipment units increased from
2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth in subscribers and services utilizing the networks.

Infrastructure management operating income decreased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to higher
personnel related costs associated with our investments in product innovation for next generation
core and edge infrastructure products as well as increased operating expenses associated with
marketing related efforts and improvements to our internal infrastructure, partially offset by
savings in sales expense during 2006 as we increasingly leveraged our existing distribution
channel. Infrastructure management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to
increases in revenue as evident by the increase in chassis revenue units and the productivity
leverage such increase created. The increase was partially offset by higher personnel related costs
primarily related to support product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels.

SLT Operating Segment

The SLT operating segment consists of security products and application acceleration products.
The following table shows SLT revenue units recognized:

Years Ended December 31,




SLT revenue units

183,575

170,181

81,015

SLT net revenue increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily attributable to sales increases across
various SLT product families including firewalls/VPN, IDP, J-series, DX, and SSL/VPN. The full year
of inclusion of the DX and application acceleration products from the acquisitions completed in
2005 also contributed to the SLT revenue increases in 2006. Another part of the increase was driven
by cross selling our SLT products into service providers for internal use and managed services; and
a further part of the increase was due to successfully selling to much larger enterprise customers
with increased footprint and complexity.

SLT net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the NetScreen acquisition in
2004, and to a lesser extent, the Funk, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor acquisitions and increases in
the sales of firewall/VPN products in 2005.

SLT segment incurred a management operating loss in 2006, compared to the management operating
income in 2005, due primarily to higher product and personnel related costs despite the higher SLT
net revenues and gross margin. Increases in personnel related costs were primarily related to
headcount growth in order to support product innovation, new products sales and a larger customer
base. We have made a strategic decision to invest more into the enterprise and SLT markets to drive
increased revenues and SLT productivity in the future. SLT Management operating income increased
from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to increases in net revenue, partially offset by increased expenses
primarily related to product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels. Additionally, the
purchase accounting adjustments related to the NetScreen acquisition negatively impacted the
revenue and management operating results in 2004.

S

ervice Operating Segment

Net service revenues increased from 2005 to 2006 mainly due to the growth in support services,
and to a lesser extent, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support services was
largely due to increased technical support service contracts associated with higher product sales,
which have resulted in our growing installed base of equipment being serviced. The growth in
professional services was mainly due to resident engineering professional services and consulting
projects in 2006. Service gross margin percentages as well as Service management operating income
increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to improved economies of



scale achieved by faster revenue growth through the Infrastructure products and the SLT
products relative to the increases in operating costs. In absolute dollars, employee related
expenses increased in 2006 as a result of increased service related headcount from 476 to 611
individuals. Expenses associated with spare components also increased in 2006 to support increased
demands driven by additional service contracts as a result of our growing installed base.

Net service revenues increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth in support
services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support
services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base. Service
management operating income increased as a result of the revenue growth experienced in the
Infrastructure segment and the SLT segment, partially offset by increases in operating costs,
primarily due to personnel related costs. In absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased
as a result of increased headcount. Expenses associated with spares also increased as a result of
revenue growth.

Key Performance Measures

In addition to the financial metrics included in the consolidated financial statements, we use
the following key performance measure to assess operating results:

Years Ended December 31,




Days sales outstanding (DSO) (a)

Days sales outstanding, or DSO, is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts
receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90
days.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

We have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities. The
following table shows our capital resources (in millions):

As of December 31,



Working capital

618.3

Restricted cash

45.6

66.1

Working capital increased $497.8 million from 2005 to 2006 mainly due to cash provided by
operating activities and investing activities, partially offset by cash used in financing
activities. The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities
and deferred revenue.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash
equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and
from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee
stock purchase plan, will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments,
repurchases of our common stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing
operations through at least the next 12 months. However, it is possible that we may need to raise
additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next 12 months or to consummate acquisitions
of other businesses, assets, products or technologies. We could raise such funds by selling equity
or debt securities to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money from financial
institutions. In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell
additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons.

There are no transactions, arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated entities
or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of
our requirements for capital resources, except the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program approved
by the Board of Directors as described below. If we were to purchase $2.0 billion of our common
stock, we would significantly reduce our working capital and we may elect to obtain additional debt
or credit facilities to fund the repurchases.

Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many
factors, including:



Cash Requirements

In July 2006, our Board authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we are
authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Company’s common stock. In February 2007, our
Board approved an increase of $1.0 billion under this new share repurchase program. Coupled with
the original $1.0 billion approved in July 2006, we are now authorized to repurchase up to $2.0
billion of our common stock. Purchases under this plan will be subject to a review of the
circumstances in place at the time. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program will be made
from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be
discontinued at any time.

In May 2006, our audit committee commenced an independent review of our stock option practices
and related accounting. The audit committee was assisted by independent legal counsel and
accounting experts. We recognized $20.5 million of expense for legal and other professional
services associated with this stock option review through December 31, 2006. In addition, we
incurred tax related charges of $10.1 million in 2006. We expect to incur additional fees and other
costs in 2007.

(b)

Our principal commitment as of December 31, 2006 was our outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible
Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (“Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003 and
are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of



payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our
existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior
Notes bear no interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain
conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The
conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances. The carrying value of the Senior Notes as of December 31,
2006 was $399.9 million.

(c)

We do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. In order to reduce
manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers
place non-cancelable, non-returnable (“NCNR”) orders, which were valued at $120.5 million as
of December 31, 2006, based on our build forecasts. We do not take ownership of the components
and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with
the contract manufacturers. The components are used by the contract manufacturers to build
products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers. We do not incur a
liability for products built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customer’s
order and the order ships. However, if the components go unused, we may be assessed carrying
charges or obsolete charges. As of December 31, 2006, we had accrued $22.4 million based on
our estimate of such charges.

(d)

Other Contractual obligations consist of the following:

•

Escrow amount of $12.8 million related to the Funk acquisition to secure certain
indemnity obligations. One-half of the escrow expired in January 2007 and the remaining
one-half will expire in June 2007. Also included is a contingent bonus payable, based on
certain milestones, of $5.0 million, which was earned over a one year period ending in
2006.

•

Escrow amount of $1.6 million related to the Acorn acquisition to secure certain
indemnity obligations. The escrow period will expire in May 2007. Also included is a
contingent earn-out payable to former Acorn stockholders, based on certain milestones, of
up to $2.2 million, and a contingent bonus payable to employees related to continued
employment of up to $0.5 million. The earn-out and bonus amounts will be paid, to the
extent earned, in 2007 and 2008.

•

Escrow amount related to the Redline and Kagoor acquisitions of $0.7 million and
$5.1 million, respectively, to secure certain indemnity obligations.

There was 0.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $17.6 million,
established as of the acquisition date, were held in escrow to secure certain indemnity obligations
for the Peribit acquisition. Almost all of the escrow shares were distributed in February 2007 at
the then current market value of $19.15 per share, or an aggregate fair value of $14.1 million.

Summary of Cash Flows

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $755.6 million, $642.9 million and $439.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The cash provided by
operating activities for each period was due to our net income (loss) adjusted by:

§

Non-cash charges of $1,536.4 million, $307.4 million, and $254.0 million for 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively, primarily related to depreciation and amortization expenses,
stock-based compensation, tax benefit of employee stock option plans, in-process research
and development from acquisitions, debt issuance costs, loss on disposal of property and
equipment, restructuring expense, and impairment charges. Non-cash charges in 2006
included a $1,283.4 million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. In 2005 and
2004, non-cash charges included $128.1 million and $62.6 million of tax benefit from
employee stock options while tax benefit from employee stock options which in accordance
with SFAS 123R are no longer included in cash flows from operations beginning in 2006 but
rather are included in financing activities. In 2006, tax benefits from tax deductions in
excess of the stock-based compensation expense recognized was presented as a financing
activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of 2006. Non-cash charges in 2005
also included a benefit from the reversal of NetScreen’s acquisition related liabilities
and a loss due to the impairment of an equity investment, partially offset by gains
associated with available-for-sale investments. In 2004, non-cash charges also included a
loss from the redemption of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and a loss due to the
write-down of equity investments.

§

Net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $220.6 million, $(15.1) million, and
$57.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were in the normal course of
business. These changes are highlighted as follows:



§

Net cash increases in 2006 are primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue
of $132.8 million due to the growing installed base and customer payments in advance of
product acceptance. The increase in operating cash flows was also due to the decreases in
accounts receivable of $20.7 million and aggregate decreases in prepaid expenses, other
current assets and other long-term assets of $23.0 million. Accounts payable increased
$13.6 million and accrued compensation increased $12.7 million primarily due to the costs
of headcount increases and related employee bonuses. Changes in taxes payable and other
accrued liabilities contributed $18.3 million to cash flows from operations in 2006.

§

Net cash used during the year ended December 31, 2005 from changes in account balances
was primarily attributable to increases in net accounts receivable of $68.1 million and
decreases in other accrued liabilities of $100.7 million and accrued warranty of $3.7
million. Decreases in the prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long-term assets
accounts of $5.3 million, the increases in income taxes payable of $26.6 million, deferred
revenue of $64.3 million, accounts payable of $50.3 million and accrued compensation of
$10.9 million contributed positively to cash flows from operations.

§

Net cash provided during the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to
increases in deferred revenue of $93.6 million due to increases in the Company’s installed
base. Increases in accrued compensation of $40.3 million, accounts payable of $29.4
million, income taxes payable of $16.9 million, other accrued liabilities of $11.0 million
and accrued warranty of $3.6 million contributed to operating cash flows. These amounts
were partially offset by increases in net accounts receivable of $81.4 million and prepaid
expenses, other current assets, and other long-term assets of $56.3 million.

Investing Activities

Net cash provided in investing activities was $11.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2006. Net cash used in investing activities was $583.7 million and $58.5 million for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investing activities included capital expenditures
and the purchases and sale or maturities of available-for-sale securities, the purchase and sale of
equity investments, and the acquisitions of businesses.

Capital expenditures increased $3.9 million to $102.1 million in 2006 and increased $35.0
million to $98.2 million in 2005 mainly due to new product developments and overseas expansions,
and business acquisitions. Positive net cash flows of $115.9 million generated from the sales and
purchases of available-for-sale securities in 2006 was primarily due to higher short-term interest
rates. Purchases and sales of available-for-sale securities used $131.0 million and $34.7 million
in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other investing activities include:

§

$15.1 million of cash was used in the acquisitions during 2005, $20.5 million of cash
was provided by the decrease of restricted cash, and $7.3 million of minority equity
investment during 2006; $15.1 million of cash used in acquisition was due to the escrow
payments related to the 2005 acquisitions. Restricted cash decreased by $20.5 million in
2006 primarily due to the $15.1 million escrow payments associated with the 2005
acquisitions. Another contributing factor to the decrease in restricted cash in 2006 was
the reduction in deposit requirements of $5.9 million pertaining to letters of credit for
facility leases;

§

$309.9 million of cash used in the 2005 acquisitions, $34.8 million of restricted cash
funded to escrow accounts in relation to the 2005 acquisitions, and $9.8 million of
minority equity investment during 2005; and

§

$40.9 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the NetScreen
acquisition during 2004.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Net cash provided in financing activities was $146.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Net cash used in financing activities was $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash
was provided during all periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option
exercises and stock purchase plans. In 2006, we repurchased 10,071,000 shares of our common stock
at an average price of $18.51 per share, or a total of $186.4 million. Common stock issued in
relation to employee stock option exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated total cash
proceeds of $87.1 million during the 2006 period. Beginning in 2006, SFAS 123R requires excess tax
benefits relating to exercises of employee options to be included in financing activities. In 2006,
total tax benefits of $9.7 million from tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for
employee stock options was presented as financing cash flows due to the adoption of SFAS 123R
beginning on January 1, 2006. Tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock
options were previously included in operating cash flows prior to 2006. In 2005, common stock
issued in relation to employee option exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated total
cash proceeds of $146.0 million. In 2004, common stock issued in



relation to employee option exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated total cash
proceeds of $175.2 million. During 2004, we spent $145.0 million to retire our Subordinated Notes
and $63.6 million to retire 2.9 million shares of our common stock. The repurchase of our common
stock did not have a material impact on our liquidity.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

(“FIN 48”)

.

FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related
to income taxes subject to FASB Statement 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

including uncertain tax
positions. Under FIN 48 a company will recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is
more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical
merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits
from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the
de-recognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and
disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. FIN
48 also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and
how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the
balance sheet. Differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position
prior to and after the adoption of FIN 48 would be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment
to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are required to adopt FIN 48 as of January 1,
2007. Upon adoption, there is a possibility that the cumulative effect would result in an
adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. In addition, the application of FIN 48
may increase our future effective tax rates and its future intra-period effective tax rate
volatility. We are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of FIN 48 on our consolidated
financial statements and are not yet in a position to determine such effects.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement (“SFAS”) No. 157,

Fair Value Measurement,

(“SFAS 157”)

.

SFAS 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and
liabilities. The guidance clarifies the principle for assessing fair value based on the assumptions
market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In support of this principle,
the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop
those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active
markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data such as companies’ own data. Under this
guidance, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value
hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating SFAS
157 and expect to adopt this guidance beginning on January 1, 2008.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These
securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value
of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact on
interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate
exposures.

These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The
modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes
in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve
of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the
historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate.

Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

It is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in
foreign currencies. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated
by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These derivatives are
carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense). Changes in the fair value of
these derivatives are largely offset by re-measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months.

Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and/or option contracts to hedge certain
forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are
designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of
the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently
reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged
transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial
during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, in other income (expense) in our results
of operations.



ITEM 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Juniper Networks Inc.’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over the company’s financial reporting. We assessed the effectiveness of the
company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this
assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment using those criteria, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2006,
Juniper Networks Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Juniper Networks Inc.’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP,
audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and have issued an
audit report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting.
This report appears on page 60 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Please note that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal
control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect
to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of
internal control may vary over time.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Juniper Networks, Inc. as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005 (restated), and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006 (restated). Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Juniper Networks, Inc. at December 31, 2006 and
2005 (restated), and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 (restated), in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” the Company has restated
previously issued financial statements as of December 31, 2005 and for each of the years in the two
year period ended December 31, 2005.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective January 1, 2006, the
Company adopted the provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004),

Share-Based Payment

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Juniper Networks, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated March 6, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Juniper Networks, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Juniper Networks, Inc. as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005 (restated), and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006 (restated), and our report dated March 6, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of Business

Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks” or the “Company”) was founded in 1996 to develop
and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of service providers. Today the
Company designs and sells products and services that together provide its customers with secured
and assured Internet Protocol (“IP”) secure networking solutions. The Company’s solutions are
incorporated into the global web of interconnected public and private networks across which a
variety of media, including voice, video and data, travel to and from end users around the world.
The Company’s network infrastructure solutions enable service providers and other network-intensive
businesses to support and deliver services and applications on a highly efficient and low cost
integrated network. The Company’s Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”) solutions meet a broad array
of its customer’s priorities, from protecting the network itself, and protecting data on the
network, to maximizing existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications across a distributed
network. Together, the Company’s secure networking solutions enable its customers to convert
networks that provide commoditized, best efforts services into more valuable assets that provide
differentiation and value and increased reliability and security to end users. The Company sells
and markets its products through its direct sales organization, value-added resellers and
distributors.

In 2005 the Company completed the acquisitions of Funk Software, Inc. (“Funk”), Acorn Packet
Solutions, Inc. (“Acorn”), Peribit Networks, Inc. (“Peribit”), Redline Networks, Inc (“Redline”),
and Kagoor Networks, Inc. (“Kagoor”). In 2004 the Company completed its acquisition of NetScreen
Technologies, Inc. (“NetScreen”). As a result of the these acquisitions, the Company expanded its
customer base and portfolio of products, and now offers two categories of networking products:
infrastructure products, which consist predominately of the original Juniper Networks router
portfolio, and acquired Kagoor and Acorn products, and SLT products, which consist predominately of
the former Funk, Peribit, Redline, and NetScreen products.

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying notes. Estimates are used for revenue recognition, allowance for sales returns,
allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for contract manufacturer obligations, allowance for
warranty costs, goodwill and other impairments, income taxes, litigation and settlement costs, and
other loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and also on
assumptions that it believes are standard and reasonable. Actual results experienced by the Company
may differ materially from management’s estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are
classified as cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand,
balances with banks, and highly liquid investments in money market funds, commercial paper,
government securities, certificates of deposit, and corporate debt securities.

Investments

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and
reevaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date. Realized gains and losses and
declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific
identification method and are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company’s
investments in publicly traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale investments are initially recorded at cost and periodically adjusted to fair
value through comprehensive income.



Equity Investments

Juniper Networks has investments in privately held companies. These investments are included
in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are carried at cost, adjusted for
any impairment, as the Company does not have a controlling interest and does not have the ability
to exercise significant influence over these companies. These investments are inherently high risk
as the market for technologies or products manufactured by these companies are usually early stage
at the time of the investment by Juniper Networks and such markets may never be significant. The
Company monitors these investments for impairment by considering financial, operational and
economic data and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accrued compensation, and other accrued liabilities, approximates fair market
value due to the relatively short period of time to maturity. The fair value of investments is
determined using quoted market prices for those securities or similar financial instruments.

Concentrations

Financial instruments that subject Juniper Networks to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. Juniper Networks
maintains its cash and cash equivalents and investments in fixed income securities with
high-quality institutions and only invests in high quality credit instruments. Deposits held with
banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may
be redeemed upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk.

Generally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due to the number of
entities comprising the Company’s customer base and their dispersion across different geographic
locations throughout the world. Juniper Networks performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. Juniper Networks
maintains reserves for potential credit losses and historically such losses have been within
management’s expectations. One customer accounted for 14%, 14% and 15% of total net revenues during
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company relies on sole suppliers for certain of its components such as
application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”) and custom sheet metal. Additionally, Juniper
Networks relies primarily on two significant independent contract manufacturers for the production
of all of its products. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to fulfill supply
requirements of Juniper Networks could negatively impact future operating results.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life, generally
three to five years, or the lease term of the respective assets. Land is not subject to
depreciation.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible
and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets resulting
from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are
estimated by management based on the fair value of assets received. Identifiable intangible assets
are comprised of purchased trademarks, developed technologies, customer and maintenance contracts,
and other intangible assets. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to annual
assessment, at a minimum, for impairment by applying a fair-value based test. Future goodwill
impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. Purchased intangibles with finite lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from two to
twelve years.

Impairment

The Company evaluates long-lived assets held-for-use for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is
considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected
to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured
by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. The Company
assesses the recoverability of its



long-lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be
recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of
impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows.

The Company evaluates goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events and
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s
carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the
reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach
and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is
performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. As discussed in Note 4, in the
second quarter of 2006 the Company concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired and
recorded an impairment charge. After recording the impairment charge, Juniper Networks conducted
its annual impairment test as of November 1, 2006 and determined that the carrying value of the
remaining goodwill was not impaired. There were no events or circumstances from that date through
December 31, 2006 that would impact this assessment. Future impairment indicators, including
further declines in the Company’s market capitalization or a decrease in revenue or profitability
levels, could require additional impairment charges to be recorded.

Revenue Recognition

Juniper Networks sells products and services through its direct sales force and through its
strategic distribution relationships and value-added resellers. The Company’s products are
integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment. Additionally, the
Company provides unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to the integrated software through
its maintenance contracts for most of its products. Accordingly, the Company accounts for revenue
in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, and all related
interpretations. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility
is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders
and, in certain instances, sales contracts or agreements. Shipping terms and related documents, or
written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery or
performance. In instances where final acceptance of the product, system or solution is specified by
the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. The Company assesses
whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price
is subject to refund or adjustment. Collectibility is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the
customer as determined by credit checks and the customer’s payment history to the Company. Accounts
receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns and
pricing credits.

For arrangements with multiple elements, the Company allocates revenue to each element using
the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered
items. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the
total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements. Vendor
specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold
separately.

For sales to direct end-users and value-added resellers, the Company recognizes product
revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. For the
end-users and value-added resellers, the Company has no significant obligations for future
performance such as rights of return or pricing credits. A portion of the Company’s sales are made
through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and/or rights of return. Product
revenue on sales made through these distributors is recognized upon sell-through as reported by the
distributors to the Company. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of
distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon
sell–through

Sales and transfers of financial instruments are accounted for under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities

(“SFAS 140”). The Company sells interests in accounts receivables as
part of a distributor accounts receivable financing arrangement which was established by the
Company with a major financing company. Receivables sold under such arrangements are removed from
the balance sheet and the related transaction fees are recorded in the statement of operations at
the time they are sold in accordance with SFAS 140. Specifically, the receivables are legally
isolated from the Company, the purchasers have the right to pledge or exchange the receivables and
the purchasers obtain effective control over the receivables.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing
adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is
recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection
credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time.



Shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping
costs are included in cost of product revenues. Costs associated with cooperative advertising
programs are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time the related sales are
recognized.

Services include maintenance, training and professional services. In addition to providing
unspecified upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis, the Company’s maintenance
contracts includes 24-hour technical support, and hardware repair and replacement parts.
Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts. Revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred
and recognized ratably over the contractual support period, generally one year. Revenue from
training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the
contractual period.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectibility
of customer accounts. Juniper Networks regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such
as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances and current
economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.

Warranties

Juniper Networks generally offers a one-year warranty on all of its hardware products and a
90-day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. The warranty
generally includes parts and labor obtained through the Company’s 24-hour service center. On
occasion, the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary. The Company accrues for
warranty costs based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under its warranty obligations,
including material costs, technical support labor costs and associated overhead. The warranty
accrual is included in the Company’s cost of revenues and is recorded at the time revenue is
recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number of installed
units, its estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims, costs per claim and estimated support
labor costs and the associated overhead. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of our
recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

Contract Manufacturer Liabilities

The Company outsources most of its manufacturing, repair and supply chain management
operations to its independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of its cost of
revenues consists of payments to them. Its independent contract manufacturers procure components
and manufacture the Company’s products based on the Company’s demand forecasts. These forecasts are
based on the Company’s estimates of future demand for the Company products, which are in turn based
on historical trends and an analysis from the Company’s sales and marketing organizations, adjusted
for overall market conditions. The Company establishes accrued liabilities, included in other
current accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, for carrying charges
and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends.

Research and Development

Costs to research, design, and develop the Company’s products are expensed as incurred.
Software development costs are capitalized beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has
been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers.
Generally, Juniper Networks’ products are released soon after technological feasibility has been
established. As a result, costs subsequent to achieving technological feasibility have not been
significant and all software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. Advertising expense
was $6.8 million, $6.6 million, and $7.9 million, for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Litigation and Settlement Costs

From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions.
The Company records a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss
contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to
issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired
or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss
can be reasonably estimated. However the actual liability
in any such litigation may be materially different from the Company’s estimates, which could
result in the need to record additional expenses.



Loss Contingencies

The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the
ordinary course of business. It considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the
incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in
determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that
an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to its
management to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are
required.

Stock-Based Compensation

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, (“SFAS 123R”) which requires the measurement and recognition
of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors including
employee stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and purchases under the Company’s Employee
Stock Purchase Plan based on estimated fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes the previous accounting
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB
25”), as allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”), for periods beginning in 2006. In March 2005, the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”) relating to
SFAS 123R. The Company has applied the provisions of SAB 107 in conjunction with its adoption of
SFAS 123R.

The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires
the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, the first day of the Company’s
fiscal year 2006. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective
transition method, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for periods prior to 2006 have
not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123R.

SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of
grant using an option-pricing model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model
to determine the fair value of stock options under SFAS 123R, consistent with that used for pro
forma disclosures under SFAS 123. The fair value of an RSU is equivalent to the market price of the
Company’s common stock on the grant date. The value of the portion of the stock-based award that is
ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods, or in the
period of grant if the requisite service period has been provided, in the Company’s Consolidated
Statement of Operations.

Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 included (i) compensation expense for stock-based
awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December 31, 2005 based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 and (ii) compensation expense for the
stock-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS
123R, the Company changed its accounting policy of attributing the fair value of stock-based
compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple-option approach provided by APB 25, as
allowed under SFAS 123, to the straight-line single-option approach, as allowed under SFAS 123R.
Compensation expense for all expected-to-vest stock-based awards that were granted on or prior to
December 31, 2005 will continue to be recognized using the accelerated attribution method.
Compensation expense for all expected-to-vest stock-based awards that were granted or modified
subsequent to December 31, 2005 is recognized on a straight-line basis provided that the amount of
compensation cost recognized at any date is no less than the portion of the grant-date value of the
award that is vested at that date. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of
grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. In the Company’s stock-based compensation expense required under APB 25 and the pro
forma information required under SFAS 123 for the periods prior to 2006, the Company accounted for
forfeitures as they occurred.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations under the provisions of APB 25. In accordance with
APB 25, no compensation expense was required for the employee stock purchases under the Company’s
Employee Stock Purchase Plan under APB 25. Stock-based compensation expense of $22.3 million and
$54.9 million for the years ended 2005 and 2004, respectively, was related to employee stock-based
awards and stock options assumed from acquisitions. As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, stock-based
compensation expense recorded for 2006 was $87.6 million, or $74.4 million higher than which would
have been reported had the Company continued to account for stock-based



compensation under APB 25. Net income for 2006 was approximately $51.4 million lower than that
which would have been reported had the Company continued to account for stock-based compensation
under APB 25. Unamortized deferred compensation associated with stock options assumed from past
acquisitions and employee stock-based awards of $17.7 million has been reclassified to additional
paid-in capital in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet upon the adoption of SFAS 123R on
January 1, 2006. Additional information is discussed in Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated
Financial Statements,” and Note 10, “Stockholders’ Equity.”

In accordance with SFAS 123R, the Company has presented as financing cash flows the tax
benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those
options beginning in 2006. Tax benefits from employee stock plans of $9.7 million, which related to
tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized, were presented as financing cash
flows for 2006. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, tax benefits from employee stock plans were
presented as operating cash flows. Additionally, In accordance with SFAS 123R, SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”), and EITF Topic D-32, “Intra-period Tax Allocation of
the Effect of Pretax Income from Continuing Operations,” the Company has elected to recognize
excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid-in capital only if an
incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes
presently available to the Company.

The following table summarizes the pro forma net income and earnings per share, net of related
tax effect, had the Company applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to employee
stock benefits (in millions, except per share amounts):

Derivatives

It is the Company’s policy to use derivatives to partially offset its market exposure to
fluctuations in foreign currencies. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or
trading purposes. Juniper Networks uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction
gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense).
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re-measurement of the
underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities between
one and two months.

Periodically, the Company uses foreign currency forward and/or option contracts to hedge
certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives
are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion
of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently
reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged
transaction relates. The Company records any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was
immaterial during 2006, 2005 and 2004 in other income (expense) on its Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Provision for Income Taxes

Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the
determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary
differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently
enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
are expected to be realized or settled. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its
deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or



recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS
109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes,”

and records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax
assets to the amount that it believes to be more likely than not realizable. The Company believes
it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax
liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event
that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future,
an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such
determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that
were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be
reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period
such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of its tax liabilities involves dealing
with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes potential
liabilities based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be
due.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from non-owner
sources. The Company has presented its comprehensive income as part of the Consolidated Statements
of Stockholders’ Equity. Other comprehensive income includes net unrealized losses on
available-for-sale securities and net foreign currency translation gains (losses) that are excluded
from net income.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations with non-U.S. dollar functional currency are
translated to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and
expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. Foreign
currency translation gains and losses were not material for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies were
immaterial in the years presented.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

(“FIN 48”)

.

FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related
to income taxes subject to SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

including uncertain tax
positions. Under FIN 48 a company will recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is
more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical
merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits
from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the
de-recognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and
disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. FIN
48 also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and
how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the
balance sheet. Differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position
prior to and after the adoption of FIN 48 would be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment
to the beginning balance of retained earnings. Upon adoption, there is a possibility that the
cumulative effect would result in an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. In
addition, the application of FIN 48 may increase the Company’s future effective tax rates and its
future intra-period effective tax rate volatility. The Company is required to adopt FIN 48 as of
January 1, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of FIN 48 on its
consolidated financial statements and is not yet in a position to determine such effects.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement (“SFAS”) No. 157,

Fair Value Measurement,

(“SFAS 157”)

.

SFAS 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and
liabilities. The guidance clarifies the principle for assessing fair value based on the assumptions
market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In support of this principle,
the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop
those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active
markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data such as companies’ own data. Under this
guidance, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value
hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
evaluating SFAS 157 and expects to adopt this guidance beginning on January 1, 2008.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances in order to conform to the
current year’s presentation.



Note 2. Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements

In this Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 (the “2006 Form 10-K”),
Juniper Networks is restating its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 as a result of an independent stock option
investigation commenced by our Board of Directors and Audit Committee. This 2006 Form 10-K will
also reflect the restatement of “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” in Item 6 for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In addition, the Company is restating the
unaudited quarterly financial information and financial statements for interim periods of 2005, and
unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006.

Financial information included in the reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed by
Juniper Networks prior to August 10, 2006, and the related opinions of its independent registered
public accounting firm, and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued by the
Company, prior to August 10, 2006 should not be relied upon and are superseded in their entirety by
this Report and other reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on or
after August 10, 2006.

Stock Option Investigation

On May 22, 2006, the Company issued a press release and Form 8-K announcing that it had
received a request for information relating to the Company’s stock option granting practices from
the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. In the same press release and Form
8-K, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) had directed the Board’s Audit
Committee, comprised of outside directors, to conduct a review of the Company’s stock option
granting practices. On May 24, 2006, Company counsel received a letter from the SEC indicating that
the SEC was conducting an inquiry regarding Juniper Networks.

The investigation was conducted with the assistance of independent counsel and forensic
accountants (collectively the “Investigative Team”). The investigation focused on all stock option
grants made to all employees, officers, directors and consultants during the period following the
Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) on June 24, 1999 to May 23, 2006 (the “relevant period”).
In addition, the Audit Committee investigation involved testing and analyses of the Company’s
hiring, termination, leave of absence, grant notification and exercise practices regarding stock
options and certain issues regarding grants made before the IPO. The scope of the investigation did
not include a review of options granted by companies acquired by Juniper Networks. All of the
companies acquired by Juniper Networks, with one exception, were privately held companies. None of
the acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of interests. All of the acquisitions were
accounted for under the purchase method as provided by Statement of Financial Standards No. 141,

Business Combinations

and its predecessor Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16,

Business
Combinations.

Consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC, the Company
organized the grants during the relevant period into categories based on grant type and the process
by which the grant was finalized. The Company analyzed the evidence from the Audit Committee’s
investigation related to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents,
electronic documents, underlying electronic data about documents, and witness interviews. Based on
the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company applied the then appropriate accounting standards
to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement
date is not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required,
resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects.

Grants made by the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee to Officers or Directors

The Company has concluded that the measurement dates of several grants to executive officers
who were “reporting persons” as that term is defined under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, (“Officers”) and members of the Board of Directors made between June 1999
and June 2003 were incorrect. In general, during the relevant period, the Board or the Compensation
Committee of the Board made grants to Officers and directors. Grants were sometimes approved at
meetings of these bodies or by action by unanimous written consent. There were several instances in
which grants to Officers or directors were given grant dates (and corresponding exercise prices)
prior to the date on which formal corporate action making the grant was taken. In general, this
appears to have been done to make the grant date coincide with either a specific event, such as the
appointment or re-election of a director or with the purported date options were granted to
non-Officers. In these cases, the Company has determined that the correct measurement date is the
date on which the Board or Compensation Committee took the action to approve the grant. The Company
also identified instances in which grants to Officers were granted effective upon a future event,
such as the commencement of employment or closing of an acquisition. In these cases, the Company
has determined that the date of the future event is the correct measurement date for such grants.
In connection with the application of these measurement principles, and after accounting for



forfeitures, the Company has adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options
covering 5.6 million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock-based compensation
expense of $80.3 million on a pre-tax basis over the respective awards’ vesting terms. Juniper
Network’s CEO, Scott Kriens, received two stock option awards whose measurement dates for financial
accounting purposes differ from the recorded grant dates for such awards. However, both options
were exchanged and cancelled unexercised in 2001 as part of a company-wide option re-pricing
program. Mr. Kriens has not exercised any stock options since 1998, approximately nine months
before the Company’s IPO.

In addition, there was one other grant to an Officer where approval of such grant was not
reflected in minutes of a meeting or an action by unanimous written consent of the Board of
Directors or the Compensation Committee. For this grant, the measurement date was determined based
on the terms of the Officer’s offer letter and the date his employment commenced. With respect to
that grant, the Company has adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 1.5
million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock-based compensation expense of $6.5
million on a pre-tax basis over the award’s vesting terms after accounting for forfeitures.

Grants to Non-Officers

The Company has concluded that the measurement dates of a large number of grants to
non-Officers during the period between June 1999 and December 2004 were incorrect. The Company’s
practice has been to grant stock options, except where prohibited, to nearly all full-time
employees in connection with joining the Company. To facilitate the granting of options to Juniper
Networks’ rapidly growing workforce, the Board of Directors established a Stock Option Committee to
grant options to non-Officer employees. Between June 1999 and June 2003, the dates for a large
number of grants made by the Stock Option Committee were chosen with the benefit of hindsight as to
the price of the Company’s stock, so as to give favorable exercise prices. Moreover, the Stock
Option Committee’s process for finalizing and documenting these grants was often completed after
the originally assigned grant date. Beginning with grants dated June 20, 2003, the Company
implemented a number of new procedures and policies regarding the granting of options to
non-Officer employees. After that, the pattern of consciously looking back for the most favorable
dates for the employees ceased. However, the documentation and written approvals of grant dates
still generally trailed the recorded grant dates. Based on all available facts and circumstances,
the originally recorded measurement dates for the grants made by the Stock Option Committee during
the period from July 1999 through December 2004 can not be relied upon in isolation as the correct
measurement dates. In 2005, the Company made additional changes to its procedures. No grants in
2005 and 2006 required new measurement dates.

APB 25 defines the measurement date for determining stock-based compensation expense as the
first date on which both (1) the number of shares that an individual employee is entitled to
receive and (2) the option or purchase price, are known. Throughout the relevant period, the
Company’s stock administration department entered the option grant information for grants made by
the Stock Option Committee into its Equity Edge stock administration system. This system was used
to monitor and administer the Company’s stock option program. The data in Equity Edge were sent on
a regular basis to designated brokers, allowing grantees to view their options information in their
accounts via the Internet.

For grants made by the Stock Option Committee between June 1999 and December 2004, where there
is no other reliable objective evidence pointing to an earlier single specific date that the number
of shares and the individuals entitled to receive them and the price had become final, the Company
has determined the Equity Edge entry date to be the most reliable measurement date for calculating
additional stock-based compensation expense under APB 25. Using this measurement date, and after
accounting for forfeitures, the Company has adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for
options covering 74.2 million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock-based
compensation expense of $636.7 million on a pre-tax basis over the respective awards’ vesting
terms.

In many of the cases where the Equity Edge entry date was used as the measurement date, the
formal Stock Option Committee granting documentation (consisting of unanimous written consents or
minutes and related lists of recipients, amounts and types of awards) was not created or completed
until a later date. Because the awards listed in the formal granting documentation did not differ
from the grants entered into Equity Edge, the notice of the awards was made available to employees
prior to the creation or completion of the granting documents, and because the completion of the
documentation was treated as perfunctory, the Company determined that the Equity Edge entry date
was the proper measurement date under APB 25 rather than the date the Stock Option Committee
granting documentation was completed.

In a number of cases, there was reliable objective evidence pointing to a single specific date
that the number of shares and the individuals entitled to receive them and the price had become
final. Such evidence primarily consisted of electronic data indicating that the granting instrument
and schedule were created prior to the Equity Edge entry date. The Company also relied on other
evidence such as emails or written agreements to determine the date certain options became final.
Such evidence was used to determine the measurement dates for options for which the Company has
adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 27.9



million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock-based compensation expense of
$141.2 million on a pre-tax basis over the respective awards’ vesting terms.

The Company also concluded that there were instances in which clerical errors or omissions
regarding the persons to receive an award or the number of options to be granted were corrected
after the date of award. In the case of most additions made to correct omissions and other
corrections that were not reflected on the grant documentation at the time of the applicable grant
date or in documentation existing at the time of grant, the Company has determined that a new
measurement date should be established. The Company considered whether certain of such changes or
additions should give rise to variable accounting treatment and concluded that such treatment was
not appropriate because the grants represented independent decisions or events rather than a
continuation or modification of the other grants. The Company believes that the correct measurement
date for these grants is the date Stock Administration entered the correction or addition into
Equity Edge, except where objective evidence identifies an earlier date on which the correction was
approved. After accounting for forfeitures, the Company has adjusted the measurement of
compensation cost for options covering 1.3 million shares of common stock resulting in an
incremental stock-based compensation of $11.9 million on a pre-tax basis over the respective
awards’ vesting terms.

Stock Option Grant Modifications Connected with Terminations or Leaves of Absences and Other
Matters

Compensation expense was also recognized as a result of modifications that were made to
certain employee option grant awards in connection with certain employees’ terminations or leaves
of absence. Typically such modifications related to extensions of the time employees could exercise
options following their termination of employment or that enabled the employee to vest in
additional shares in relation to a leave of absence. For example, in connection with reductions in
work force in 2001 and 2002, the Company increased the period for affected employees to exercise
their options from 30 days to 90 days. The Company has incremental stock-based compensation expense
associated with such terminations or leaves of absence of $20.0 million on a pre-tax basis in the
period of modification.

Compensation expense of $0.2 million on a pre-tax basis was also recognized as a result of
non-employee grants to consultants in exchange for services and other matters.

Judgment

In light of the significant judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates, alternate
approaches to those used by the Company could have resulted in different compensation expense
charges than those recorded in the restatement. The Company considered various alternative
approaches. For example, in those cases where the formal documentation of a grant was completed
after the date the grant was entered in Equity Edge, an alternative measurement date to using the
Equity Edge entry date could be the creation date of the documentation. The Company believes that
the approaches used by it were the most appropriate under the circumstances.

Summary of Stock-Based Compensation Adjustments

The Company adjusted the measurement dates for options covering a total of 110.5 million, or
76%, of the 146.0 million shares of common stock covered by options granted during the relevant
period.

The incremental impact on the consolidated statement of operations from recognizing
stock-based compensation expense through December 31, 2006 resulting from the investigation is as
follows (in millions):

In addition to the $894.7 million recognized through fiscal 2005, $2.1 million of
unamortized deferred compensation remained as of December 31, 2005, bringing the total incremental
impact from the investigation to approximately $896.8 million. As required by SFAS 123R which was
adopted on January 1, 2006, the unamortized deferred compensation of $2.1 million has been
reclassified to additional paid-in capital, along with the unamortized deferred compensation for
stock options assumed from past acquisitions, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
Beginning in 2006, the incremental amortization resulting from the investigation is included in
stock-based compensation expense under the provisions of SFAS 123R. The incremental pre-tax stock
compensation expense from the restatement of employee stock options was $0.6 million, on a pre-tax
basis, for the year ended December 31, 2006 and was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Additionally, the Company has restated the pro forma amortization of deferred stock
compensation included in reported net income, net of tax, and total stock-based employee
compensation expenses determined under fair value based method, net of tax, under SFAS 123 in Note
1 to reflect the impact of the stock-based compensation expense resulting from the correction of
these past stock options grants. The Company also determined that the previously reported pro forma
compensation expense for options assumed in a 2004 acquisition was inadvertently based on an
incorrect fair value. The amount of pro forma stock-based compensation expense reported in the
table below has been revised to reflect the proper fair value for options assumed from the 2004
acquisition. Such adjustment was previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The following table presents the effect of the related adjustments on the pro forma
calculation of the net income and income per share for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively (in millions, except per share amounts):

Other Matters

After considering all available evidence, primarily the then current 2005 operating
projections of future income, which remain appropriate, management has concluded that the
previously recorded valuation allowance related to the tax benefit of stock options deductions
should have been reversed in the fourth quarter of 2005. Accordingly, the Company decreased the
valuation allowance as of December 31, 2005 by $158.0 million with a corresponding credit to
additional paid in capital. The remaining valuation allowance balance of $40.6 million relates to
capital losses that will carry forward to offset future capital gains.

Additionally, the Company misclassified the tax benefit from deductions from stock options
assumed in acquisitions. Accordingly, the Company has reduced additional paid-in capital for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 by $6.0 million and $18.5 million, respectively, with a
corresponding decrease to goodwill. The total reduction to both additional paid-in capital and
goodwill as of December 31, 2005 was $24.5 million.

Because virtually all holders of options issued by the Company were not involved in or aware
of the incorrect pricing, the Company has taken and intends to take actions to deal with certain
adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of certain incorrectly priced options.
The primary adverse tax consequences are that incorrectly priced stock options vesting after
December 31, 2004 may subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A (and, as
applicable, similar penalty taxes under California and other state tax laws). The Company recorded
a $10.1 million as other charges in operating expense for 2006 in relation to these items and other
tax related items. The Company expects to incur future charges to resolve the adverse tax
consequences of incorrectly priced options



The Company misclassified the losses from the retirement of its treasury shares in fiscal
2004. Accordingly, the Company reduced its retained earnings (accumulated deficit) as of December
31, 2005 and 2004 by $63.6 million with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.

The total purchase price for certain acquisitions could increase upon the release of the
amounts held in escrow for indemnity obligations and upon additional contingent payments.

Allocation of Initial Purchase Consideration

The Company allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, including IPR&D, based on their fair values. The excess purchase price over
those fair values is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is subject to change due to the release of the
amounts held in escrow for indemnity obligations, additional contingent payments, and changes in
acquisition related assets and liabilities. The fair values assigned to intangible assets acquired
were based on valuations prepared by independent third party appraisal firms using estimates and
assumptions provided by management. A summary of the purchase price allocations for each
acquisition is as follows (in millions):

Existing technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility and
includes products in the acquired product lines. Existing technology was valued using the
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. This method calculates the value of the



intangible asset as being the present value of the after tax cash flows potentially
attributable to it, net of the return on fair value attributable to tangible and other intangible
assets.

Maintenance agreements represent the revenue generated by contracts with customers who pay for
annual maintenance and support. The income approach was used to estimate the fair value of the
maintenance agreements, which includes estimating the ongoing, after-tax income expected from
maintenance agreements in place at the time of each acquisition, including expected renewals.

Patents and core technology represent a combination of processes, patents, and trade secrets
that were used for existing and in-process technology. The value of the trade name and trademarks
is represented by the benefit of owning these intangible assets rather than paying royalties for
their use. Both of these intangible assets were valued using the royalty savings method. This
method estimates the value of these intangible assets by capitalizing the royalties saved because
the Company owns the assets.

Relationships with customers represent the rights granted to the VAR or distributor to resell
certain products. The VAR and distributor relationships were valued using the avoided cost method,
which takes into account the cost of establishing each relationship.

2006 Acquisitions

Pro forma results of operations are not presented for the 2006 acquisitions as there were no
acquisitions in 2006.

2005 Acquisitions

Pro forma results of operations are not presented for the 2005 acquisitions as the effects of
these acquisitions are not material to Juniper Networks on either an individual or an aggregate
annual basis.

Funk Acquisition:

On December 1, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Funk. Funk, a
leading provider of standards-based network access security solutions, developed products and
technologies that protect the integrity of the network by ensuring both the user and the device
meet an organization’s security policies before granting access. The purchase price for Funk
included a cash payment of $110.2 million. Currently excluded from the aggregate purchase price of
$111.3 million is a balance of $12.2 million held in escrow for indemnity obligations, of which
one-half will expire in January 2007 and the remaining one-half in June 2007. In addition, the
Company paid $4.8 million upon achieving certain agreed-upon conditions in January 2007. Contingent
payments associated with future employment conditions were recorded as compensation expense ratably
over the 13 month period from the acquisition date.

Acorn Acquisition:

On October 20, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Acorn.
Acorn’s products and technologies provide a smooth migration path of more flexible and
cost-effective by connecting legacy Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and other circuit-based
applications across next-generation IP networks. The purchase price for Acorn included a cash
payment of $4.0 million. Currently excluded from the aggregate purchase price of $4.3 million is a
balance of $1.5 million held in escrow for indemnity obligations, which will expire on May 30,
2007. Depending on the contingency, any additional payments will be recorded as either compensation
expense or additional purchase price. In addition, the Company paid $1.1 million in January 2007 in
connection with services provided by former Acorn employees and recognized such amount as
compensation expense ratably over the 12 month period following the acquisition. Future lease and
other contractual obligations were immaterial at the time of the acquisition.

Peribit Acquisition:

On July 1, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Peribit. The
acquisition enabled the Company to secure and assure the delivery and performance of applications
over an IP network through premium traffic processing. The acquisition of Peribit will further
expand the Company’s customer base and portfolio of products. The acquisition resulted in the
issuance of 11.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of approximately
$256.4 million to the former shareholders of Peribit, of which, approximately 1.6 million shares
with a fair value of $35.2 million, established as of the acquisition date, were being held in
escrow for indemnity obligations prescribed by the merger agreement. The common stock issued in the
acquisition was valued using the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over a
five-day trading period beginning two days before and ending two days after the date the
transaction was announced on April 26, 2005. The Company also assumed all of the outstanding
Peribit stock options with a fair value of approximately $36.4 million. Such options were valued
using Black-Scholes option pricing model with the volatility assumption of 41%, expected life of
1.8 years, risk-free interest rate of 3.6%, and a market value of the Company’s common stock of
$22.62 per share, which was determined as described above. At the close of the acquisition, the
Company recorded a liability of $3.0 million associated with future lease, severance, and other
contractual obligations through



March 2009. In July of 2006, the Company released 0.8 million shares valued at $10.3 million
to the former shareholders of Peribit which were formerly held in escrow. The Company continues to
hold an additional 0.8 million shares are being held in escrow to secure certain indemnity
obligations prescribed by the merger agreement. The escrow amounts were excluded from the original
purchase price of $312.0 million. The remaining shares in escrow expired on February 1, 2007.
Almost all the escrow shares were distributed in February 2007 at the then current market value of
$19.15 per share, or an aggregate fair value of $14.1 million.

Redline Acquisition:

On May 2, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Redline. Redline
was a pioneer in the development of Application Front End (“AFE”) technology and designed network
solutions that improve the performance, flexibility, and scalability of web-enabled enterprise data
centers and public web sites. The purchase price for Redline included a cash payment of $97.5
million, a $3.0 million pre-acquisition loan from the Company to Redline which was forgiven, and
assumed stock options with an aggregate fair value of $21.1 million. The stock options were valued
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the inputs of 43% for volatility, 1.56 years for
expected life, 3.5% for risk-free interest rate and a market value of Juniper Networks common stock
of $22.62 per share, which was determined by using the average closing price of the Company’s
common stock over a five-day trading period beginning two days before and ending two days after the
date the transaction was announced on April 26, 2005. The Company also assumed $1.0 million in net
liabilities. The Company recorded an additional $13.2 million cash escrow payment to the original
purchase price of $123.1 million related to Redline’s indemnity obligations which expired in 2006.

Kagoor Acquisition:

On May 1, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Kagoor. Kagoor
was a leading provider of session border control products for voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP)
networking. The purchase price for Kagoor included $58.2 million in cash and assumed stock options
with an aggregate fair value of $7.6 million. The stock options were valued using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the inputs of 43% for volatility, 1.58 years for expected life, 3.5% for
risk-free interest rate and a market value of Juniper Networks common stock of $21.64 per share,
which was determined by using the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over a
five-day trading period beginning two days before and ending two days after the date the
transaction was announced on March 29, 2005. Excluded from the aggregate purchase price of $66.3
million is an escrow payment of $6.8 million related to the indemnity obligations associated with
this acquisition, $2.0 million of which was paid in 2006. In 2007, the Company distributed an
additional $4.6 million to former Kagoor stockholders in final settlement of the escrow account.

In-Process Research & Development:

The Company’s methodology for allocating the purchase price
for purchase acquisitions to in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is determined through
established valuation techniques in the high-technology communications equipment industry. Projects
that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have
no alternative future use. IPR&D is expensed upon acquisition. For the year ended December 31,
2005, total IPR&D expense was $11.0 million in connection with the Funk, Peribit and Kagoor
acquisitions. There was no IPR&D for the Acorn and Redline acquisitions.

For Funk, these efforts pertained to the development of Radius products including Steel-Belted
Radius (“SBR”), SBR High Availability (“HA”), and Mobile IP Module (“MIM”) II products. Funk’s
IPR&D as of the acquisition date also included development of the new versions for Endpoint
Assurance, for Proxy (Remote Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time of the
acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next four
months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.9 million.

For Peribit, these efforts included the development of the next versions of software for the
Sequence Reducer (“SR”) family, Sequence Mirror (“SM”) family, the Central Management System
(“CMS”) products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of the
acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next twelve
months at an estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million.

For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation
products and operating systems. At the time of the acquisition, it was estimated that these
development efforts will be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of
approximately $0.8 million.

As of December 31, 2006, total estimated costs of completing the research and development
efforts relating to the above acquisitions were immaterial.

Deferred Stock-Based Compensation:

Unvested stock options valued at $13.2 million, $3.8
million, and $2.0 million were issued for the Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor acquisitions,
respectively. The unvested portion of the intrinsic value of the replacement stock options,
established as of the acquisition date, has been allocated to deferred compensation in the purchase
price allocation and is being amortized to expense using the graded-vesting method over the
remaining vesting period.



2004 Acquisition

NetScreen Acquisition:

On April 16, 2004, Juniper Networks completed its acquisition of
NetScreen. The acquisition resulted in the issuance of approximately 132.0 million shares of the
Company’s common stock with a fair value of approximately $3,651.2 million to the former
stockholders of NetScreen. The common stock issued in the acquisition was valued using the average
closing price of the Company’s common stock over a five-day trading period beginning two days
before and ending two days after the date the transaction was announced. Juniper Networks also
assumed all of the outstanding NetScreen stock options with a fair value of approximately $520.5
million. The options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the inputs of
0.8 for volatility, 3 years for expected life, 2.5% for the risk-free interest rate and a market
value of Juniper Networks common stock of $27.64 per share, which was determined as described
above. The Company also incurred direct costs associated with the acquisition of approximately
$13.4 million. After the initial purchase price allocation, the Company decreased the net tangible
assets acquired and increased goodwill by $6.1 million. The change was due to the recognition of a
pre-acquisition contingency of $12.0 million, partially offset by a number of reductions in the
valuation of certain pre-acquisition accruals.

The Company accrued for acquisition charges of $21.3 million primarily related to severance
and facility charges. Ninety-four former NetScreen employees were identified for termination at the
time of the acquisition, and all related severance has been paid. The remaining restructuring
change consists primarily of facility charges that will be paid through the end of the lease terms,
which extend through 2008. In 2006, the Company reversed an immaterial amount of this acquisition
accrual. In 2005, the Company reversed $6.9 million of this acquisition accrual primarily due to
re-occupation of the former NetScreen facilities. As of December 31, 2006, $1.6 million remained to
be paid, of which $0.6 million is recorded in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Order backlog represents the value of the standing orders for both products and services. The
order backlog was valued using the avoided cost method, which estimates the avoided selling
expenses due to the fact that NetScreen had firm purchase orders in place at the time of
acquisition. Juniper Networks amortized the fair value of acquired order backlog in 2004 to cost of
revenues.

Of the total purchase price, $27.5 million was allocated to in-process research and
development (“IPR&D”) and was expensed in 2004. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that
have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use.
Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta-phase working prototype in which
there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition, NetScreen had
multiple IPR&D efforts under way for certain current and future product lines. These efforts
included developing and integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips, as well as other
functions and features such as next generation Internet Protocol (“IP”), wireless and digital
subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability. The Company utilized the DCF method to
value the IPR&D, using rates ranging from 20% to 25%, depending on the estimated useful life of the
technology. In applying the DCF method, the value of the acquired technology was estimated by
discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with
which the technology is associated, over the remaining economic life of the technology. To
distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows
attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues, adjustments were made to
provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working capital, and other assets that provide value to
the product lines. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition, it was estimated that these
development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of
approximately $25.0 million. These development efforts were completed in by December 2005. As of
December 31, 2006, there were no remaining costs associated with these research and development
efforts.

Unvested stock options and restricted stock valued at $93.5 million have been allocated to
deferred compensation in the purchase price allocation and are being amortized to expense using the
graded-vesting method over the remaining vesting period. The value represented the unvested portion
of the intrinsic value of the replacement stock options and restricted stock established as of the
acquisition date, Options assumed in conjunction with the acquisition had exercise prices ranging
from $0.09 to $27.11 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $12.48 per share and a
weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately 8 years. Juniper Networks assumed
approximately 5.9 million vested options and approximately 20.5 million unvested options and
restricted stock.

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the second quarter ended June 30, 2006, the Company concluded that the carrying value
of goodwill for the SLT segment was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $1,280.0 million.
A significant portion of the goodwill was initially recorded based on stock prices at the time the
related merger agreements were executed and announced. The impairment of goodwill was primarily
attributable to the decline in the Company’s market capitalization that occurred over a period of
approximately six months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the
forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach.

The first step of the impairment test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to
its carrying value, including the goodwill related to the respective reporting units. If the
calculated fair value of the reporting units exceed the carrying value, goodwill is considered
impaired and the Company is required to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation in order
to calculate the extent of the goodwill impairment. The Company determined that it had four
reporting units at the time of the impairment calculation, consisting of Infrastructure and Service
which are the same as the respective segments and Security and Application Acceleration



which were the two components of SLT segment. The Company utilized external service providers
to calculate the fair value of the reporting units using a combination of the income and market
approaches. The income approach requires estimates of expected revenue, gross margin and operating
expenses in order to discount the sum of future cash flows using each particular business’ weighted
average cost of capital. The Company’s growth estimates were based on historical data and internal
estimates developed as part of its long-term planning process. The Company tested the
reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of its discounted cash flow analysis by comparing to
available market data. In determining the carrying value of the reporting unit, the Company
allocated the fair values of shared tangible net assets to each reporting unit based on revenue. As
the fair values of the Security and Application Acceleration reporting units were lower than the
allocated book values, the Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment calculation for
those two reporting units within the SLT segment.

During the second step of the goodwill impairment review, management calculated the fair value
of the Company’s tangible and intangible net assets with the assistance of external service
providers. Identified intangible assets were valued specifically for each reporting unit tested.
The difference between the calculated fair value of each reporting unit and the sum of the
identified net assets results in the residual value of goodwill. Future impairment indicators,
including further declines in the Company’s market capitalization, could require additional
impairment charges. There was no goodwill impairment in 2005 and 2004.

In 2006, the goodwill increase was primarily attributable to the settlements of the Company’s
escrow obligations. The Company released from its escrow accounts 0.8 million shares of common
stock, with a total market value of $10.3 million, and $2.0 million of its restricted cash for the
indemnity obligations associated with acquisitions of Peribit Networks, Inc. (“Peribit”) and Kagoor
Networks, Inc. (“Kagoor”), respectively. The Company also distributed $13.1 million of its
restricted cash for the escrow obligations associated with the acquisition of Redline Networks,
Inc. (“Redline”).

Restated year end balances include $6.0 million and $18.5 million decreases in goodwill for
2005 and 2004, respectively, related to misclassified tax benefits from deductions from stock
options assumed in acquisitions.

Note 5. Restructuring and Acquisition Related Reserves

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring charges were based on Juniper Networks’ restructuring plans that were committed
to by management. Any changes in the estimates of executing the approved plans will be reflected in
the Company’s results of operations. The following table shows changes in the restructuring

In June 2006, the Company implemented a restructuring plan that
focused on some IPG segment product development cost reduction efforts and the discontinuation of
the SBC product. Approximately $2.0 million including $0.6 million of severance charges for 33
employees was paid in 2006. In addition to the payments relating to the 2006 plan, the Company paid
$0.7 million for facility charges associated with its restructuring plans initiated prior to 2006.
As of December 31, 2006, the restructuring reserves of $1.5 million relate to future facility
charges. Amounts related to the net facility charge are included in other accrued liabilities and
will be paid over the remaining respective lease term through July 2008. The difference between the
actual future rent payments and the net present value will be recorded as operating expenses when
incurred.



During 2004, the Company
adjusted its restructuring reserve established in prior year by $1.4 million primarily for changes in its
facilities sublease assumptions.

Acquisition Related Restructuring

Acquisition related reserves pertain to the restructuring reserves established in connection
with the Company’s past acquisitions. In conjunction with various acquisitions, the Company accrued
for acquisition related restructuring charges primarily related to severance and facility charges.
During 2006, the Company paid $3.0 million primarily for the facility related charges. As of
December 31, 2006, approximately $3.6 million remained unpaid, of which $1.5 million was recorded
in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2005,
approximately $6.9 million remained unpaid, of which $3.3 million was recorded in other long-term
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. During 2006, the Company reversed its existing
acquisition restructuring by $0.4 million that was previously accrued for the Unisphere and
NetScreen facilities. During 2005, the Company reversed its existing acquisition related
restructuring reserves by $6.9 million primarily due to changes in estimates of the previous
accrual for the NetScreen facility. During 2004, the Company reduced
its acquisition related restructuring charges by $3.7 million
primarily for changes in facilities sublease assumptions.

The following restructuring charges were based on Juniper Networks’ restructuring and
acquisition related restructuring plans that were committed to by management. Any changes to the
estimates of executing the approved plans will be reflected in Juniper Networks’ results of
operations. Details of the Company’s restructuring reserve and acquisition reserve charges recorded
in operating expense were as follows (in millions):

There was no significant realized gain or loss from the sale of available-for-sale securities
in 2006. There were realized losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities of $0.9 million,
and $0.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006 the Company had approximately 250 investments that were in an
unrealized loss position. The gross unrealized losses related to these investments were due to
changes in interest rates. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to
settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Given that the
Company has the ability and intent to hold each of these investments until a recovery of the fair
values, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be
other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2006. The Company reviews its investments to
identify and evaluate investments that have indication of possible impairment. The Company
aggregated its investments by category and length of time the securities have been in a continuous
unrealized loss position. The following table shows a summary of the fair value and unrealized

Note 7. Long-Term Debt

In 2003, Juniper Networks received $392.8 million of net proceeds from an offering of $400.0
million aggregate principal amount of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (the
“Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of
payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all
of the Company’s existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the
notes. The Senior Notes are convertible into shares of Juniper Networks common stock, subject to
certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks.
The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes,
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

The carrying amounts and fair values of the Senior Notes were (in millions):

During 2005 and 2006, an immaterial amount of the Company’s Senior Notes was converted into
common shares. During 2004, the Company paid $145.0 million to retire its outstanding 4.75%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2007. Such retirement resulted in a net loss of $4.1
million during 2004. The loss represented the difference between the carrying value of the
Subordinated Notes at the time of the retirement, including unamortized debt issuance costs, and
the amount paid to extinguish such Subordinated Notes.

Due to the stock option investigation, the Company did not file its quarterly reports on Form
10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 by the respective due dates. The
Company received a Notice of Default on August 25, 2006 from the Trustee of the Senior Notes
alleging that the Company was in violation of certain provisions of the Indenture relating to the
Senior Notes as a result of its failure to file and was given a 60-day cure period to file its
quarterly reports. The holders of the Senior Notes may have had the right to accelerate the Senior
Notes by sending the Company a valid Notice of Acceleration in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture so long as the Event of Default was continuing. As of the filing of this report, the
Company had not received a Notice of Acceleration. Upon the filing of the Company’s Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 the alleged default
and Event of Default relating to the late filings of these reports is no longer continuing.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash as of December 31, 2006 consisted of escrow accounts required by certain 2005
acquisitions and the Directors & Officers (“D&O”) trust. Juniper Networks established the D&O trust
to secure its indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers arising from their
activities as such in the event that the Company does not provide or is financially incapable of
providing indemnification. In 2006, the Company reduced restricted cash by $5.9 million as its
deposit requirements for standby letters of credits issued for facility leases was removed,
distributed $13.1 million of its restricted cash upon the settlement of certain escrow funds
associated with the Redline acquisition and distributed $2.0 million of its restricted cash upon
the settlement of certain escrow funds associated with the Kagoor acquisition. In 2005, the Company
added $12.2 million, $2.5 million, $13.5 million and $6.9 million to restricted cash for the escrow
accounts established in connection with the acquisitions of Funk, Acorn, Redline and Kagoor,
respectively. No significant restricted cash was accrued or paid in 2004.

Equity Investments

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying values of the Company’s minority equity
investments in privately held companies were $20.4 million and $13.2 million, respectively.

In 2006, the Company made $7.3 million of minority investments in privately-held companies. In
2005, the Company invested a total of $11.0 million in privately held companies. In addition, the
Company recognized a gain of $1.7 million due to a business combination of one of its portfolio
companies with a cost basis of $1.0 million and wrote down $0.4 million against its investment in
one of the privately held companies.



Deferred Revenue

Amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue and accounts

Restructuring and acquisition related expenses of $5.9 million in 2006 primarily consisted of
the $5.6 million bonus and earn-out accrual associated with the Funk and Acorn acquisitions. During
2006, the Company also recorded $0.3 million in net restructuring charges and acquisition related
restructuring charges. The $6.5 million credit to restructuring expense in 2005 primarily consisted
of a $6.9 million reversal adjustments related to its restructuring accrual when the Company
re-occupied a portion of the former NetScreen facility that was previously included in the
acquisition-related reserve. In 2004, the Company also recorded net adjustments of $5.1 million to
the previously established restructuring reserves primarily for changes in estimates related to
changes in lease and sublease assumptions.

The Company recorded no significant costs in 2006 and 2005 related to the integration of
acquired product lines or business units during those years. Integration costs of $5.1 million were
recognized for the NetScreen acquisition in 2004. Integration expenses are incremental costs
directly related to the integration of the two companies. The integration expenses consisted
principally of facility related expenses, workforce related expenses and professional fees.

In 2006, the Company incurred legal and professional fees of $20.5 million in connection with
its stock option investigation. See Note 2 for additional information.

The Company recorded a $10.1 million operating expense in 2006 in relation to certain tax
related items. See Note 2 for additional information.

Operating Leases

Juniper Networks leases its facilities under operating leases that expire at various times,
the longest of which expires in 2016. Rental expense for 2006, 2005 and 2004, was approximately
$40.3 million, $36.4 million, and $29.8 million, respectively. Future minimum payments under the
non-cancellable operating leases totaled $182.2 million as of December 31, 2006. Rent and related
expenses paid to a related party was $4.9 million, $4.4 million, and $3.3 million for 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively.

Purchase Commitments

The Company does not have firm purchase commitments with its contract manufacturers. In order
to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers
place non-cancelable, non-returnable (“NCNR”) orders, which were valued at $120.5 million as of
December 31, 2006, based on the Company’s build forecasts. The Company does not take ownership of
the components and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to Juniper
Networks’ agreements with the contract manufacturers. The components are used by the contract
manufacturers to build products based on purchase orders the Company has received from its
customers. The Company does not incur a liability for products built by the contract manufacturers
until they fulfill its customer’s order and the order ships. However, if the components go unused,
the Company may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges. As of December 31, 2006, the
Company had accrued $22.4 million based on our estimate of such charges.



Other Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2006, other contractual obligations consisted of the following:

•

Escrow amount of $12.8 million related to the Funk acquisition to secure certain
indemnity obligations. One-half of the escrow expired in January 2007 and the remaining
one-half will expire in June 2007. Also included is a contingent bonus payable, based on
certain milestones, of $5.0 million, which was earned over a one year period ended in
2006.

•

Escrow amount of $1.6 million related to the Acorn acquisition to secure certain
indemnity obligations. The escrow period will expire in May 2007. Also included is a
contingent earn-out payable to former Acorn stockholders, based on certain milestones, of
up to $2.2 million, and bonus payable to employees related to continued employment of up
to $0.5 million. The earn-out and bonus amounts will be earned and paid in 2007 and 2008.

•

Escrow amount related to the Redline and Kagoor acquisitions of $0.7 million and
$5.1 million, respectively, to secure certain indemnity obligations.

In addition, 0.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $17.6
million, established as of the acquisition date, were held in escrow to secure certain indemnity
obligations for the Peribit acquisition as of December 31, 2006. Almost all of the escrow shares
were distributed in February 2007 at the then current market value of $19.15 per share, or an
aggregate fair value of $14.1 million.

Guarantees

The Company has entered into agreements with some of its customers that contain
indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that the
Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. Other guarantees or
indemnification arrangements include guarantees of product performance and standby letters of
credits for certain lease facilities. The Company has not recorded a liability related to these
indemnification and guarantee provisions and its guarantees and indemnification arrangements have
not had any significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business, such as employment or intellectual property claims, including the matters described
below. The outcome of any such matters is currently not determinable. Although the Company does not
expect that any such legal claims or litigation will ultimately have a material adverse effect on
its consolidated financial position or results of operations, an adverse result in one or more
matters could negatively affect the Company’s results in the period in which they occur.

Stock Option Lawsuits

Federal Derivative Lawsuits

Between May 24, 2006 and August 17, 2006, seven purported shareholder derivative actions were
filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the
Company and certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors. The lawsuits allege
that the Company’s officers and directors either participated in illegal back-dating of stock
option grants or allowed it to happen. The lawsuits assert causes of action for violations of
federal securities laws, violations of California securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duty,
aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, gross mismanagement, insider selling and constructive fraud. The
actions also demand an accounting and rescission of allegedly improper stock option grants. On
October 19, 2006, the Court ordered the consolidation of these actions as

In Re Juniper Derivative
Actions

, No. 06-03396, and appointed as lead plaintiffs Timothy Hill, Employer-Teamsters Local Nos.
175 & 505 Pension Trust Fund, and Indiana State District Council of Laborers and HOD Carriers
Pension Fund. The Court ordered the lead plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint no later than
January 12, 2007. On February 14, 2007, the parties agreed to extend the deadline for plaintiffs to
file a consolidated complaint until thirty days after the Company completes the filing of its
restated financial statements with the Securities Exchange Commission, and the court approved the
stipulation on February 15, 2007.



State Derivative Lawsuits — California

On May 24, 2006 and June 2, 2006, two purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in
the Santa Clara County Superior Court in the State of California against the Company and certain of
the Company’s current and former officers and directors. These two actions were consolidated as

In
re Juniper Networks Derivative Litigation,

No. 1:06CV064294, by order dated June 20, 2006. A
consolidated complaint was filed on July 17, 2006. The consolidated complaint alleges that certain
of the Company’s current and former officers and directors either participated in illegal
back-dating of stock options or allowed it to happen. The complaint asserts causes of action for
unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste, and
violations of California securities laws for insider selling. Plaintiffs also demand an accounting
and rescission of allegedly improper stock options grants. On July 28, 2006, the defendants filed a
motion to stay all discovery in this action. On August 16, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to
dismiss or stay this action in favor of the federal derivative actions pending in the Northern
District of California. Plaintiffs have not yet filed their oppositions to those two motions. On
November 6, 2006, the parties stipulated that the plaintiffs could file a motion to amend their
complaint and a motion to compel responses to discovery no later than thirty days after the Company
completes the filing of its restated financial statements, and that the hearing on the defendants’
two pending motions will be heard on the same date as the plaintiffs’ two contemplated motions.

Federal Securities Class Actions

On July 14, 2006, a purported class action complaint styled

Garber v. Juniper Networks, Inc.,
et al.,

No. C-06-4327 MJJ, was filed in the Northern District of California against the Company and
certain of the Company’s officers and directors. The plaintiff filed a Corrected Complaint on July
28, 2006. The

Garber

class action is brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s common
stock between September 1, 2003 and May 22, 2006. On August 29, 2006, another purported class
action complaint styled

Peters v. Juniper Networks, Inc., et al.,

No. C 06 5303 JW, was filed in
the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of its officers and directors.
The

Peters

class action is brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s common stock
between April 10, 2003 and August 10, 2006. Both of these purported class actions allege that the
Company and certain of the Company’s officers and directors violated federal securities laws by
manipulating stock option grant dates to coincide with low stock prices and issuing false and
misleading statements including, among others, incorrect financial statements due to the improper
accounting of stock option grants. On November 20, 2006, the Court appointed the New York City
Pension Funds as lead plaintiffs. The lead plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint
on January 12, 2007. The Consolidated Complaint asserts claims on behalf of all purchasers of, or
those who otherwise acquired, the Company’s publicly traded securities from April 10, 2003 through
and including August 20, 2006. The Consolidated Complaint alleges violations of the Securities Act
of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by the Company and certain of the Company’s current
and former officers and directors. On February 15, 2007, the parties agreed that plaintiffs may
file an Amended Consolidated Complaint within thirty days after the Company files its restated
financial statements with the Securities Exchange Commission, and the court approved the
stipulation on February 16, 2007.

Other Matters

IPO Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG
Cowen Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase (Hambrecht & Quist
LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc., Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated (collectively, the “Underwriters”), the Company and certain of
the Company’s officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s common
stock in the Company’s initial public offering in June 1999 and its secondary offering in September
1999.

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that the prospectus pursuant to which
shares of common stock were sold in the Company’s initial public offering and its subsequent
secondary offering contained certain false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the
practices of the Underwriters with respect to their allocation of shares of common stock in these
offerings and their receipt of commissions from customers related to such allocations. Various
plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar allegations concerning the initial public offerings
of approximately 300 other issuers. These various cases pending in the Southern District of New
York have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as

In re Initial Public Offering Securities
Litigation

, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the
action against the Company, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Defendants in the coordinated proceeding filed motions to dismiss. In October
2002, the Company’s officers were dismissed from the case without prejudice pursuant to a
stipulation. On February 19, 2003, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to
dismiss, but declined to dismiss the claims against the Company.



In June 2004, a stipulation for the settlement and release of claims against the issuers,
including the Company, was submitted to the Court for preliminary approval. The terms of the
settlement, if approved, would dismiss and release all claims against participating defendants
(including the Company). In exchange for this dismissal, Directors and Officers insurance carriers
would agree to guarantee a recovery by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants of at least
$1.0 billion, and the issuer defendants would agree to an assignment or surrender to the plaintiffs
of certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters. On August 31, 2005, the
Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On April 24, 2006, the Court held a fairness
hearing in connection with the motion for final approval of the settlement. The Court did not issue
a ruling on the motion for final approval at the fairness hearing. The settlement remains subject
to a number of conditions, including final court approval. On December 5, 2006, the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Court’s October 2004 order certifying a class in the
case against the Company, which along with five other issuers, was selected as a test case by the
underwriter defendants and plaintiffs in the coordinated proceeding. It is unclear what impact this
will have on the settlement and the case against the Company.

Toshiba Patent Infringement Litigation

On November 13, 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed suit in the United States District Court in
Delaware against the Company, alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe four Toshiba
patents, and seeking an injunction and unspecified damages. A Markman hearing was held in April
2006, and a ruling favorable to the Company was issued on June 28, 2006. Toshiba stipulated to
non-infringement of the four patents and filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit. The Delaware court has removed the trial, previously scheduled for August 2006,
from its calendar, pending resolution of the appeal. The Company expects the appeal will not be
heard before July 2007.

IRS Notices of Proposed Adjustments

The IRS has concluded an audit of the Company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years
1999 and 2000. During 2004, the Company received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) from the
IRS. While the final resolution of the issues raised in the NOPA is uncertain, the Company does not
believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position or results of operations. The Company is also under routine examination by
certain state and non-US tax authorities. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for
any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these audits.

In conjunction with the IRS income tax audit, certain of the Company’s US payroll tax returns
are currently under examination for fiscal years 1999 — 2001, and the Company received a second
NOPA in the amount of $11.7 million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing
of tax deposits related to employee stock option exercises. The Company responded to this NOPA in
February 2005, and intends to dispute this assessment with the IRS. An initial appeals conference
was held on January 31 and October 3, 2006. The appeals process available to the Company has not
been concluded. In the event that this issue is resolved unfavorably to the Company, there exists
the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Note 10. Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Repurchase Activities

In July 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors (“the Board”) authorized a stock repurchase
program. This program authorized repurchases of up to $250.0 million of the Company’s common stock.
In 2006, the Company repurchased 10,071,100 common shares at an average price of $18.51 per share
as part of this stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2006, a total of 12,939,700 common
shares had been repurchased and retired since the inception of the program, equating to
approximately $250.0 million at an average price of $19.32 per share. The purchase price of $63.6
million and $186.4 million for the shares of the Company’s stock repurchased in 2004 and 2006,
respectively, was reflected as a reduction to retained earnings.

In July 2006, the Company’s Board approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the
Company to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of Juniper Networks’ common stock under this program. In
February 2007, the Company’s Board approved an increase of $1.0 billion under this new stock
repurchase program. Coupled with the prior authorization of $1.0 billion announced in July 2006,
the Company is now authorized to repurchase up to a total of $2.0 billion of its common stock.
Purchases under this plan will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time.
Acquisitions under the share repurchase program will be made from time to time as permitted by
securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be discontinued at any time.



Stock Option Plans

Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Plan

The Company’s Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Plan (the “1996 Plan”) provided for the granting
of incentive stock options to employees and non-statutory stock options to employees, directors and
consultants. On November 3, 2005, the Board adopted an amendment to the 1996 Plan to add the
ability to issue RSUs under the 1996 Plan. RSUs represent an obligation of the Company to issue
unrestricted shares of common stock to the grantee only when and to the extent that the vesting
criteria of the award are satisfied. In the case of RSUs, vesting criteria can be based on time or
other conditions specified by the Board or an authorized committee of the Board. However, until
vesting occurs, the grantee is not entitled to any stockholder rights with respect to the unvested
shares. The Company had authorized 164,623,039 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1996
Plan. Effective May 18, 2006, additional equity awards under the 1996 Plan have been discontinued
and new equity awards are being granted under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”).
Remaining authorized shares under the 1996 Plan that were not subject to outstanding awards as of
May 18, 2006 were canceled on May 18, 2006. The 1996 Plan will remain in effect as to outstanding
equity awards granted under the plan prior to May 18, 2006.

Under the 1996 Plan, incentive stock options may not be granted at an exercise price less than
the fair market value per share of the common stock on the date of grant. The Company has not
granted incentive stock options since June 1999. Non-statutory stock options may be granted under
the terms of the plan at an exercise price determined by the Board of Directors or a committee
authorized by the Board of Directors. See Note 2, “Restatement of Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements.” Vesting and exercise provisions were permitted to be determined under the terms of the
plan by the Board of Directors or a committee authorized by the Board. Options granted under the
1996 Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant and
have a maximum term of ten years. Options granted to consultants were in consideration for the fair
value of services previously rendered, are not contingent upon future events and were expensed in
the period of grant. See Note 2, “Restatement of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.”)

The 1996 Plan also provided for the sale of restricted shares of common stock or RSUs to
employees and consultants. Shares issued to consultants were for the fair value of services
previously rendered and were not contingent upon future events. Shares sold to employees were made
pursuant to restricted stock purchase agreements containing provisions established by the Board or
a committee authorized by the Board. These provisions give Juniper Networks the right to repurchase
the shares at the original sales price upon termination of the employee. This right expires at a
rate determined by the Board, generally at the rate of 25% after one year and 2.0833% per month
thereafter. As of December 31, 2006, zero shares were subject to repurchase under the 1996 Plan.

2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan

In July 2000, the Board adopted the Juniper Networks 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (the
“2000 Plan”).

The 2000 Plan provided for the granting of non-statutory stock options to employees, directors
and consultants. Non-statutory stock options may be granted under the terms of the plan at an
exercise price determined by the Board or a committee authorized by the Board. See Note 2,
“Restatement of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.” Vesting and exercise provisions were
permitted to be determined under the terms of the plan by the Board or an authorized committee of
the Board. Options granted under the 2000 Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year period
beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years. Options granted to consultants
were in consideration for the fair value of services previously rendered, were not contingent upon
future events and were expensed in the period of grant. The Company had authorized 90,901,437
shares of common stock for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Effective May 18, 2006, additional equity
awards under the 2000 Plan have been discontinued and new equity awards are being granted under the
2006 Plan. Remaining authorized shares under the 2000 Plan that were not subject to outstanding
awards as of May 18, 2006 were canceled on May 18, 2006. The 2000 Plan will remain in effect as to
outstanding equity awards granted under the plan prior to May 18, 2006.

2006 Equity Incentive Plan

On May 18, 2006, the Company’s stockholders adopted the 2006 Plan to enable the granting of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, restricted stock, stock appreciation
rights, performance shares, performance units, deferred stock units or dividend equivalents to the
employees and consultants of the Company. The 2006 Plan also provides for the automatic,
non-discretionary award of nonstatutory stock options to the Company’s non-employee member of the
Board (“outside directors”).

The maximum aggregate number of shares authorized under the 2006 Plan is 64,500,000 shares of
common stock, plus the addition of any shares subject to outstanding options under the 1996 Plan
and 2000 Plan that subsequently expired unexercised after May 18, 2006 up to a maximum of
75,000,000 additional shares of the common stock. To the extent a 2006 Plan award is settled in
cash rather than stock, such cash payment shall not reduce the number of shares available for
issuance under the 2006 Plan. No restricted stock,



stock appreciation right, performance share, performance unit, deferred stock unit or dividend
equivalent has been issued as of December 31, 2006. The Company had issued 6.6 million and 0.7
million of stock options and RSUs, respectively, under the 2006 Plan as of December 31, 2006.
Restricted stock or RSUs with a per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of market price of
the Company’s common stock on the day of the grant shall be counted as two and one-tenth shares for
every one share. In the case of a restricted stock or performance share award, the entire number of
shares subject to such award would be issued at the time of grant. Such shares could be subject to
vesting provisions based on time or other conditions specified by the Board or an authorized
committee of the Board. The Company would have the right to repurchase unvested shares subject to a
restricted stock or performance share award if the grantee’s service to the Company terminated
prior to full vesting of the award. Until repurchased, such unvested shares would be considered
outstanding for dividend, voting and other purposes.

Incentive stock options are granted at an exercise price of not less than the fair market
value of the Company’s common stock on the date such option is granted. The exercise price of an
incentive stock option granted to a 10% or greater stockholder may not be less than 110% of the
fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. Vesting and exercise provisions are
determined by the Board, or an authorized committee of the Board. Stock options granted under the
2006 Plan generally vest and become exercisable over a four year period. Restricted stock,
performance shares, RSUs or deferred stock units that vest solely based on continuing employment or
provision of services will vest in full no earlier than the three year anniversary of the grant
date. In the event vesting is based on factors other than continued future provision of services,
such awards will vest in full no earlier than the one year anniversary of the grant date. Options
granted under the 2006 Plan have a maximum term of seven years from the grant date while incentive
stock options granted to a 10% or greater stockholder have a maximum term of five years from the
grant date.

The 2006 Plan provides each outside director an automatic grant of an option to purchase
50,000 shares of common stock upon the date on which such individual first becomes an outside
director, whether through election by the stockholders of the Company or appointment by the Board
to fill a vacancy (the “First Option”). In addition, at each of the Company’s annual stockholder
meetings (i) each outside director who was an outside director on the date of the prior year’s
annual stockholder meeting shall be automatically granted an option to purchase 20,000 shares of
common stock, and (ii) each outside director who was not an outside director on the date of the
prior year’s annual stockholder meeting shall receive an option to purchase a pro-rata portion of
the 20,000 shares of the common stock determined by the time elapsed since the individual’s First
Option grant (“the Annual Option”). The First Option vests monthly over approximately three years
from the grant date subject to the outside director’s continuous service on the Board. The Annual
Option shall vest monthly over approximately one year from the grant date subject to the outsider
director’s continuous service on the Board. Under the 2006 Plan, options granted to outside
directors have a maximum term of seven years.

Plans Assumed Upon Acquisition

In connection with past acquisitions, the Company assumed options and restricted stock under
the stock plans of the acquired companies. The Company exchanged those options and restricted stock
for Juniper Networks’ options and, in the case of the options, authorized the appropriate number of
shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to those options. As of December 31, 2006, there were
approximately 8,779,075 shares outstanding under plans assumed through acquisitions. During the
year ended December 31, 2006, 333 shares of restricted common stock were repurchased at an average
price of $0.35 per share in connection with employee terminations. There were no restricted shares
subject to repurchase as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2005, there were approximately
15,472,302 shares outstanding under plans assumed through acquisitions. During 2005, 6,517 shares
of restricted common stock have been repurchased at an average price of $0.33 per share in
connection with employee terminations. There were 33,586 shares of restricted shares subject to
repurchase as of December 31, 2005.

The pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised was $107.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2006. This intrinsic value represents the difference between the fair market value of
the Company’s common stock on the date of the exercise and the exercise price of each option.

Total fair value of options vested during 2006 was $106.3 million. As of December 31, 2006,
approximately $82.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years. Approximately $28.4 million
of the total unrecognized compensation cost is estimated to be forfeited prior to the vesting of
such awards and has been excluded from the preceding cost.

Restricted Stock Units Activity

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had 3.2 million RSUs outstanding which were excluded from

1.8 years. Approximately $14.6 million of the total unrecognized compensation cost is estimated to
be forfeited prior to the vesting of such awards and has been excluded from the preceding cost.

Extension of Stock Option Exercise Periods for Former Employees

The Company cannot issue any securities under its registration statements on Form S-8 during
the period it is not current in its SEC reporting obligations for filing its periodic reports under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, options vested and held by the Company’s former
employees cannot be exercised until the completion of the Company’s stock option investigation and
the Company’s public filings obligations have been met (the “trading black-out period”). During
2006, approximately 1,446,000 such options were due to expire. The Company extended the expiration
date of these stock options to the end of a 30–day period subsequent to the Company’s filing of its
required regulatory reports. As a result of the modification, the fair value of such stock options
have been reclassified to current liabilities subsequent to the modification and are subject to
mark-to-market provisions at the end of each reporting period until final settlement. The Company
measured the fair value of these stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation
model and recorded an aggregate fair value of approximately $6.1 million under current liabilities
as of December 31, 2006. Any changes to the fair values of these options in future periods until
settlement will be expensed in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations in the period of
change.

Acceleration of Unvested and “Out-of-the-Money” Employee Stock Options

On December 16, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the
vesting of certain unvested and “out-of-the-money” stock options that had an exercise price per
share equal to or greater than $22.00, all of which were previously granted under its stock option
plans and that were outstanding on December 16, 2005. Options to purchase approximately 21.2
million shares of common stock or 49.3% of the total outstanding unvested options on December 16,
2005 were accelerated. The options accelerated excluded options previously granted to certain
employees, including all of the Company’s executive officers and its directors.



In addition, the acceleration of the unvested and “out-of-the-money” options was accompanied
by restrictions imposed on any shares purchased through the exercise of accelerated options. Those
restrictions will prevent the sale of any such shares prior to the date such shares would have
originally vested had the optionee been employed on such date, whether or not the optionee is
actually an employee at that time.

The purpose of the acceleration was to enable the Company to avoid recognizing compensation
expense associated with these options in future periods in the Statements of Operations pursuant to
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123R (“SFAS 123R”). Under SFAS 123R, the Company
has applied the expense recognition provisions relating to stock options beginning in the first
quarter of fiscal 2006. In approving the acceleration, the Company’s Board considered its impact on
future financial results, stockholder value and employee retention. The Board believes that the
acceleration of the unvested and “out-of-the-money” options was in the best interest of
stockholders as it will reduce the Company’s reported compensation expense in future periods in
light of these accounting regulations. As a result of the acceleration, the Company expected to
reduce the pre-tax stock option expense it otherwise would have been required to record by
approximately $153.0 million, which was estimated at the time of the acceleration, subsequent to
the adoption of SFAS 123R beginning in 2006. The acceleration of the vesting of these options did
not result in a charge to the results of operations in 2005.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On December 16, 2005, the Board of Directors amended the Company’s 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) to eliminate the ability of a participant under the ESPP to increase the
rate of his/her payroll deductions during any offering period (as defined in the ESPP). This change
was effective beginning with the offering period commencing on February 1, 2006.

In April 1999, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of Juniper Networks 1999 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”). The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to acquire
shares of the Company’s common stock through periodic payroll deductions of up to 10% of base
compensation. Each employee may purchase no more than 6,000 shares in any twelve-month period, and
in no event, may an employee purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock, determined at the fair
market value of the shares at the time such option is granted, in one calendar year. The Purchase
Plan is implemented in a series of offering periods, each six months in duration, or a shorter
period as determined by the Board. The price at which the common stock may be purchased is 85% of
the lesser of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the
applicable offering period or on the last day of the respective offering period. On December 16,
2005, the Board amended the Company’s ESPP to eliminate the ability of a participant under the ESPP
to increase the rate of his/her payroll deductions during any offering period (as defined in the
ESPP). This change was effective beginning with the offering period commencing on February 1, 2006.
For 2006, pre-tax compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the ESPP was $6.6
million. Compensation expense for the ESPP in the same 2005 periods was only required as a footnote
disclosure prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R. As a result of the Company’s failure to file its
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of 2006, the Company has suspended
its employee payroll withholdings for the purchase of its common stock under the ESPP from August
2006 through the filing of all its required regulatory reports. In January 2007, the Board of
Directors approved a delay of the start of next offering period from February 1, 2007 to April 1,
2007 (such offering period will end on July 31, 2007).

Employees purchased approximately 1,748,000 shares, 912,000 shares and 769,000 shares of
common stock through the ESPP at an average exercise price of $13.06, $19.96 and $15.39 per share
during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During 2006, the number of authorized shares
under the ESPP increased by 3,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 6,490,500
shares had been issued and 8,509,500 shares remained available for future issuance under the ESPP.
As of December 31, 2005 approximately 4,742,700 shares had been issued and 7,257,300 shares
remained available for future issuance. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 3,831,100 shares had
been issued at an average price of $7.95 per share, and 8,168,900 shares remained available for
future issuance under the ESPP.

Stock-Based Compensation

Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation

SFAS 123R requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based
awards. The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which
incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and risk-free interest rates.
The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over
the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company’s stock
options, adjusted for other relevant factors including implied volatility of market traded options
on the Company’s common stock. The expected life of an award is based on historical



experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees, as well
as the potential effect from options that had not been exercised at the time.

In 2006, the Company began granting stock option awards that have a contractual life of seven
years from the date of grant. Prior to 2006, stock option awards generally had a ten year
contractual life from the date of grant. As a result, the expected term assumption used in the year
ended December 31, 2006 reflects the shorter contractual life of the new option awards granted
during the period.

The assumptions used and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of
options granted and for employee stock purchases under the ESPP during those periods are summarized
as follows:

In anticipation of adopting SFAS 123R, the Company refined the variables used in the
Black-Scholes-Merton model during 2005. As a result, the Company refined its methodology of
estimating the expected term to be more representative of future exercise patterns. The Company
also refined its computation of expected volatility by considering the volatility of publicly
traded options to purchase its common stock and its historical stock volatility. The weighted
average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during 2006, 2005, and 2004 was
$6.09, $9.23 and $11.44 per option, respectively. The weighted average estimated fair value of
shares granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $5.19, $6.36
and $4.44 per share, respectively.

Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance

At December 31, 2006, Juniper Networks had reserved an aggregate of approximately 174,223,000
shares of common stock for future issuance under all its Stock Option Plans, the 1999 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and for future issuance upon conversion of convertible senior notes.

Convertible Preferred Stock

There are 10,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock with a par value of $0.00001 per
share authorized for issuance. No preferred stock was issued and outstanding as of December 31,
2006 and 2005.

Note 11. 401(k) Plan

Juniper Networks maintains a savings and retirement plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Employees meeting the eligibility requirement, as
defined, may contribute up to the statutory limits of the year. The Company has matched employee
contributions since January 1, 2001. The matching formula was 50% up to 6% of eligible pay (up to
an annual maximum of $2,000). Effective on January 1, 2005, the Company increased the match from
50% to 100% of eligible pay, up to an annual maximum of $2,000. Effective January 1, 2007, the
Company matches 25% of all employee contributions. All matching contributions vest immediately. The
Company’s matching contributions to the plan totaled $5.8 million, $5.1 million and $3.1 million in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.



Note 12. Segment Information

An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business
activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses and about which separate financial
information is available. It is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”)
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

In 2005, the Company’s CODM and senior management team (together “management”) began to
allocate resources and assess performance based on financial information by categories of products
and by service. Following the acquisitions of Funk, Acorn, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor, the
Company combined the products from these acquired companies with the Security segment to create the
SLT operating segment. As a result, the Company currently has the following operating segments:
Infrastructure, SLT, and Service. The Infrastructure segment includes products from the E-, M- and
T-series router product families as well as the circuit-to-packet products and SBC products. Prior
to 2006, SBC products were included in the SLT segment which includes security products and
application acceleration reporting units. Beginning in 2007, the Company will no longer segregate
the two reporting units within the SLT segment. The SLT segment consists primarily of firewall and
virtual private network (“VPN”) systems and appliances, secure sockets layer VPN appliances,
intrusion detection and prevention appliances (“IDP”), application front end platforms, the
J-series router product family, Odyssey products and wide area network (“WAN”) optimization
platforms. The Service segment delivers world-wide services to customers of the Infrastructure and
the SLT segments.

In 2004, management evaluated the Company’s performance by geographic theater and by
categories of products based only on revenues. Management did not assess the performance of its
geographic theaters or categories of products on other measures of income or expenses; therefore,
the Company only had one operating segment.

The re-alignment of operating segments in 2005 was due to a shift in management structure and
responsibilities to measure the business based on product and service profitability. Commencing in
the fourth quarter of 2005, the primary financial measure used by the management in assessing
performance and allocating resources to the segments is management operating income, which includes
certain cost of revenues, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and
general and administrative expenses. Direct costs, such as standard costs, research and
development, and product marketing expenses, are applied directly to each operating segment.
Indirect costs, such as manufacturing overhead, other cost of sales, are allocated based on
standard costs. Indirect operating expenses, such as sales, business development, and general and
administrative expenses are allocated to each operating segment based on factors including
headcount and revenue. Prior period information has been included for comparative purposes.
Financial information for each operating segment used by management to make financial decisions and
allocate resources is as follows (in millions):

The Company does not allocate its assets by segment.

Note 13. Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per
share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that were outstanding during the
period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental common shares subject to
repurchase, common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, and shares issuable upon
conversion of the Subordinated Notes. The following table presents the calculation of basic and
diluted net income per share (in millions, except per share data):

For 2006, the Company excluded 34.6 million common stock equivalents consisting of
convertible debt, outstanding stock options, RSUs and shares subject to repurchase from the
calculation of diluted loss per share because all such securities were anti-dilutive due to the net
loss in the period. For the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004, approximately 51.1 million, 28.8
million and 11.9 million common stock equivalents were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had a valuation allowance on its U.S.
domestic deferred tax assets of approximately $38.7 million and $40.6 million, respectively, which
relates to capital losses that will carry forward to offset future capital gains. The valuation
allowance decreased by $1.9 million, $224.7 million and $2.3 million in the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 reduction was attributable to use of the capital
losses carryovers. The 2005 reduction was attributable to the Company’s determination that a
valuation allowance was no longer necessary for its net U.S. deferred tax assets because based
on the available evidence at the end of the year it determined that
realization of these net assets
was more likely than not. The 2004 net reduction was primarily attributable to an increase in
deferred tax liabilities from the NetScreen acquisition and an increase in deferred tax assets
related to excess tax benefits of stock option deductions.

As part of the restatement, the Company increased deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2005
by approximately $213 million. The benefit of this change in deferred tax assets was recorded as an
increase to additional paid-in capital by the corresponding amount.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had federal and California net operating loss
carry-forwards of $44.3 million and $20.5 million, respectively. The Company also had federal and
California tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $50.6 million and $63.5 million,
respectively. Unused net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry-forwards will
expire at various dates beginning in the years 2021 and 2012, respectively.

The Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the
subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. The
Company has made no provision for U.S. income taxes on approximately $227.3 million of cumulative
undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2006 because it is the
Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings. If such earnings were distributed, the
Company would accrue additional income taxes expense of approximately $66.8 million. These earnings
are considered indefinitely invested in operations outside of the U.S. as we intend to utilize
these amounts to fund future expansion of our international operations.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 — Repatriation of Foreign Earnings

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“Jobs Act”), enacted on October 22, 2004, provides for
a temporary 85% dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during either
fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2005. The deduction results in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the
repatriated earnings. During 2005, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors
approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the Jobs Act to repatriate $225.0 million in
foreign earnings in 2005.

The Company repatriated $225.0 million under the Jobs Act in 2005. It recorded a net tax
benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation dividend. The net tax benefit
consists of a federal and state tax provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million, offset by a
tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un-repatriated
earnings.

The unaudited selected financial data for the 2005 interim periods has been restated to
reflect adjustments related to the associated tax impact as further described in Note 2. The
consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 has not been
restated as the incremental stock-based compensation expense from the restatement of employee
stock options was insignificant for the period and therefore has been recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2006.



The following table presents the effects of the stock-based compensation and related tax
adjustments upon the Company’s previously reported condensed consolidated statements of operations

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior quarter balances in order to conform to
the current year’s presentation.

The 2005 quarterly results reflect the impact of the acquisitions of Kagoor and Redline in the
second quarter, Peribit in the third quarter, and Acorn and Funk in the fourth quarter, and the
ongoing effects of these operations for the remainder of the year. Basic and diluted net losses per
share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented, therefore, the sum of the
quarters may not be equal to the full year net income (loss) per share amounts.

Note 16. Subsequent Event

Stock Repurchase Program

In February 2007, the Company’s Board approved an increase of $1.0 billion under the stock
repurchase program approved in July 2006. Coupled with the prior authorization of $1.0 billion
announced in July 2006, the Company is now authorized to repurchase up to a total of $2.0 billion
of its common stock. Purchases under this plan will be subject to a review of the circumstances in
place at the time. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program will be made from time to time
as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be discontinued at
any time.



ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures

None.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures

Stock Option Grant Practices and Restatement

As discussed in Note 2 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K,
during 2006, an independent investigation related to our historical stock option granting practices
was carried out by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. As a result of the
investigation, we reached a conclusion that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial
accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior periods. Therefore, we have
recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with regard
to past stock option grants, substantially all of which relate to options granted between June 9,
1999 and December 31, 2003. We are restating previously filed financial statements in the quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q for June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 and in this annual report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Remediation of Past Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

As a result of this investigation, we identified certain material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting related to our stock option granting practices and the related
accounting in periods ending prior to June 30, 2006.

Before 2003, we did not have sufficient safeguards in place to monitor our control practices
regarding stock option pricing and related financial reporting, the result of which is discussed in
Item 8, Note 2 of this report. From 2003 through 2006 we implemented improvements to procedures,
processes, and systems to provide additional safeguards and greater internal control over our
financial reporting processes including, but not limited to, the stock option granting and
administration function, in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”) and evolving accounting
guidance. These improvements included, but were not limited to:

We believe that these changes remediated the past material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting related to our stock option granting practices and the related accounting
and reduced to remote the likelihood that any incorrect measurement dates or any material error in
accounting for stock options could have occurred during the last fiscal year and not been detected
as part of our financial reporting close process. As a result, we believe that the likelihood that
a material error in our financial statements could have originated during the last fiscal year and
not been detected as of December 31, 2006 was remote.



In addition to the significant improvements implemented between 2003 and 2006 discussed above,
we will adopt other measures identified by the Board of Directors to enhance the oversight of the
stock option granting and administration function and the review and preparation of financial
statements, including, but not limited to, the following:

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of our CEO and CFO, which are required
in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This “Controls
and Procedures” section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation
referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for
a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that
it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that
material information relating to our consolidated operations is made known to our management,
including the CEO and CFO, particularly during the period when our periodic reports are being
prepared.

Changes in Internal Controls

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
fourth quarter of 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
