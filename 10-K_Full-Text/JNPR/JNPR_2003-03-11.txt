ITEM 1. Business

Overview

We are a leading provider of network infrastructure solutions that
transform the business of networking by converting bandwidth — a
commodity — into a dependable, secure and highly valuable corporate asset. Our products,
services and solutions enable service providers and other network-intensive
businesses to support and deliver services and applications on a highly
efficient and low cost integrated network. Our products are designed and
purpose-built for service provider networks and offer our customers
best-in-class performance with less complexity and cost than legacy
alternatives. Unlike conventional routers, originally developed for enterprise
applications and increasingly inadequate for use in the highly scaled public
and private networks, our products are specifically designed to accommodate
substantial size, scope and security demands.

We lead the industry in transforming packets into profit for network
service providers, wireless and cable operators, government agencies, research
and education networks and information-intensive enterprises. Our acquisition
of Unisphere Networks, Inc., completed in July 2002, has enabled us to extend
our ability to supply shared access applications expertise to the leading
service providers, carriers and PTTs throughout the world.

We were incorporated in California in 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware
in 1997 with our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our
corporate mailing address is 1194 North Mathilda Avenue, Sunnyvale, California
94089 and the telephone number at that location is (408) 745-2000. Our website
is www.juniper.net.

Industry Background

The Internet has evolved from an academic research project into a network
of hundreds of separately administered, public and private networks
interconnected using Internet Protocol (IP). IP traffic continues to grow,
driven by increasing numbers of new users, connected devices and Internet
transactions. The result of the widespread use of IP is a ubiquitous network
that today carries a large and growing amount of data traffic enabling millions
of users to share information and conduct electronic commerce. Industry
research firms forecast continued growth worldwide in the Internet and Internet
traffic. The importance of IP continues to increase as the number of users,
connected devices and transactions over the highly scaled public and private
networks increases.

The rapid adoption of the Internet and the tremendous growth of IP traffic
have prompted service providers to construct large-scale data networks. These
highly scaled public and private networks are being optimized to transport data
traffic as compared to traditional telephone networks, which were



optimized to transport voice traffic. The architecture of these next
generation networks is being driven by two key technologies: packet/cell
switching and optical networking.

Advantages of Packet/Cell Switching

. Packet/cell switching technology,
which divides data traffic into distinct units called packets or cells and
routes each packet or cell independently, provides superior use of available
network capacity compared to traditional circuit switching technology. In a
circuit switched network, each data stream, such as a voice telephone call
between two points, is provided with a dedicated channel, or circuit, for the
duration of the telephone call. This approach leads to inefficient use of
network resources because a channel is fully dedicated to each transaction,
whether or not data is actually flowing at any given moment. As a result,
circuit switched architecture is highly inefficient for Internet applications
which tend to create large bursts of data traffic followed by long periods of
silence. Packet/cell switching architectures enable greater utilization out of
a fixed capacity circuit by combining traffic that has different capacity
demands of the circuit at different times. Packet/cell switches more
efficiently fill the available network bandwidth with packets of data from many
users, thereby reducing the wasted bandwidth due to silence from any one
particular user. The use of packet/cell switching is driving the architecture
of the Internet to be fundamentally different from traditional circuit switched
voice based networks. In packet/cell switched networks, IP has emerged as the
de facto standard for providing services to end users. Other packet/cell
switching products include frame relay switches, asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) switches and routers.

Rapid Advances in Optical Networking

. Optical networking technology uses
pulses of light, rather than pulses of electricity, to transmit data in a
network, and uses fiber optic connections instead of wires. Optical networking
can be used to transmit much more information over a given connection than
electrical signals can convey. Optical networking advances, such as dense
wavelength division multiplexing, or DWDM, which allows transmission of several
frequencies of light over one strand of optical fiber, have enabled still
higher data transmission rates and improved efficiency of bandwidth
utilization. Packet/cell technologies have not kept up with optical
technologies and traditional packet switching equipment is not capable of
forwarding packets at rates sufficient to keep pace with optical transmission
speeds. Our IP-based products are purpose-built to meet these requirements.

Fundamental Requirements for Highly Scaled Public and Private Networks

The reliability and performance of current network infrastructure
equipment have become and continue to be critical issues for service providers
as they support dramatic growth in IP traffic and increasingly seek to offer
new revenue generating, mission-critical and other services. The need for high
reliability, high performance, high performance under stressful conditions,
scalability, interoperability and cost effectiveness are fundamental
requirements in meeting the needs associated with the growth in IP traffic.
New requirements will continue to arise for next generation networks, which
will drive a set of new requirements for network infrastructure equipment.

High Reliability

. As businesses and consumers increasingly rely on the
Internet for mission-critical applications, high network reliability becomes
essential. Service providers are increasingly expected to provide a similar
degree of reliability on the Internet that users have become accustomed to on
the traditional telephone network. The “five nines” (99.999%) reliability
standard of the traditional telephone network is becoming the target to which
suppliers of next-generation Internet platforms are being compared. As service
providers begin to bundle voice and data on their networks, this high degree of
reliability is becoming even more critical.

High Performance

. To handle the rapid growth in IP traffic, today’s
networks increasingly require routers that can operate at higher speeds. The
processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated
forwarding technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination
based on priority, data type and other considerations. Since a large number of
IP packets, many of which perform critical administrative functions, are small
in size, high performance Internet routers need to achieve their specified
transmission speeds even for small packet sizes. Since smaller packets
increase packet processing demands, routing large numbers of smaller packets
tends to be more resource intensive than routing of larger packets. A wire
speed router, which achieves its specified transmission rate for any type



of traffic passing through it, can accomplish this task. Thus,
provisioning of mission-critical services increasingly requires the high
performance enabled by wire speed processing.

High Performance Under Stressful Conditions

. In a large and complex
network, individual components inevitably fail. However, the failure of an
individual device or link must not compromise the network as a whole. In a
typical network, when a failure occurs, the network loses some degree of
capacity and, in turn, a greater load falls on the remaining network routers,
which must provide alternate routes. Routers must quickly adjust to the new
state of the network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping
significant numbers of packets when active routes are lost or when large
numbers of routes change. Routing protocols are used to accomplish this
convergence, a process that places even greater stress on the router. Given
the complexity of Internet infrastructure, particularly compared to enterprise
networks, the convergence process is far more complex and places a far greater
load on the routing software, thereby requiring a much more sophisticated
device.

Scalability

. Due to the rapid growth in IP traffic, service providers must
continuously expand their networks, both in terms of increased numbers of
access points of presence (PoPs), and also greater capacity per PoP. To
facilitate this expansion process, network infrastructure equipment must be
highly scalable. Next generation routers therefore need to be upgradeable and
configurable to function within constantly changing networks while incurring
minimal downtime.

Interoperability

. Service providers do not have the time or inclination to
change their existing networks to favor introduction of new products; rather,
new products must be compatible with the existing environment. Given the open
and inter-connected nature of the Internet, the complexity of running an
Internet backbone network requires a service provider to control and police
relations with other service providers. For example, service providers must
carefully control what traffic is accepted under what conditions from other
providers. The software in each router must offer 100% compatibility with the
interior protocols and standards used within each service provider’s backbone
network. The compatibility level must be maintained despite changes to
software equipment configuration and network architecture and upgrades to the
various protocol standards. Thus, routing software must be flexible and
quickly upgradeable to support any necessary revisions. This level of
compatibility, in turn, cannot impact the performance, scalability or
reliability of the equipment. Attaining this sophisticated level of
interoperability is highly challenging and requires significant testing to
ensure compatibility.

Cost Effectiveness

. Growth in IP traffic and intense price competition in
the telecommunications market continues to require service providers to seek
solutions that significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build
and operate their networks. In addition to the basic cost of equipment such as
routers, service providers incur substantial ancillary costs in terms of space
required to deploy the equipment, power consumption and on-going operations and
maintenance. Service providers therefore want to deploy dense and varied
equipment configurations in limited amounts of rack and floor space.
Therefore, in order to continue to scale their networks toward higher data
speeds in a cost effective manner, service providers need the ability to mix
and match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities,
without significantly increasing the consumption of space or power.

There is a clear need for next generation routers that can support high
speeds and offer new IP-based services. Network operators are eagerly seeking
new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within
their networks and reduce the cost of their architectures.

The Juniper Networks Solution

We developed, marketed and sold the first commercially available
purpose-built Internet backbone router optimized for the specific high
performance needs of service providers. As the need for core bandwidth
continued to increase, the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the
network was created. Our products are designed to address the needs at the
core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless and cable access by
combining the features of high-performance ASIC-based packet forwarding
technology, our software and a network-optimized architecture.



Software

. Our software has been designed to meet the IP network routing,
operations and control requirements of the world’s largest service providers
and is an integral embedded component of our product family system
architecture. The ability of our software to manage the complex network
sharing relationships among service providers allows our products to be placed
at critical points in the core of a service provider’s network. Our software
allows our products to have widespread network placement due to its
interoperability with Cisco’s Internetwork Operating System, or IOS, currently
the most broadly deployed routing operating system.

Unconstrained by legacy routing software, we developed our software using
a modular design, in which distinct functions are implemented as separate
modules with well defined interfaces and interactions, simplifying
troubleshooting and maintenance. These features keep functionality distinct,
and minimize the impact of any failure that may occur to the specific software
application in which the failure occurs. Also, we believe the modularity of
our software will enable the continuous upgrade of new enhanced capabilities,
while protecting reliability and compatibility with existing networks.

High Performance ASIC-Based Packet Forwarding Technology

. Our products
utilize high performance ASIC-based technology. The result is a platform that
is substantially faster than today’s general purpose microprocessor based
routers in its ability to process and forward IP packets, allowing our products
to deliver high performance at wire speed. The ability to enhance and
implement large scale ASICs will be a long-term differentiator for us,
particularly as the sophistication required to forward traffic across higher
speed networks increases.

Network Optimized Architecture

. Our products employ an architecture
designed exclusively for the highly scaled public and private networks. The
system architecture provides a clean separation between the routing and
packet-forwarding functions. Separating these two functions enables us to
develop independently a full-featured routing protocol and traffic engineering
functionality through our software and wire speed packet forwarding performance
through high performance ASICs.

Juniper Networks Products

. Our products have been developed or acquired
as part of our strategy to provide the reliable delivery of core, edge,
wireless and cable Internet services at scale for the New Public Network.

As part of our product and services offerings, our Model for Integrated
Network Transformation (MINT) provides a business and network framework that
enable service providers to transition from a commodity transport business
model to a more lucrative, value-added services model. Technologies such as IP
routing, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) and Packet Processing have been successfully deployed in a number
of service provider networks for a number of years and have now been enhanced
and matured to a degree that they can now be applied to solving issues such as
the supply of new IP based services and consolidating legacy networks.

The MINT provides an operational approach to apply the technologies
appropriate to the revenue opportunities being presented to our customers. The
MINT advocates a software based approach in the provision of services similar
to the model that has proved to be successful in the telephony market. It
defines a new operational model for service providers to address the data
communications market by:

•

addressing underserved markets with new services and a low
touch/low cost operational model improving the profitability of
these service; and

•

supporting existing services such as Frame Relay, ATM,
Internet access with a better cost model – the same service but a
better cost model.

Our M-series and T-series product platforms share common software and
services, and common family of ASIC technology for full compatibility and
scalability. Critical service provider applications including high-speed
access, peering, and hosting are served by our platforms. Physical interfaces
are interchangeable between most platforms, increasing user flexibility and
allowing common sparing. Our solution provides several key benefits to our
customers: carrier class reliability, wire speed performance, scalability,
interoperability, flexibility, reduced complexity and cost effectiveness. The
M-series and T-



series products leverage our third generation of high-density silicon and
the same proven JUNOS software that is common across all of our M-series and
T-series platforms to ensure continuous and predictable service delivery, while
minimizing capital and operational costs. This ensures network service
providers migrating ATM and FR traffic to MPLS transport are able to do so
smoothly and seamlessly without disruption to customer applications.

Our E-series products are designed to allow simultaneous delivery of
high-speed services over dedicated connections, such as T1, T3 and optical
interfaces, as well as over DSL, cable and wireless connections from a single
system. By delivering multiple high-speed access services from a single
system, our products reduce the need to purchase, install and operate multiple
pieces of equipment. The combination of our software and hardware allows
communications service providers to deploy new high-value data services. Our
E-series products support value-added data services for business-critical
applications across the Internet, such as virtual private networks and priority
service levels, or IP quality of service.

Our
J-series product, developed together with Ericsson A.B., provides a
scalable solution for both GPRS and WCDMA networks and supports wireless
operators in their evolution from voice-centric GSM networks to the new
multimedia-rich 3G networks. Through the use of consistent software features
in our M-series routers and the new Ericsson GGSN application software, operators gain
scalability advantages, including the ability to natively offer the latest IPv6
standard for IP networking—which includes advanced quality of
service (QoS) features,
as well as vast new IP addressing capabilities. The J-series products natively
support high packet-forwarding performance and robust, standards-based QoS
capabilities—including support for Differentiated Services (DiffServ),
Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), and all four 3GPP R3 QoS classes. The
result is the first carrier-class GGSN capable of handling demanding high-speed
data multimedia services such as streaming video, real-time gaming,
videoconferencing and live application sharing. The J-series products can be
integrated into an existing backbone network and the operator gains with ease
of deployment and cost-of-ownership benefits through using the same
infrastructure for GPRS/WCDMA and other types of IP access. We sell the
J-series products exclusively through our reseller Ericsson.

The G-series products, based on CableLabs® DOCSIS™ 1.1 and interim
PacketCable specifications, combine the CMTS with our M-series routers allowing
cable operators to efficiently deliver advanced IP services, including VoIP
through two-way cable plants, and offer interoperability with call management
servers, media gateways, billing and provisioning systems and multimedia
terminal adapters. The G-series products utilize a purpose-built
DOCSIS-compliant integrated circuit – the Broadband Cable Processor ASIC,
to allow cable operators to deliver more bandwidth for advanced IP services and
with superior RF performance and thereby simultaneously supporting a higher
number of cable modems and to lower capital expenses.

The Juniper Networks Strategy

Our objective and strategy is to transform the business of networking by
converting bandwidth, which is a commodity, into a dependable, secure and
highly valuable corporate asset. Our technological leadership and problem
solving abilities combined with our experience and fundamental understanding of
high performance Packet Processing will help us in meeting our objectives. Key
elements of our strategy are described below.

Maintain and Extend Technology Leadership

. Our ASIC technology, software
and network-optimized product architecture have been key elements to
establishing our technology leadership. We believe that these elements are
highly leverageable into future products we are currently developing. We
intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the network
infrastructure market through continued significant investment to enhance the
feature richness of our products and to develop future differentiated offerings
for service providers.

Leverage Early Lead as Supplier of Purpose-Built Network Infrastructure

.
From inception we have focused on designing and building network infrastructure
for service providers and have integrated purpose-built software and hardware
into a network optimized architecture that specifically meets service



providers’ needs. We believe that many of these customers will deploy
network infrastructure equipment from only a few vendors. The
purpose-built advantages of our products provide us with a time-to-market lead,
which is a critical advantage in gaining rapid penetration as one of these
selected vendors. Once our products are widely deployed in a service
provider’s network as the primary or even secondary network infrastructure
equipment, we believe we create a significant barrier to entry to potential
competitors who do not currently offer commercially-viable next generation
routing solutions.

Work Very Closely With Key Customers

. In developing our products,
including our software, we worked very closely with customers to design and
build a product specifically to meet their complex needs and, over the last
four years, we have expanded our understanding of the challenges facing these
carriers, enabling us to subsequently design additional features and
capabilities into both our software and hardware. We believe our close
relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers have been key
elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date. We plan to continue
to work very closely with our key customers to implement enhancements to
current products as well as to design future products that specifically meet
their evolving needs. We are also actively involved with these customers in
developing key standards, such as MPLS, and are an active participant in
standards organizations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force and the
Optical Internetworking Forum.

Increase
Penetration at Major Service Providers

. Our initial focus was to penetrate several of the largest service providers, where operators
have the technical sophistication, resources and desire to test and evaluate
our solution against potential alternatives. We believe that there is a
significant opportunity to further penetrate these large and complex networks
given the advantages of our products.

Enable New IP-Based Services

. Our platform enables service providers to
build networks cost effectively and to offer new differentiated services for
their customers more efficiently than conventional products. We believe that
the delivery of IP-based services and applications, including web hosting,
outsourced Internet and intranet services, VPNs, outsourced enterprise
applications and voice-over IP, will continue to grow and are cost-effectively
enabled by our network infrastructure solutions.

Technology

Our core technology consists of our backbone router architecture, software
and ASIC hardware expertise. Our general-purpose architecture was initially
embodied in the M40, but also is designed to serve as the platform for our
future generations of core products. We have products based on our M-series
and T-series platforms, our E-series platforms, our J-series platform and our
G-series platform.

Our software offers a full suite of scalable, Internet-tested routing
protocols. Protocols and software tools, which are used to control and direct
network traffic, are critical to a network routing solution. Software control
is made more important by the fact that the size and complexity of backbone
networks are increasing at a time when service providers are looking to
differentiate themselves through value-added service offerings.

Customers

Our customers include end users and value added resellers. We recognize
revenue from the shipment of products at the time of shipment unless we have
future obligations for network interoperability or if we have to obtain
customer acceptance. In those cases, we defer recognition of the revenue and
related costs until we have met our obligations.

Ericsson accounted for approximately 17% of our recognized product
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Sales and Marketing

We sell and market our products primarily through our direct sales
organization and value-added resellers.



Direct Sales

. Our North American direct sales organization is divided into
regional operations with our direct sales efforts focused on the largest
service providers. The direct sales account managers cover the market on an
assigned account basis and work as a team with account oriented systems
engineers. They are directed by a regional operations manager who reports to
the North American Vice President of Sales. We also have technical engineers
that consult with and provide our customers with guidance and assistance on the
evolution of their networks as it relates to the deployment of our products.
These consulting engineers also help in defining the features that are required
for our products to be successful in specific applications. A key feature of
our sales effort is the relationship we establish at various levels in our
customers’ organization. Our sales team maintains contact with key individuals
who have service planning and infrastructure buildout responsibility.

Value Added Resellers

. We have complemented our direct sales effort in the
United States through the addition of several highly focused value added
resellers. Our arrangements with value added resellers typically have been
non-exclusive and provide the value added reseller with discounts based upon
the volume of their orders.

Strategic Distribution Relationships

. We have established a strategic
distribution relationship with both Ericsson A.B. and Siemens A.G. We
believe that both Ericsson and Siemens have significant customer relationships
in place and offer products that complement ours. Our agreements with Ericsson
and Siemens allow them to distribute our products on a worldwide, non-exclusive
basis with discounts based upon the volume. Ericsson and Siemens provide the
first level of support to its customers.

International Resellers

. We have established, in addition to Ericsson and
Siemens, strategic value added reseller relationships with Nortel and Alcatel
to sell and service our products on a worldwide non-exclusive basis. To
further our international sales objectives, we also have established a number
of country specific value added resellers. These resellers have expertise in
deploying complex network infrastructure equipment in their respective markets
and provide the first level of support required by our international customers.

As of December 31, 2002, we employed 410 people in our sales and marketing
organizations.

Customer Service and Support

We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the
successful installation and ongoing support of our products and we have hired
support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services. We
offer the following services: 24 hours a day, seven days a week technical
assistance (on-line, telephone and on-site), professional services, educational
services, logistics services and web-based information.

We offer a variety of flexible and comprehensive support programs,
including basic hardware and software warranty services, next day onsite parts
and labor, 24 hours a day, seven days a week same day parts and labor and
on-site resident engineers. We deliver these services directly to major end
users and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the
capabilities of our partners and third party organizations. We also train our
partners in the delivery of education and support services.

Customer service and support provide front line product support and is the
problem resolution interface to our partners and direct end users. If customer
service and support are unable to resolve an issue themselves, they duplicate
the problem scenario and provide the failure information, such as logs, traces
and system configuration to appropriate subject matter experts in our
engineering department.

Based on the severity of the problem and the impact to our customers’
network, there are strict escalation guidelines to ensure that the appropriate
technical resources and management attention is brought to bear on the problem
in a timeframe commensurate with problem priority. The overall goal is to fix
the problem, at the appropriate level, in the right timeframe in order to
ensure our customers’ satisfaction.



As of December 31, 2002, we employed 165 people in our worldwide customer
service and support organization.

Research and Development

We have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in
the fields of high end computing, network system design, Internet routing
protocols and embedded software. These individuals have been drawn from
leading computer data networking and telecommunications companies. In addition
to building complex hardware and software systems, the engineering team has
experience in delivering very large, highly integrated ASICs and extremely
scalable software.

We believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to
our strategy of enhancing our core technology, developing additional
applications, incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness
of our product and service offerings. We are leveraging our third generation
ASICs, developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customer
applications and continuing to develop next generation technology to support
the anticipated growth in network bandwidth requirements. We continue to
expand the functionality of our software to improve performance and
scalability, and to provide an enhanced user interface.

Our research and development process is driven by the availability of new
technology, market demand and customer feedback. We have invested significant
time and resources in creating a structured process for undertaking all product
development projects. This process involves all functional groups and all
levels within our Company. Following an assessment of market demand, our
research and development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional
product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales
organizations. This process is designed to provide a framework for defining
and addressing the steps, tasks and activities required to bring product
concepts and development projects to market.

As of December 31, 2002, we employed 704 people in our research and
development organization.

Our research and development expenses totaled $161.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, $155.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001
and $87.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operation is outsourced. We currently have
manufacturing relationships with Solectron, Celestica and Plexus, under which
we have subcontracted our manufacturing activity. This subcontracting activity
extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as
material procurement, final assembly, test, control and shipment to our
customers. We design, specify and monitor all of the tests that are required
to meet internal and external quality standards. These arrangements provide us
with the following benefits:

•

we conserve the working capital that would be required for funding inventory;

•

we can adjust manufacturing volumes quickly to meet changes in demand;

•

we can quickly deliver products to customers with turnkey
manufacturing and drop shipment capabilities; and

•

we operate without dedicating any
space to manufacturing operations.

Our ASICs are manufactured by IBM who is responsible for all aspects of
the production of the ASICs using our proprietary designs.



Competition

Competition in the network infrastructure market is intense. Cisco
Systems, Inc. has historically dominated the market, with other companies such
as Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies Inc. providing products to a smaller
segment of the market. In addition, a number of public and private companies
have announced plans for new products to address the same problems that our
products address.

Cisco traditionally has been the dominant supplier of solutions to this
market. We believe this is the result of its early leadership position in the
enterprise router market. As both large public and private networks and
traffic over the Internet has grown rapidly, Cisco has leveraged this position
and has developed a broad product line of routers that support all major local
area and wide area interfaces. We believe that our ability to compete with
Cisco depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in
meeting the needs of service providers and are extremely compatible with
Cisco’s current and future products. Although we believe that we are currently
among the top providers of network infrastructure solutions worldwide, we
cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with Cisco,
currently the leading provider in this market.

We expect that, over time, large companies with significant resources,
technical expertise, market experience, customer relationships and broad
product lines, such as Lucent and Nortel, will introduce new products which are
designed to compete more effectively in this market. As a result, we expect to
face increased competition in the future from larger companies with
significantly more resources than we have. Although we believe that our
technology and the purpose-built features of our products make them unique and
will enable us to compete effectively with these companies, we cannot assure
you that we will be successful.

Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco, Lucent and
Nortel, have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle
their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage
customers from purchasing our products. Also, many of our current and
potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer
bases that could be leveraged. Increased competition could result in price
reduction, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market
share, any of which could seriously harm our operating results.

There are also many small public and private companies that claim to have
products with greater capabilities than our products. Consolidation in this
industry has begun, with one or more of these smaller private companies being
acquired by large, established suppliers of network infrastructure products,
and we believe it is likely to continue. As a result, we expect to face
increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly
more resources than we have.

Several companies also provide solutions that can substitute for some uses
of routers. For example, high bandwidth ATM switches are used in the core of certain major backbone service providers. ATM
switches can carry a variety of traffic types, including voice, video and data,
using fixed, 53 byte cells. Companies that use ATM switches are enhancing
their products with new software technologies such as MPLS, which can potentially simplify the task of mixing routers
and switches in the same network. These substitutes can reduce the need for
large numbers of routers.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our
internally developed technology and know-how. Our engineering teams have
significant expertise in ASIC design and we own all rights to the design of the
ASICs, which form the core of our products. Our software was developed
internally and is protected by United States and other copyright laws.

While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law to
protect our technology, we also believe that factors such as the technological
and creative skills of our personnel, new product



developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product
maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology
leadership position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop
technologies that are similar or superior to our technology.

Our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual
property rights and protect our intellectual property rights. While we have
filed patent applications, we cannot be certain that these applications will
issue into patents, that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual
property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual
property rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 2002, we had 1,542 full-time employees, 704 of whom
were engaged in research and development, 410 in sales and marketing, 165 in
customer service and 263 in finance, administration, IT and operations. None
of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any
work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued
service of our key technical, sales and senior management personnel, none of
who is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined
period of time. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Our future success also depends on our continuing
ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified technical, sales and
managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can
be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future.

ITEM 2. Properties

Our corporate headquarters consists of leased facilities located in
Sunnyvale, California where we lease approximately 424,825 square feet located
in three buildings. Each building is on an individual lease with various
option, extension and expansion rights and expire on the following schedule:
Building #1 (144,315 square feet) expires June 30, 2012, Building #2 (122,435
square feet) expires February 14, 2013 and Building #3 (158,075 square feet)
expires May 31, 2014. We also own approximately 80 acres of land adjacent to
the leased corporate headquarters sites.

In
addition, we have leased facilities in Westford, Massachusetts, with
a lease for approximately 225,000 square feet, which expires in 2011. We
also lease various sales office locations throughout the U.S. Outside the
U.S., we have operations in leased sites in EMEA, Asia Pacific and the
Americas. Larger site locations include Ireland, the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, Hong Kong, China, Japan and Australia. We believe that our
existing properties are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our
business. For additional information regarding our obligations under leases,
see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.



ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the
ordinary course of business, including the matters described below. The
outcome of these matters is currently not determinable. However, the Company
does not expect that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

IPO Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs
Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson
Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG Cowen
Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase
(Hambrecht & Quist LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc.,
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated
(collectively, the “Underwriters”), the Company and certain of the Company’s
officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s
common stock in the Company’s initial public offering in June 1999 and its
secondary offering in September 1999. Specifically, among other things, this
complaint alleged that the prospectus pursuant to which shares of common stock
were sold in the Company’s initial public offering and its subsequent secondary
offering contained certain false and misleading statements or omissions
regarding the practices of the Underwriters with respect to their allocation of
shares of common stock in these offerings and their receipt of commissions from
customers related to such allocations. Various plaintiffs have filed actions
asserting similar allegations concerning the initial public offerings of
approximately 300 other companies. These various cases pending in the Southern
District of New York have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as

In re
Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation

, 21 MC 92. In April 2002,
plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the action against the
Company, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Defendants in the coordinated proceeding filed motions
to dismiss. In October 2002, the Company’s officers were dismissed from the
case without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation. On February 19, 2003, the
Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss, but declined to
dismiss the claims against the Company. The Company believes that it has
meritorious defenses to the claims against it and intends to defend itself
vigorously.

Federal Securities Class Action Suit

During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, a number of essentially identical
shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain
of its officers and former officers purportedly on behalf of those stockholders
who purchased the Company’s publicly traded securities between April 12, 2001
and June 7, 2001. In April 2002, the judge granted the defendants’ motion to
consolidate all of these actions into one; in May 2002, the court appointed the
lead plaintiffs and approved their selection of lead counsel and an amended
complaint was filed in July 2002. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants
made false and misleading statements, assert claims for violations of the
federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other
relief. In September 2002, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended
complaint. In March 2003, the judge granted
defendants motion to dismiss with leave to amend. The Company continues to believe the claims are
without merit and intends to defend the action vigorously.

State Derivative Claim Based on the Federal Securities Class Action Suit

In August 2002, a consolidated amended shareholder derivative complaint
purportedly filed on behalf of the Company, captioned

In re Juniper Networks,
Inc. Derivative Litigation

, Civil Action No. CV 807146, was filed in the
Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. The
complaint alleges that certain of the Company’s officers and directors breached
their fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct
including conduct complained of in the securities litigation described above.
The complaint also asserts claims against a Juniper Networks investor. The
Company is named solely as a nominal defendant against whom the plaintiff seeks
no recovery. In October 2002, the Company as a nominal defendant and the
individual defendants filed demurrers to the consolidated



amended shareholder derivative
complaint. In March 2003, the judge
sustained defendants’ demurrers with leave to amend. Plaintiffs must file an amended complaint on or
before May 12, 2003. The Company continues to believe the claims are without
merit and intends to defend the action vigorously.

ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

PART II

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

Our common stock has been quoted on the NASDAQ National Market under the
symbol “JNPR” since June 25, 1999. Prior to that time, there was no public
market for the common stock. All stock information has been adjusted to
reflect the three-for-one split, effected in the form of a stock dividend to
each stockholder of record as of December 31, 1999 and a two-for-one split,
effected in the form of a stock dividend to each stockholder of record as of
May 15, 2000. Juniper Networks has never paid cash dividends on its common
stock and has no present plans to do so. There were approximately 1,623
stockholders of record at February 28, 2003. The following table sets forth
the high and low closing bid prices as reported on NASDAQ:

acquisition of PBC in December 2001. The issuance was exempt from
registration under the Securities Act of 1933.

On July 1, 2002, we issued 36,500,000 shares of common stock to the
stockholders of Unisphere Networks, Inc. (“Unisphere Networks”) in connection
with the acquisition of Unisphere Networks. The issuance was exempt from

ITEM 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data

The following selected consolidated financial data should be read in
conjunction with Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The
information presented below reflects the impact of several accounting
pronouncements, which makes a direct comparison between 2002 and 2001
difficult. For example, in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 141, “Business Combinations,”
we have only included revenue, cost of revenues and operating
expenses from Unisphere Networks, Inc., which was acquired in July
2002, for the second half of 2002. The results for 2003 will include a
full year of results for the combined companies. For a complete
description of matters affecting the results in the tables below, see
Note 3 “Acquisitions,” Note 4 “Goodwill and
Purchased Intangible Assets” and Note 9 “Long-Term
Debt” of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to sales returns, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful
accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially goodwill and intangibles,
contract manufacturer exposures for excess and obsolete material, and
litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Overview

Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks” or “we”) was founded in 1996 to
develop and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of
service providers. The world’s leading network operators, government agencies,
research and education institutions, and information intensive enterprises now
rely upon us as the foundation for uncompromising networks.



Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires us to establish accounting policies that contain
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. These policies include:

•

revenue recognition;

•

the allowance for doubtful accounts, which impacts general and administrative expenses;

•

the valuation of exposures associated with the contract
manufacturing operations and estimating future warranty costs, which
impact cost of product revenues and gross margins; and

•

the initial and continuing valuation of certain long-lived
assets, especially goodwill and other purchased intangible assets,
which could result in an impairment, which would impact operating
expenses.

We have other equally important accounting policies and practices;
however, once adopted, these other policies either generally do not require us to
make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require
implementation of the adopted policy not a judgment as to policy itself.
Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions, actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize product revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” Specifically,
product revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured, unless we have future obligations for
such things as network interoperability or customer acceptance, in which case
revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met. In
most cases, we recognize product revenue upon shipment to our customers,
including resellers, as it is our policy to ensure an end user has been
identified prior to shipment. Our ability to recognize revenue in
the future will be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers
and by our assessment of collectibility. We assess the probability of collection by
reviewing our customers’ payment history, financial condition and credit
report. If the probability of collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is
deferred until the payment is collected.

The amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also
impacted by our judgments taken in establishing our reserve for potential
future product returns. Although our arrangements do not include any
contractual rights of return, and our general policy is that we do not accept
returns, under unique circumstances we have and may in the future accept
product returns from our customers. Therefore, we do provide a reserve for our
estimate of future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is
recorded. Our estimate of future returns is based on such factors as
historical return data and current economic condition of our customer base. In
addition, we get input from our sales and support organizations with respect to
specific customer issues. The amount of revenue we recognize going forward
will be directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for
potential future product returns.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts
receivable. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our
historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the
creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations,
and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact
the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad
debts than previously seen. Our reserves have historically been



adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot
predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers or the
industries that we sell to, we cannot guarantee that our current level of
reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses were to be
significantly greater than the reserves we have established, that would
increase our general and administrative expenses. Conversely, if actual credit
losses were to be significantly less than our reserves, our general and
administrative expenses would decrease.

Contract Manufacturer Exposures

We outsource the majority of our manufacturing, repair operations and
supply chain management operations to our three independent contract
manufacturers. Accordingly, a significant portion of the cost of revenues
consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure
components and manufacture products based on build forecasts we provide them.
Our forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products.
Our estimates of future demand for our products are based on historical trends
and a bottoms-up analysis from our sales and support organizations, adjusted
for overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and product
demand are significantly lower than forecast, we have contractual liabilities
and exposures with all of the contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs
and excess material exposures, which would have an adverse impact on our gross
margins and profitability. The majority of the factors that affect component
usage and demand for our products are outside of our control.

Warranty Reserves

We offer a one-year warranty on all of our hardware products as well as a
90-day warranty on the software embedded in the products. The warranty
generally includes parts, labor and 24-hour service center support. The
specific terms and conditions of those warranties may vary depending on the
products sold and the locations into which they are sold. We estimate the
costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and record a
liability and charge to cost of product sales in the amount of such costs at
the time revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability
include the number of installed units, our estimates of anticipated rates of
warranty claims and costs per claim. Our estimates of anticipated rates of
warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical
information. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty
liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. If actual warranty claims are
significantly higher than forecast, or if the actual costs incurred to provide
the warranty is greater than the forecast, our gross margins could be adversely
affected.

Valuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization. We adopted SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” on January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. For business combinations
consummated before July 1, 2001, goodwill was amortized through December 31,
2001 using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three
years. Goodwill is not amortized for business combinations consummated after
June 30, 2001. Amortization of purchased intangibles is computed using the
straight-line method over the related expected useful lives of between two and
six years.

When valuing goodwill and purchased intangible assets in connection with
the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for
impairment, we estimate future cash flows and useful lives. These estimates
include discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be
generated by the products with which the technology or other identified
intangibles is associated and the periods of time with which the products will
be in demand. We perform goodwill impairment tests annually and on an interim
basis in certain circumstances. We performed an impairment analysis as of
January 1, 2002 and again in November 2002 and determined that there was no
impairment of the goodwill at either time. In addition, we review each
purchased intangible asset quarterly and assess if the amortization period is
still appropriate. Any changes in key assumptions about the business and its
prospects, or changes in market conditions or other externalities, could result
in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations.



Unisphere Business Combination

In July 2002, we completed our acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc.
(“Unisphere”), a subsidiary of Siemens Corporation which is
a subsidiary of Siemens A.G. (“Siemens”). Following the
acquisition and during the remainder of 2002, Siemens, itself
and through its local country affiliates, was one of our
significant resellers. Unisphere developed, manufactured and sold data
networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider
networks. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations,” we have included in our results of
operations for 2002 the results of Unisphere from July 1, 2002. The Unisphere
acquisition resulted in significant impacts to revenue, cost of revenues and
all operating expenses for the second half of 2002. The results for 2003 will
include a full year of results of the combined companies.

Product net revenues decreased $363.2 million in 2002 compared with 2001.
Our net product revenues for 2002 were derived from the sale of all of our
products from 2001, plus from the sale of the following new products:

•

T-Series core Internet routers;

•

J-series wireless router, which was developed through our joint venture with Ericsson AB;

•

E-series Internet routers, which includes the product
acquired through the Unisphere business combination; and

•

G-Series cable routers, which are Cable Modem Termination
System (“CMTS”) products that were developed using the technology
acquired through the Pacific Broadband Communications business
combination.

The decrease in product net revenues in 2002 compared with 2001 was due
primarily to a decrease in the demand for our products that resulted from the
generally unfavorable economic conditions throughout 2002. The decrease was
also due to lower average selling prices as a result of a shift in product mix.
For 2002, one customer accounted for 17% of net product revenues, compared to
2001, where three customers each accounted for 14%, 13% and 11% of net product
revenues.

Product net revenues increased $169.6 million in 2001 compared with 2000.
Three of our five product platforms available during 2001 (M160, M5 and M10)
were introduced during 2000 with the first full year of shipments for these
products occurring in 2001 resulting in an increase in net revenues for 2001
compared to 2000. The increase in product net revenues was also the result of
the continuing increase in market acceptance of our products and, especially in
early 2001, the overall growth in the marketplace due to the growth of data
traffic on the Internet and an increase in the number of customers and
networks. One customer accounted for 18% of net product revenues in 2000.

Service net revenues increased $22.8 million in 2002 compared with 2001.
Service net revenues increased as a result of a larger installed base of
customers and products. A vast majority of service



revenue is from customers who previously purchased our products and enter
into a service contract. In addition to service contracts, service revenue is
generated from providing professional and educational services. Service
contracts are typically for one-year periods and revenue is recognized ratably
over the service period.

Service net revenues increased $43.9 million in 2001 compared with 2000.
The increase in service net revenues was primarily the result of a larger
installed base of customers and products resulting from the continuing increase
in market acceptance of our products and, especially in early 2001, the overall
growth in the marketplace due to the growth of data traffic on the Internet and
an increase in the number of customers and networks.

spending market in the United States declined.

Our gross margins are highly variable and dependent on many factors, some
of which are outside of our control. We have outsourced the majority of our
manufacturing, repair operations and supply chain management operations.
Accordingly, a significant portion of the cost of revenues consists of payments
to our three independent contract manufacturers. The independent contract
manufacturers manufacture our products using quality assurance programs and
standards that we established. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and
documentation are conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and
Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have
facilities in Milpitas, California, Neenah, Wisconsin and Toronto, Canada. As
of December 31, 2002 two of our contract manufacturers retained title to the
underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take
title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract
manufacturer’s facility. As of December 31, 2002, the third contract
manufacturer retained title until title is transferred to our customers upon
shipment from our Westford facility, where the contract manufacturer performs
final configuration, assembly, testing and packaging. As of January 31, 2003,
the third contract manufacturer performs all manufacturing and final
configuration, assembly, testing and packaging at its facilities and retains
title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our
customers take title upon shipment from the contract manufacturer’s facility.
As of December 31, 2002, we had inventory valued at $1.4 million located at our
Westford facility included in other current assets.

Cost of product revenues decreased $139.2 million in 2002 compared with
2001. The decrease in absolute dollars was directly related to the decrease in
product revenue, which was primarily a result of



unfavorable economic conditions many customers experienced throughout
2002, as well as to a 2001 charge of $39.9 million for excess materials
exposure with our contract manufacturers. No significant such charges were
recorded in 2002 for materials exposure matters, but, in accordance with the
purchase accounting rules of SFAS 141, we did recognize one-time charges of
$5.1 million in 2002 relating to the Unisphere acquisition. The charge of $5.1
million included $3.6 million for backlog orders and $1.5 million for an
inventory write-up adjustment. Product gross margins were flat as a result of
operational costs being cut as the demand for our products decreased. We did
not utilize any previously reserved inventory in 2002. We expect our product
gross margins to slightly increase in 2003, as compared to 2002.

Cost of product revenues increased $112.3 million in 2001 compared with
2000. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to the increase
in product net revenues, as well as head count increases in our manufacturing
support organizations. In addition, in 2001, we incurred a charge of $39.9
million relating to an excess materials exposure with our contract
manufacturers. The decrease in product gross margins was primarily a result of
costs in our manufacturing support organizations increasing more than our
product revenues as we originally intended to increase the size of the
organization to meet future demand; however as the economy weakened in 2001,
the expected demand did not materialize. In addition, the excess materials
charge of $39.9 million negatively impacted the 2001 gross margin, as compared
to 2000.

Cost of service revenues decreased $3.4 million in 2002 compared with
2001. The decrease in absolute dollars and increase in service gross margins
were primarily due to realized savings in our Service organization for
personnel and other related costs associated with our restructuring activities,
while service revenue increased as a result of a larger installed base of
customers and products. The increase in gross margin reflects the benefits of
increased service revenues and a more appropriately sized service organization
for our current level of operations. We expect our service gross margins to
increase in 2003, as compared to 2002.

Cost of service revenues increased $22.9 million in 2001 compared with
2000. The increase in absolute dollars is primarily related to the increase in
service contracts, which necessitated head-count increases in our Service
organization. The increase in gross margins was primarily a result of the
Service organization being built in 2000 to meet anticipated future demand.

Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and

The $6.4 million increase in research and development expenses in 2002
compared with 2001 was primarily a result of an increase in headcount related
expenses, the use of outside services and certain overhead costs, partially
offset by savings in prototype equipment. Headcount related expenses and
overhead costs increased primarily due to the Unisphere acquisition. We
realized savings in internally developed and prototype equipment expense during
2002 because throughout 2001 we were preparing for the release of our high-end
T series products, as well as certain M-series and J-series products, and
developing and testing our application specific integrated circuits (ASICS).



The $67.7 million increase in research and development expenses in 2001
compared with 2000 was primarily related to increased salary and related
personnel costs as we increased headcount to expand development efforts in new
products such as T320, T640, M40e and J20.

We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred.
Several components of our research and development effort require significant
expenditures, the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability
in our expenses. For example, a large number of prototypes are required to
build and test our products and the building and testing process occurs over a
short period of time. Our ASIC development requires a payment for
non-recurring engineering charges at the beginning of the process to design and
develop the ASIC. We expense such charges immediately. In addition, per unit
costs are payable when we purchase the prototype ASICs. With several large
ASICs in our architecture, we will incur large non-recurring engineering and
prototype expenses with each significant enhancement of the existing products
and for any new product development. We expect to continue to devote
substantial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of
existing products. We believe that research and development is critical to our
strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading
technology and meet the changing requirements of our customers, we will need to
fund investments in several development projects in parallel. Although we may
experience significant quarterly variability in our research and development
expenses, we expect our annual research and development expenses to be flat to
slightly increase in absolute dollars in the next year.

The $13.6 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2002
compared with 2001 was a result of decreases in employee and partner events,
the reduced use of demonstration equipment, which is expensed immediately, and
consolidation of excess facilities. To date, we have not incurred significant
advertising expenses.

The $51.4 million increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2001
compared with 2000 was primarily attributable to salaries, commissions and
related expenses for personnel engaged in sales, marketing and customer
engineering support functions as we increased headcount during the year. In
addition, costs associated with promotional and other marketing activities such
as product launches and equipment for demonstration and competitive labs
contributed to the increase in 2001.

We intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts
across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market
awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers
worldwide. We believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is
critical to our success and expect these expenses to slightly increase in
absolute dollars in the next year as we initiate additional sales and marketing
programs to support our products.

General and administrative expenses decreased $3.3 million in 2002
compared with 2001. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of
salaries and related expenses for executive, finance, accounting and human
resources personnel, as well as recruiting expenses, professional fees, bad
debt provisions and other corporate expenses. The decrease was due to savings
in headcount related expenses and decreases in the use of outside services. We
expect that general and administrative expenses will slightly decrease in 2003,
as compared to 2002.

General and administrative expenses increased $16.4 million in 2001
compared with 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to the costs
associated with additional headcount to support increased levels of business
activity, as well as increases in the bad debt provision.

In July 2002, we completed the acquisition of Unisphere, a subsidiary of
Siemens. Following the acquisition and during the remainder of 2002, Siemens
was one of our significant resellers. The acquisition resulted in the payment
of $375.0 million cash and the issuance of 36.5 million shares of our common
stock with a fair value of approximately $359.9 million to the former
stockholders of Unisphere. We accounted for this acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting, in accordance with SFAS 141. Accordingly, we
originally recorded goodwill of $769.9 million, purchased intangible assets of
$74.0 million, in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) of $82.7 million
and deferred compensation on unvested stock options of $0.5 million. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142 (“SFAS 142”), “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” the goodwill is not amortized but rather we are required to test the
goodwill for impairment at least annually, and at interim periods if necessary.
The purchased intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated
useful lives, generally between two and six years. The deferred compensation
is being amortized over four years using the graded-vesting method.

In December 2002, we adjusted the originally recorded goodwill of $769.9
by decreasing it by $2.8 million, primarily related to the valuation of certain
assets where we were awaiting further information when we originally allocated
the purchase price. The purchase price allocation depicted is preliminary and
subject to change as we continue to obtain additional information concerning
the fair values of certain liabilities of Unisphere.

In December 2001 and 2000, we acquired Pacific Broadband Communications
(“Pacific Broadband”) and Micro Magic Inc. (“Micro Magic”), respectively. We
accounted for both of these acquisitions under the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of
$137.5 million and $125.7 million, respectively, representing the excess of the
purchase price paid over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired. The
goodwill and other intangibles were being amortized over their respective
useful lives, which we determined to be between two and three years. In
accordance with SFAS 142, there was no goodwill amortization related to the
Pacific Broadband acquisition in 2001 and beginning on January 1, 2002, we no
longer amortized goodwill relating to the Micro Magic acquisition. During
2002, goodwill from the Pacific Broadband business combination increased as a
result of the earn-out provisions of the acquisition agreement and decreased
for certain liabilities that were accrued for at the time of acquisition that
were not realized. Neither of these transactions had an impact on our results
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.

There was no amortization of goodwill in 2002 in accordance with SFAS 142.
Amortization of goodwill increased $35.9 million in 2001 compared with 2000.
The increase was a result of a full year of amortization of goodwill from the
Micro Magic, Inc. acquisition.

Amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation
decreased $62.5 million in 2002 compared with 2001. Amortization of purchased
intangibles was $13.9 million and $2.7 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The increase was due to the acquisition of Unisphere, which contributed $7.3
million in amortization of purchased intangibles during the second half of
2002, and a full year of amortization during 2002 from the Pacific Broadband
acquisition. Amortization of deferred stock compensation was $0.4 million and
$74.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The primary reason for the
decrease was a reversal, as required by APB 25, of $33.5 million in previously
recognized stock compensation expense. This reversal related to the difference
between the expense that had been



previously recognized under the
graded-vesting method for former employees
and the expense that would have been recorded using the straight-line method.
Finally, the decrease in expense is also a result of using the graded vesting
method, which expenses a larger percent in the earlier months.

Amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation
increased $63.6 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The increase was almost
entirely due to a full year of amortization of purchased intangibles and
deferred stock compensation from the Micro Magic acquisition.

The amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation
will increase in 2003 as a result of a full year of amortization of purchased
intangible assets acquired from Unisphere and may increase further in the
future if we make other acquisitions of companies or technologies.

During the third quarter of 2002, in connection with the acquisition of
Unisphere, we approved and initiated plans to restructure the operations to
eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus on strategic product and
customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align product and operating
expenses with existing general economic conditions. Consequently, we recorded
restructuring expenses of approximately $14.9 million, net of a $2.6 million
adjustment for costs that were not going to be incurred due to a change in
estimate, associated primarily with workforce related costs, costs of vacating
duplicative facilities, contract termination costs, non-inventory asset
impairment charges and other associated costs. These costs are accounted for
under EITF Issue No. 94-3 (“EITF 94-3”), “Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity,” and have
been included as a charge to the results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

We also recognized a charge of approximately $5.3 million during the
quarter ended September 30, 2002 related to the land acquired in January 2001
located in Sunnyvale, California. The charge was primarily for costs of
exiting certain contractual obligations associated with the land. We currently
have no plans to continue developing the land in the foreseeable future. The
carrying value of the land increased $2.3 million during 2002 primarily due to
certain development costs incurred in the first half of 2002.

In June 2001, we announced a restructuring program in an effort to better
align our business operations with the current market and service provider
industry conditions. The restructuring program included a worldwide workforce
reduction, consolidation of excess facilities and restructuring of certain
business functions. The costs associated with the restructuring program
totaled $12.3 million and were recorded during the three months ended June 30,
2001 as operating expenses.

Restructuring and other costs increased $7.9 million in 2002 compared with
2001. This increase was a result of the restructuring activities and land
charge in the third quarter of 2002.

Of the total Unisphere purchase price, approximately $82.7 million has
been allocated to in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) and was
expensed in the quarter ended September 30, 2002. Projects that qualify as
IPR&D represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and
which have no alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as
being equivalent to a beta-phase working prototype in which there is no
remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition,
Unisphere had multiple IPR&D efforts under way for certain current and future
product lines. These efforts included developing new cards and modules for
different bandwidths and various software developments. We utilized the
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method to value the IPR&D, using rates ranging
from 30% to 35%. In applying the DCF method, the value of the acquired
technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows
expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is
associated, over the remaining economic life of the technology. To distinguish
between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash
flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues,
adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working
capital and other assets that provide value to the product lines. At the time
of acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts were 55%
complete and would be completed over the next six to twelve months. As of
December 31, 2002 these development efforts were 90% complete and estimate that
they will be completed over the next twelve months.



In connection with the acquisition of Pacific Broadband in December 2001,
we allocated $4.2 million of the $148.3 million purchase price as IPR&D. The
applications from the in-process technology project have been integrated into
our products. The efforts required to complete the acquired in-process
technology included the completion of all planning, designing and testing
activities that were necessary to establish that the product can be produced to
meet its design requirements, including functions, features and technical
performance requirements. The value of the acquired in-process technology was
computed using a discounted cash flow analysis rate of 30% on the anticipated
income stream of the related product revenues. The discounted cash flow
analysis was based on management’s forecast of future revenues, cost of
revenues, and operating expenses related to the products and technologies
purchased from Pacific Broadband. The calculation of value was then adjusted
to reflect only the value creation efforts of Pacific Broadband prior to the
close of the acquisition. At the time of the acquisition, the product was
approximately 75% complete. The majority of the costs to complete the project
was incurred in fiscal 2002 and was not material. The resultant value of
in-process technology was further reduced by the estimated value of core
technology and was expensed in the period the transaction was consummated. The
project was complete as of December 31, 2002.

In connection with the acquisition of Micro Magic in December 2000, we
allocated $10.0 million of the $259.3 million purchase price as IPR&D. The
applications from the in-process technology project have been integrated within
our engineering department. The efforts required to complete the acquired
in-process technology included the completion of all planning, designing and
testing activities that were necessary to establish that the product can be
produced to meet its design requirements, including functions, features and
technical performance requirements. The value of the acquired in-process
technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis rate of 19% on
the anticipated income stream of the related product revenues. The discounted
cash flow analysis was based on management’s forecast of future revenues, cost
of revenues, and operating expenses related to the products and technologies
purchased from Micro Magic. The calculation of value was then adjusted to
reflect only the value creation efforts of Micro Magic prior to the close of
the acquisition. At the time of the acquisition, the product was approximately
88% complete and the project was completed in 2001. The resultant value of
in-process technology was further reduced by the estimated value of core
technology and was expensed in the period the transaction was consummated.

We incurred integration expenses of approximately $2.5 million in the
quarter ended September 30, 2002 resulting from our acquisition of Unisphere.
Integration expenses are one-time incremental costs directly related to the
integration of the two companies that have no go forward benefit, which
consisted principally of workforce related expenses for individuals
transitioning their positions and professional fees during the quarter ended
September 30, 2002. We expect that all of the integration costs relating to
the Unisphere integration have been incurred and that there will be no
additional integration costs in the future related to Unisphere.

There
were charitable contributions of $10.0 million in 2000 in connection with
common stock issued to a charitable foundation. We have not made any similar
contributions in 2002 or 2001 and we currently do not expect to make similar
contributions in the foreseeable future.

Interest income decreased $38.3 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The
decrease was the result of lower cash and investment balances throughout 2002
as we spent $146.0 million to retire a portion of our convertible subordinated
notes and $375.0 million in the Unisphere acquisition. In addition, interest
rates were lower in 2002 as compared to 2001.

Interest income increased $5.8 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The
increase was the result of larger cash and investment balances throughout 2001,
partially offset by a decline in interest rates.

Interest expense decreased $5.8 million in 2002 compared with 2001, namely
due to less interest being owed as a result of the retirement of a portion of
our convertible subordinated notes during the quarter ended September 30, 2002.

Interest expense increased $13.3 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The
increase was due to a full year of interest incurred in 2001 on our convertible
subordinated notes. These notes were issued in March 2000.

Equity in net loss of joint venture decreased $2.8 million in 2002
compared with 2001. During the quarter ended June 30, 2001, we entered into a
joint venture agreement with Ericsson A.B., through our respective
subsidiaries, to develop and market products for the wireless Internet
infrastructure market. Accordingly, we began recording our 40% share of the
joint venture’s loss. During 2002, our share of the joint venture’s loss
totaled approximately $1.3 million. To date, we have funded the joint venture
in the amount of $5.4 million. In addition to this joint venture, Ericsson is
also one of our significant resellers, representing greater than 10% of our
revenues in 2002 and 2001. As of December 31, 2002, we have no further
obligations to fund this joint venture.

In the quarter ended September 30, 2002, we paid approximately $146.0
million to retire a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes Due
March 15, 2007 (the “Notes”). This partial retirement resulted in a gain of
approximately $62.9 million, which was the difference between the carrying
value of the Notes, including unamortized debt issuance costs, at the time of
their retirement, and the amount paid to extinguish such Notes. We are
currently evaluating plans to retire additional Notes in the future, therefore,
we do not consider the gains associated with this repurchase to be
extraordinary, based on the guidance in SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections.”

Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes decreased to $4.5 million in 2002 from $30.0
million in 2001. The effective tax rates for 2002 and 2001 were

- -3.9% and
181%, respectively. The tax rates for 2002 and 2001 include the effects of
write-downs in equity investments and acquisition related charges for goodwill
and in-process research and development, which are non-deductible.

Provision for income taxes decreased to $30.0 million in 2001 from $82.5
million in 2000. In 2000, we recorded tax provisions of $82.5 million
resulting in an effective tax rate of 36%.

The IRS is currently auditing the Company’s federal income tax returns for
fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Proposed adjustments have not been received for
these years. Management believes the ultimate outcome of the IRS audits will
not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have funded our business by selling our common stock in the public
market, issuing convertible subordinated notes and through our operating
activities.

At December 31, 2002, we had cash and cash equivalents of $194.4 million,
short-term investments of $384.0 million and long-term investments of $583.7
million. We regularly invest excess funds in money



market funds, commercial paper and government and non-government debt
securities with maturities of up to five years.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.4 million, $292.8 million
and $269.1 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net cash provided by
operating activities during 2002 was due to the net loss of $119.7 million,
offset by non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization expense,
in-process research and development charges from the Unisphere acquisition,
impairment of minority equity investments, increases in accounts receivable, a
gain on retirement of convertible subordinated notes and decreases in other
accrued liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2001 were
primarily attributed to non-cash charges such as amortization of goodwill,
purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation, write-down of minority
investments, depreciation and a tax benefit from employee stock option plans,
as well as decreases in accounts receivable; offset by cash used in operating
activities in 2001 consisting of net decreases in accounts payable and other
accrued liabilities (excluding the impact of acquisitions), a net loss and
decreases in accrued warranty. Net cash provided by operating activities in
2000 was primarily attributed to the net income, increases in accounts payable
and other accrued liabilities, a tax benefit from employee stock option plans
and non-cash charges such as amortization of goodwill, purchased intangibles
and deferred stock compensation; offset by cash used in operating activities in
2000 consisting of increases in accounts receivable and other assets.

Cash used in investing activities was $295.5 million, $307.4 million and
$894.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash used during all
periods was due to the purchase of capital equipment and available-for-sale
investments, offset by maturities of available-for-sale investments. In
addition, we used cash in 2002 for the Unisphere acquisition. During 2001, the
increase in fixed assets included the purchase of approximately 80 acres of
land in Sunnyvale, California.

Cash used in financing activities was $119.4 million in 2002, compared to
cash provided by financing activities in 2001 and 2000 of $58.5 million and
$1.03 billion, respectively. Cash used in financing activities in 2002
consisted of $146.0 million spent to retire a portion of the Notes, offset by
$26.6 million received from issuance of common stock, as a result of employee
stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan. Cash provided by
financing activities in 2001 was due to proceeds from the issuance of common
stock, namely through employee option exercises. Cash provided by financing
activities in 2000 was due to $1.1 billion received from the issuance of the
Notes and $36.7 million from the issuance of common stock, namely through
employee option exercises. Cash provided by financing activities in 2000 was
offset by expenditures of $130.0 million to repurchase outstanding common
stock.

As of December 31, 2002, our principal commitments consisted of
obligations outstanding under operating leases, firm purchase commitments with
our independent contract manufacturers and Notes. We have potential
contractual liabilities and exposures to all of the independent contract
manufacturers, such as carrying costs and excess material exposures, in the
event that they procure components and build products based on our build
forecasts and the actual component usage and product sales are significantly
lower than forecast. As of December 31, 2002, we had accrued $27.8 million for
potential exposures with our contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs and
excess material. The following table summarizes our principal contractual
obligations at December 31, 2002 and the effect such obligations are expected
to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):

Although we believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund
operations for at least the next 12 months, there can be no assurance that we
will not require additional financing within this time frame or that such
additional funding, if needed, will be available on acceptable terms.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with an Exit or Disposal
Activity.” SFAS No. 146 revises the accounting for exit and disposal
activities under Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit
an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring),” by
spreading out the reporting of expenses related to restructuring activities. A
commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long-lived assets will
no longer be sufficient to record a one-time charge for most restructuring
activities. Instead, companies will record exit or disposal costs when they
are “incurred” and can be measured at fair value. In addition, the resultant
liabilities will be subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows.
SFAS No. 146 is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002. Companies may not restate previously issued
financial statements for the effect of the provisions of SFAS No. 146, and
liabilities that a company previously recorded under EITF Issue 94-3 are
grandfathered. We adopted SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. If we enter into
any restructuring activities in the future, the adoption of SFAS 146 may affect
the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amount
recognized under such costs.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN 45 requires certain
guarantees to be recorded at fair value, which is different from current
practice, where a liability is recorded when a loss is probable and reasonably
estimable. In addition, FIN 45 also requires a guarantor to make significant
new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the
guarantee is remote, which is another change from current practice. FIN 45 is
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial
statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. We
have adopted the disclosure requirements in FIN 45 regarding warranties herein
this annual report (see Note 7 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8). We are currently evaluating the other requirements of
FIN 45. If it is determined that the other requirements of FIN 45 apply to us,
revenues, cost of goods sold and or operating expenses could be negatively
affected.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS 148 amends SFAS
123 to provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS 123’s fair value
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also
amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 and APB No. 28, “Interim Financial
Reporting,” to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting
policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to
stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share
in annual and interim financial statements. While SFAS 148 does not amend SFAS
123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair
value method, the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 are applicable to all
companies with stock-based employee compensation, regardless of whether they
account for that compensation using the fair value method of SFAS 123 or the
intrinsic value method of APB 25. Since we account for our stock-based
compensation under APB 25, and have no current plans on switching to SFAS 123,
the impact of SFAS 148 will be limited to the annual and interim reporting of
the effects on net income and earnings per share as if we accounted for
stock-based compensation under SFAS 123. SFAS 148 is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2002.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”), an interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements.” FIN 46
establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity
(“VIE”), formerly referred to as special purpose entities. FIN 46 applies to
any business enterprise, both public and private, that has a controlling
interest, contractual relationship or other business relationship with a VIE.
FIN 46 provides guidance for determining when an entity (the “Primary
Beneficiary”) should consolidate another entity, a VIE, that functions to
support the activities of the Primary Beneficiary. We



currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship
with a VIE and therefore the adoption will not have an effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Risk Factors

Set forth below and elsewhere in this Report and in other documents we
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results
contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report.

We face intense competition that could reduce our market share.

Competition
in the network infrastructure market is intense. This market
has historically been dominated by Cisco with other companies such as Nortel
Networks and Lucent Technologies providing products to a smaller segment of the
market. In addition, a number of other small public or private companies have
announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our
products address.

If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future
competitors from a product offering standpoint or from potential price
competition by such competitors, we could experience a loss in market share
and/or be required to reduce prices, resulting in reduced gross margins, either
of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results
and financial condition.

The current economic conditions, combined with the financial condition of
some of our customers, limit our visibility and makes revenue forecasting
difficult.

The continuing economic downturn generally, and in the telecommunication
industry specifically, combined with our own relatively limited operating
history in the context of such a continuing economic downturn, makes it
difficult to accurately forecast revenue.

We have experienced and expect, in the foreseeable future, to continue to
experience limited visibility into our customers’ spending plans and capital
budgets. This limited visibility complicates our revenue forecasting process.
Additionally, many customers funded their network infrastructure purchases
through a variety of debt and similar instruments and many of these same
customers are carrying a significant debt burden and are experiencing reduced
cash flow with which to carry the cost of the debt and the corresponding
interest charges, which reduces their ability to both justify and make future
purchases. The telecommunications industry has experienced consolidation and
rationalization of its participants and we expect this trend to continue.
There have been adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt
markets for telecommunications industry participants, which have affected their
ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures. In some cases the
significant debt burden carried by these customers has reduced their ability to
pay for the purchases made to date. This has contributed, and we expect it to
continue to contribute, to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of capital
expenditures, further limiting visibility and complicating the forecasting
process. Certain of these customers have filed for bankruptcy as a result of
their debt burdens. Although these customers generally expect that they will
emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings in the future, a bankruptcy proceeding
can be a slow and cumbersome process further limiting the visibility and
complicating the revenue forecasting process as to these customers. Even if they should emerge from such proceedings, the extent and timing of
any future purchases of equipment is uncertain. This uncertainty will further
complicate the revenue forecasting process.

In addition, our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated
revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are, and will continue to
be, fixed in the short-term. If we do not achieve our expected revenues, the
operating results will be below our expectations and those of investors and
market analysts, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.



Our failure to increase our revenues may prevent us from being profitable
in future periods.

We have large fixed expenses and net revenues have declined over the past
year. There can be no assurances that net revenues will grow or that we will
be profitable in future periods.

Although our customer base has increased substantially, there are still a
limited number of customers who comprise a significant portion of our revenues
and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect.

Even though our customer base has increased substantially, we expect that
a large portion of our net revenues will continue to depend on sales to a
limited number of customers. Any downturn in the business of these customers
or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers
that could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations.

We rely on distribution partners to sell our products, and disruptions to
these channels could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the
sale of our products.

We believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing
successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners. We have
entered into agreements with several value added resellers, some of which also
sell products that compete with our products. We cannot be certain that we
will be able to retain or attract resellers on a timely basis or at all, or
that the resellers will devote adequate resources to selling our products.

Our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software
or hardware errors, our business could be adversely impacted.

Our products are highly technical and are designed to be deployed in very
large and complex networks. Certain of our products can only be fully tested
when deployed in networks that generate high amounts of data and/or voice
traffic. As a result, we may experience errors in connection with such product
and for new products and enhancements. Any defects or errors in our products
discovered in the future could result in loss of or delay in revenue, loss of
customers, increased service and warranty cost all of which could adversely
impact our business and our results of operations.

If our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks,
installations will be delayed or cancelled and could result in substantial
product returns, which could harm our business.

Our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing
networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple
protocol standards. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple
generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have
grown and evolved. Our products must interoperate with all of the products
within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our
customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software used in
our customers’ networks, we must modify our software to fix or overcome these
errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing
software and hardware. If our products do not interoperate with those of our
customers’ networks, installations could be delayed, orders for our products
could be cancelled or our products could be returned. This would also damage
our reputation, which could seriously harm our business and prospects.

Problems arising from use of our products in conjunction with other
vendors’ products could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.

Service providers typically use our products in conjunction with products
from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur, it may be difficult to
identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur
significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering
personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer
relations problems.



Traditional telecommunications companies generally require more onerous
terms and conditions of their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to
such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may
have an adverse impact on our business.

Traditional telecommunications companies because of their size generally
have had greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received
more favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous terms and
conditions for their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to this class
of customer, we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may
include terms that impact our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse
effect on our business and financial condition.

In addition, many of this class of customer have purchased products from
other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such
functionality and/or had products that caused problems and outages in the
networks of these customers. As a result, this class of customer may request
additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to
deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network
outages that may be caused by our products. These additional requests and
penalties, if we are required to agree to them, may impact our ability to
recognize the revenue from such sales, which may negatively impact our business
and our financial condition.

Our success depends on our ability to anticipate market needs and to
develop products and product enhancements that will meet those needs and gain
market acceptance.

We cannot ensure that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or
that we will be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet
such needs or to meet them in a timely manner. If we fail to anticipate the
market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet
those needs, such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and
sales of our present and future products, which would significantly harm our
business and financial results. Even if we are able to anticipate and develop
and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, there can be no
assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market
acceptance. Any failure of our future products to achieve market acceptance
could adversely affect the business and financial results.

We depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly
changing market and if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel, our
ability to develop, market and sell products could be harmed.

Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive
officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing and support personnel.
None of the officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for
any specific term.

The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to
attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring
required personnel, particularly engineers, could delay the development and
introduction of and negatively impact our ability to develop, market or sell
our products.

In addition, although we completed the acquisition of Unisphere on July 1,
2002, integration of the products, product roadmap and operations is a
continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future. As a result of
these activities, we may lose opportunities and employees, which could disrupt
our business and harm our financial results.

If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could
incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays.

Our contract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products for any
specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price, except as
may be provided in a particular purchase order because we do not have long-term
supply contracts with them. In addition, lead times for required materials and
components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific
supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. We
provide to our contract manufacturers a



demand forecast. If we overestimate our requirements, the contract
manufacturers may assess charges that could negatively impact our gross margins
(as was the case for the quarter ended September 30, 2001). If we
underestimate our requirements, the contract manufacturers may have inadequate
inventory, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in
delays in shipments and revenues.

We currently depend on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have
long-term supply contracts, and changes to those relationships, expected or
unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose
revenue and damage our customer relationships.

We depend on third party contract manufacturers (each of whom is a third
party manufacturer for numerous companies) to manufacture our products. We do
not have a long-term supply contract with such manufacturers and if we should
fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or
more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems
in its manufacturing operations, our ability to ship products to our customers
could be delayed which could adversely affect our business and financial
results.

In connection with the acquisition of Unisphere we added a third contract
manufacturer and as part of the integration activities we are consolidating our
contract manufacturing at two of the three current contract manufacturers. The
transition from three to two contract manufacturers may result in disruptions
or quality control problems in manufacturing operations, delays in our ability
to ship products to our customers all of which could adversely affect our
business and financial results. The transition is expected to be completed by
the end of the first quarter of 2003, however, this transition could be delayed
be a number of factors, including, but not limited to, systems integration,
economic conditions and process planning.

Further, Unisphere received semi-finished goods from its contract
manufacturer and engaged in final test and assembly of finished product at its
facility in Westford, Massachusetts. As a result, Unisphere carried inventory
on its books. As part of the integration of Unisphere we are outsourcing those
activities to be consistent with our full-outsource model. If we should fail
to effectively manage these activities we could experience disruptions or
quality control problems or delays in shipments to our customers, all of which
could adversely impact our business and financial results.

The long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well as our
expectation that customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead
times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from
quarter to quarter.

A customer’s decision to purchase our products involves a significant
commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification
process. As a result, the sales cycle may be lengthy. Throughout the sales
cycle, we often spend considerable time educating and providing information to
prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products. Even
after making the decision to purchase, customers tend to deploy the products
slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on
the skill set of the customer, the size of the network deployment, the
complexity of the customer’s network environment and the degree of hardware and
software configuration necessary to deploy the products. Customers with large
networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis.
Accordingly, we expect to receive purchase orders for significant dollar
amounts on an irregular basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation
that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead
times, may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and
unexpectedly from quarter to quarter.

We face risks associated with our restructuring plans that may adversely
affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

In response to industry and market conditions, we have restructured our
business and reduced our workforce. The assumptions underlying our
restructuring efforts will be assessed on an ongoing basis and may prove to be
inaccurate and we may have to restructure our business again in the future to
achieve certain cost savings and to strategically realign our resources.



Our restructuring plan is based on certain assumptions regarding the cost
structure of our business and the nature, severity, and duration of the current
industry adjustment, which may not prove to be accurate. While restructuring,
we have assessed, and will continue to assess, whether we should further reduce
our workforce, as well as review the recoverability of our tangible and
intangible assets, including the land purchased in January 2001. Any such
decisions may result in the recording of additional charges, such as workforce
reduction costs, facilities reduction costs, asset write-downs, and contractual
settlements.

Additionally, estimates and assumptions used in asset valuations are
subject to uncertainties, as are accounting estimates with respect to the
useful life and ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets,
including goodwill and other intangible assets. As a result, future market
conditions may result in further charges for the write down of tangible and
intangible assets.

We may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have
undertaken in restructuring our business and, even if successfully implemented,
these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and
market conditions and to achieve future profitability. Furthermore, our
workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future
business objectives. Lastly, costs actually incurred in connection with
restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions
and/or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings. As a result, our
restructuring efforts may not result in our return to profitability.

We could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property
rights, which could seriously harm the business.

In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United
States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Although we
are not involved in any intellectual property litigation, we may be a party to
litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of
an alleged infringement of others’ intellectual property. Claims for alleged
infringement and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to
significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights
and may require us to stop selling, incorporating or using products that use
the challenged intellectual property. These lawsuits, regardless of their
success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would
divert management time and attention.

Necessary licenses of third-party technology may not be available to us or
may be very expensive.

We integrate third-party licensed technology in certain of our products.
From time to time we may be required to license additional technology from
third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. Third-party
licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially
reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third party
licenses required in our current products or our inability to obtain
third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product
enhancements, could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality
or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could seriously
harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is subject to risks from global operations.

We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries
outside of the United States and also depend on our contract manufacturers’
manufacturing operations, which are located within and outside of the United
States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected
by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others,
political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or
region; trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may
affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries; and
difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Any or all of
these factors could adversely impact our business and financial results.



We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the
United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in non-US currency
exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices
evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and
cash flows.

The majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in US Dollars. We
also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies,
primarily the Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, British Pound and the Euro,
related to our sale and service operations outside of the United States. An
increase in the value of the US Dollar could increase the real cost to our
customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we
sell in US Dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local
operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must
purchase components in foreign currencies.

Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain
assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically
will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. The hedging activities
undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on
certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. Our attempts to hedge
against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our
net income.

Any acquisition we make could disrupt the business and harm our financial
condition.

We have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments in
order to enhance our business. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including
problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products,
unanticipated costs, diversion of management’s attention from our core
business, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and
customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or
limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses,
products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire.

We intend to make investments in complementary companies, products or
technologies. In the event of any such investments or acquisitions, we could
issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership,
incur debt, assume liabilities, incur amortization expenses related to
purchases of intangible assets, or incur large and immediate write-offs.

We are a party to lawsuits, which, if determined adversely to us, could
result in the imposition of damages against us and could harm our business and
financial condition.

We and certain of our former officers and current and former members of
our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits brought by classes of
stockholders alleging, among other things, violations of federal and state
securities laws breach of various fiduciary obligations. There can be no
assurance that actions that have been or will be brought against us will be
resolved in our favor. Any losses resulting from these claims could adversely
affect our profitability and cash flow.

The unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the
trading price of our common stock.

Our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to
quarter due to a number of factors, including many of which are outside of our
control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate.

The factors that may impact the unpredictability of our quarterly results
include the reduced visibility into customers’ spending plans, the changing
market conditions, which have resulted in some customer and potential customer
bankruptcies, a change in the mix of our products sold, from higher priced core
products to lower priced edge products, and long sales and implementation
cycle. As a result, we believe



that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating results are not a good
indication of future performance. It is likely that in some future quarters,
operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors in which case the price of our common stock may fall.

Our stock price has been volatile and could decline substantially.

The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the
past, will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline. Among
the factors that could affect our stock price are:

We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several
key components.

With the current demand for electronic products, component shortages are
possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be
limited. We currently purchase several key components, including ASICs, from
single or limited sources. We may not be able to develop an alternate or
second source in a timely manner, which could hurt our ability to deliver
product to customers. If we are unable to buy these components on a timely
basis, we will not be able to deliver product to our customers, which would
seriously impact present and future sales, which would, in turn, adversely
affect our business.

If we fail to adequately evolve our systems and processes in a changing
business environment, our ability to manage our business and results of
operations may be negatively impacted.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business
plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management
process. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and
managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to
continue to evolve our systems and processes, our ability to manage our
business and results of operations may be negatively impacted.

Our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the
Internet and Internet-based systems; changes in industry structure could lead
to product discontinuances.

A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of the
Internet and on the deployment of our product by customers that depend on the
continued growth of the Internet. As a result of the economic slowdown and the
reduction in capital spending, which have particularly affected
telecommunications service providers, spending on Internet infrastructure has
declined, which has had a material adverse effect on our business. To the
extent that the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to
adversely affect spending on Internet infrastructure, we could continue to
experience material adverse effects on our business, operating results and
financial condition.



We face risks from the uncertainties of regulation of the
telecommunications industry as well as the Internet and commerce over the
Internet.

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and
financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the
regulations relating to the telecommunications industry. Also, there are few
laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on the
Internet. We could be adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and
Internet commerce in any country where we operate. Such regulations could
include matters such as voice over the Internet or using Internet Protocol,
encryption technology, and access charges for Internet service providers. The
adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could decrease
demand for our products, and at the same time increase the cost of selling our
products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
result and financial condition.

ITEM 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and
maturities. These securities are generally classified as available-for-sale
and, consequently, are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value
with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss).

At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact
on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in
interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our
investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures.

The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of the
financial instruments held at December 31, 2002 that are sensitive to changes
in interest rates (in thousands):

These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than
trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value
arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes
reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or
minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of
the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate.

Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts.

The majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in US dollars.
However, since we have sales and service operations outside of the US, we do
have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily
the Euro, Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, British Pound and the Australian
Dollar.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and
liabilities denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and
Australian Dollar. These derivatives are not designated as hedges under SFAS
No. 133 (“SFAS 133”), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” At December 31,



2002, the notional and fair values of these contracts were not material.
We do not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a material impact
on our financial results.

We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency
forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses, denominated
primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Australian Dollar.
These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. At
December 31, 2002, the notional and fair values of these contracts were not
material. We do not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Juniper
Networks, Inc. as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Juniper Networks,
Inc. at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, present fairly in all material respect the information set forth
therein.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for
goodwill. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of Business

Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks” or the “Company”) is a leading
provider of network infrastructure solutions that transform the business of
networking by converting bandwidth into a dependable, secure and highly
valuable corporate asset. The Company was founded in 1996 to develop and sell
products that would meet the stringent demands of service providers. The
world’s leading network operators, government agencies, research and education
institutions, and information intensive enterprises now rely upon Juniper
Networks as the foundation for uncompromising networks. The Company sells and
markets its products through its direct sales organization and value-added
resellers.

In July 2002, Juniper Networks completed its acquisition of Unisphere
Networks, Inc. (“Unisphere”), a subsidiary of Siemens Corporation (“Siemens”).
Following the acquisition and during the remainder of 2002, Siemens
A.G., itself and through its local country affiliates, was one of
the Company’s significant resellers. Unisphere developed, manufactured and
sold data networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of
service provider networks. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations,” the Company has
included in its results of operations for 2002, the results of Unisphere from
July 1, 2002.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Juniper
Networks and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Investments in which the Company intends to
maintain more than a temporary 20% to 50% interest, or otherwise has the
ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity
method. Investments in which the Company has less than 20% interest and/or
does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the
lower of cost or estimated realizable value.

Use of Estimates and Reclassifications

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to establish accounting policies which
contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These policies
include:

•

revenue recognition;

•

the allowance for doubtful accounts, which impacts general and administrative expenses;

•

the valuation of exposures associated with the contract
manufacturing operations and estimating future warranty costs, which
impacts cost of product revenues and gross margins; and

•

the initial and continuing valuation of certain long-term
assets, especially goodwill and other purchased intangible assets,
which could result in an impairment, which would impact operating
expenses.

The Company has other equally important accounting policies and practices;
however, once adopted, these other policies either generally do not require
management to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only
require implementation of the adopted policy not a judgment as to policy
itself. Despite the Company’s intention to establish accurate estimates and
assumptions, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition,
certain amounts that were previously reported have been reclassified to conform
to the current period presentation.



Cash and Cash Equivalents

Juniper Networks considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist
of money market funds, commercial paper, government securities, certificates of
deposit, and corporate debt securities.

Equity Investments

Juniper Networks has certain minority equity investments in privately held
companies. These investments are included in other long-term assets in the
consolidated balance sheets and are carried at cost, adjusted for any
impairment, as the Company owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not
have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. As of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, the carrying values of the Company’s minority
equity investments in privately held companies were $5.0 million and $49.3
million, respectively. These investments are inherently high risk as the
market for technologies or products manufactured by these companies are usually
early stage at the time of the investment by Juniper Networks and such markets
may never be significant. The Company could lose its entire investment in
certain or all of these companies. The Company monitors these investments for
impairment by considering financial, operational and economic data and makes
appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

In addition to the equity investments in privately held companies, the
Company holds certain marketable securities classified as available-for-sale.
These securities are reported at fair value as of the balance sheet dates, with
any unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholders’ equity. Realized
gains or losses and declines in value determined to be other than temporary, if
any, on available-for-sale securities are reported in other income or expense
as incurred.

The following table summarizes the impairment charges associated with
equity investments recorded by the Company (in thousands):

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable approximates fair market value due to the relatively short period of
time to maturity. See Note 6 “Cash Equivalents, Short-Term and Long-Term
Investments” for a discussion on the carrying values of our investment
portfolio. The fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes Due
March 15, 2007 (the “Notes”) is based upon quoted market rates. The carrying
amounts and fair value of the Notes were (in thousands):

See Note

Concentrations

Financial instruments that subject Juniper Networks to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and
trade accounts receivable. Juniper Networks maintains its cash and cash
equivalents and investments in fixed income securities with high-quality
institutions and only invests in high quality credit instruments. Deposits
held with banks may exceed the amount of



insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be
redeemed upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk. Part of the Company’s
investment portfolio includes minority equity investments in publicly traded
companies, the values of which are subject to significant market price
volatility. Generally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company’s customer
base and their dispersion across different geographic locations throughout the
world. Juniper Networks performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. Juniper
Networks maintains reserves for potential credit losses and historically, such
losses have been within management’s expectations.

The Company’s net revenues for 2002 were derived from the sale of all of
its products, including all five products that were sold during 2001, plus the
G-series, E-series and J-series products as well as new platforms in the
T-series. The G-series products are Cable Modem Termination System (“CMTS”)
products that were developed using the technology acquired through the
acquisition of Pacific Broadband Communications. The J-series was developed
with Ericsson A.B. through our joint venture to serve the wireless service
provider space. The E-series product was acquired through the acquisition of
Unisphere. The net revenues for 2001 and 2000 were derived from the sale of
five M-series products. For 2002, one customer accounted for 17% of net
product revenues, compared to 2001, where three customers each accounted for
14%, 13% and 11% of net product revenues and 2000 where one customer accounted
for 18% of net product revenues. Sales outside of the United States accounted
for 51%, 36% and 35% of net revenues for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Juniper Networks relies on sole suppliers for certain of its components
such as ASICs and custom sheet metal. Additionally, Juniper Networks relies on
three independent contract manufacturers for the production of all of its
products. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to fulfill supply
requirements of Juniper Networks could negatively impact future operating
results.

Derivatives

Juniper Networks enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to
mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain assets and
liabilities denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and
Australian Dollar. These derivatives are not designated as hedges under SFAS
No. 133 (“SFAS 133”), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” For the year ended December 31, 2002, these activities were
insignificant. The Company does not expect gains and losses on these contracts
to have a material impact on its financial results.

Juniper Networks also uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge
foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses,
denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Australian
Dollar. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133.
For the year ended December 31, 2002, these activities were insignificant. The
Company does not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a material
impact on its financial results.

These contracts have original maturities ranging from one to three months.
The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or
trading purposes.

Juniper Networks did not hold any derivative instruments and did not
engage in hedging activities during 2001 and 2000.

For currency forward contracts, effectiveness of the hedge is measured
using spot rates for all strategies to value the forward contract and the
underlying hedged transaction.

Any ineffective portions of the hedge, as well as amounts not included in
the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized currently in interest income or
expense. If a cash flow hedge were to be discontinued because it is probable
that the original hedged transaction will not occur as anticipated, the
unrealized gains or losses would be reclassified into earnings. Subsequent
gains or losses on the related derivative instrument would be recognized in
income in each period until the instrument matures, is terminated or is sold.



During 2002 the portion of hedging instruments’ gains or losses excluded
from the assessment of effectiveness and the ineffective portions of hedges had
an insignificant impact on earnings. There was no significant impact to
results of operations from discontinued cash flow hedges as a result of
forecasted transactions that did not occur.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to US dollars
using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and expenses
are translated using average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency
translation gains and losses were not material for the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the lesser of
the estimated useful life, generally three to five years, or the lease term of
the respective assets. The land that was acquired in January 2001 for the
future corporate campus (the “Land”) is not being depreciated. Property and
equipment consist of the following (in thousands):

Depreciation expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $41.6 million, $24.3
million and $11.0 million, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized a
charge of approximately $5.3 million during 2002 for costs of exiting certain
contractual obligations associated with the Land. The Company has no plans to
continue to develop the Land in the foreseeable future.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization. The Company adopted SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” on January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 prohibits the amortization of
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. For business
combinations consummated before July 1, 2001, goodwill was amortized through
December 31, 2001, using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life
of three years. Goodwill is not amortized for business combinations
consummated after June 30, 2001. Goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Amortization
of purchased intangibles with finite useful lives is computed using the
straight-line method over the expected useful life of two to six years. See
Note 3, “Acquisitions,” for detail of the acquisitions where the Company
acquired goodwill and intangible assets and Note 4, “Goodwill and Purchased
Intangible Assets,” for detail of the activity in these accounts during 2002
and 2001.

Revenue Recognition

Juniper Networks recognizes product revenue in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.” Specifically, product revenue is recognized when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, unless the Company has
future obligations for such



things as network interoperability or customer acceptance, in which case
revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met. In
most cases, the Company recognizes product revenue upon shipment to its
customers, including resellers, as it is the Company’s policy and practice to
ensure an end user has been identified prior to shipment to a reseller.

Juniper Networks also recognizes revenue from service contracts. A vast
majority of the Company’s service revenue is earned from customers who have
purchased its products. Service revenue contracts are typically for one-year
periods and are for services such as 24-hour customer support, non-specified
updates, hardware repairs and consulting services. In addition to service
contracts, the Company also provides professional and educational services.
Service revenue is deferred until the services commence, at which point the
service revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the obligation.

Amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred
revenue and accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The Company accrues for sales returns and other allowances based on
its best estimate of future returns and other allowances.

Research and Development

Costs to develop the Company’s products are expensed as incurred in
accordance with SFAS No. 2, “Accounting for Research and Development Costs,”
which establishes accounting and reporting standards for research and
development.

Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred
and the totals have been insignificant to date. Marketing development
obligations for customers are charged to sales and marketing expense in the
period the related revenue is recognized and the totals have been insignificant
to date.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has employee stock benefit plans, which are described more
fully in Note 10, “Stockholders’ Equity.” The Company’s stock option plans are
accounted for under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles
of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
Interpretations. As the exercise price of all options granted under these
plans was equal to the market price of the underlying common stock on the grant
date, no stock-based employee compensation cost, other than acquisition-related
compensation, is recognized in net income. The following table illustrates the
effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” to employee stock benefits, including shares issued under the
stock option plans and under the Company’s Stock Purchase Plan, collectively
called “options.” Pro forma information, net of the tax effect, follows (in

Comprehensive Loss

Under SFAS 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” the Company is required
to display comprehensive income (loss) and its components as part of the
financial statements. The Company has displayed its comprehensive income
(loss) as part of the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Other
comprehensive loss for 2002 includes net unrealized losses on
available-for-sale securities and net foreign currency translation losses that
are excluded from net loss. See Note 14 “Comprehensive Income (Loss)” for a
discussion on the changes and components of comprehensive income (loss).

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with an Exit or Disposal Activity.” SFAS
No. 146 revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under Emerging
Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including
Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring),” by spreading out the reporting of
expenses related to restructuring activities. A commitment to a plan to exit
an activity or dispose of long-lived assets will no longer be sufficient to
record a one-time charge for most restructuring activities. Instead, companies
will record exit or disposal costs when they are “incurred” and can be measured
at fair value. In addition, the resultant liabilities will be subsequently
adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows. SFAS No. 146 is effective
prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31,
2002. Companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the
effect of the provisions of SFAS No. 146, and liabilities that a company
previously recorded under EITF Issue 94-3 are grandfathered. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. If the Company enters into any
restructuring activities in the future, the adoption of SFAS 146 may affect the
timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amount
recognized under such costs.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value,
which is different from current practice, where a liability is recorded when a
loss is probably and reasonably estimable. In addition, FIN 45 also requires a
guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of
making any payments under the guarantee is remote, which is another change from
current practice. In general, FIN 45 applies to contracts or indemnification
agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the
guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset,
liability, or an equity security of the guaranteed party. FIN 45 is applicable
on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of
interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. Juniper Networks is
currently evaluating the impact of FIN 45. If FIN 45 is applicable to the
Company, revenues, cost of goods sold and or operating expenses could be
negatively affected. Juniper Networks has adopted the disclosure requirements
in FIN 45 regarding warranties herein this annual report (see Note 7).

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS 148 amends SFAS
123 to provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS 123’s fair value
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also
amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 and APB No. 28, “Interim Financial
Reporting,” to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting
policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to
stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share
in annual and interim financial statements. While SFAS 148 does not amend SFAS
123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair
value method, the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 are applicable to all
companies with stock-based employee compensation, regardless of whether they
account for that compensation using the fair value method of SFAS 123 or the
intrinsic value method of APB 25. Since Juniper Networks accounts for its
stock-based compensation under APB 25, and has no current plans on switching to
SFAS 123, the impact of SFAS 148 will be limited to the annual and interim
reporting of the effects on net income and earnings per share if the Company



accounted for stock-based compensation under SFAS 123. SFAS 148 is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”), an interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements.” FIN 46
establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity
(“VIE”), formerly referred to as special purpose entities. FIN 46 applies to
any business enterprise, both public and private, that has a controlling
interest, contractual relationship or other business relationship with a VIE.
FIN 46 provides guidance for determining when an entity (the “Primary
Beneficiary”) should consolidate another entity, a VIE, that functions to
support the activities of the Primary Beneficiary. The Company currently has
no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a VIE and
therefore the adoption will not have an effect on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Note 3. Acquisitions

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, Juniper Networks allocates the purchase
price of its business acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as in-process research and
development, based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price
over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair values assigned to
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on
estimates and assumptions provided by management, and other information
compiled by management, including valuations that utilize established valuation
techniques appropriate for the high technology industry. Goodwill recorded as
a result of these acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for tax
purposes.

Unisphere Business Combination

In July 2002, Juniper Networks completed its acquisition of 100% of
Unisphere, a subsidiary of Siemens. The acquisition of Unisphere will enable
Juniper Networks to supply edge applications expertise to the leading service
providers, carriers, and postal, telegraph and telephone providers (PTTs)
throughout the world. The acquisition resulted in the payment of $375.0
million of cash and the issuance of 36.5 million shares of Juniper Networks’
common stock with a fair value of approximately $359.9 million to the former
stockholders of Unisphere. The common stock issued in the acquisition was
valued using the average closing price of Juniper Networks’ common stock from
two days before to two days after the date the transaction was announced.
Juniper Networks also assumed all of the outstanding stock options of Unisphere
with a fair value of approximately $151.2 million. The options were valued
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the inputs of 0.8 for
volatility, 2 years for expected life, 4% for the risk-free interest rate and a
market value of $9.86 per share as described above. The Company also incurred
direct costs associated with the acquisition of approximately $13.6 million and
an estimated liability of approximately $14.8 million, consisting primarily of
workforce reduction charges, including severance and other employee benefits
for 90 individuals, costs of vacating duplicate facilities and the cost of
exiting certain contractual obligations. Below is a summary of the total

purchase price.

The purchase price allocation depicted is preliminary and subject to
change when the Company obtains additional information concerning certain
contingencies of Unisphere.

Amortizable Intangible Assets

Of the total purchase price, approximately $74.0 million has been
allocated to amortizable intangible assets, including completed technology,
service contract relationships, non-compete agreements and order backlog.
Completed technology, which consists of products that have reached
technological feasibility, includes products in Unisphere’s product line,
principally the ERX product. Service contract relationships represent the
potential additional source of revenue from customers with existing service
contracts. Both completed technology and the service contract relationships
were valued using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. This method
calculates the value of the intangible asset as being the present value of the
after tax cash flows potentially attributable to it, net of the return on fair
value attributable to tangible and other intangible assets. Juniper Networks
is amortizing the fair value of the completed technology and service contract
relationships on a straight-line basis over weighted average remaining useful
lives of approximately 5 years and 6 years, respectively.

Non-compete agreements represent the value of the non-compete and
non-solicit agreements signed by key executives from Unisphere. The
non-compete agreements were valued using the lost profits method, which
estimates the value of the future cash flows that would be lost due to customer
defections. The non-solicit agreements were valued using the avoided cost
method, which estimates the avoided costs of replacing solicited employees.
Juniper Networks is amortizing the fair value of these assets on a
straight-line basis over a weighted average useful life of approximately 2
years.

Order backlog represents the value of the standing orders for both
products and services. The order backlog was valued using the avoided cost
method, which estimates the avoided selling expenses due to the fact that
Unisphere had firm purchase orders in place at the time of acquisition.
Juniper Networks amortized the fair value of these assets over the three-month
period ended September 30, 2002 to cost of product revenues.

In-process Research and Development

Of the total purchase price, approximately $82.7 million has been
allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in
the quarter ended September 30, 2002. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent
those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no
alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being
equivalent to a beta-phase working



prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development.
At the time of acquisition, Unisphere had multiple IPR&D efforts under way for
certain current and future product lines. These efforts included developing
new cards and modules for different bandwidths and various software
developments. The Company utilized the DCF method to value the IPR&D, using
rates ranging from 30% to 35%. In applying the DCF method, the value of the
acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash
flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is
associated, over the remaining economic life of the technology. To distinguish
between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash
flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues,
adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working
capital and other assets that provide value to the product lines. At the time
of acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts were 55%
complete and would be completed over the next six to twelve months. As of
December 31, 2002 these development efforts were 90% complete and estimate that
they will be completed over the next twelve months.

Deferred Compensation

Unvested stock options with an intrinsic value of approximately $0.5
million at the time of acquisition have been allocated to deferred compensation
in the purchase price allocation and are being amortized to expense using the
graded vesting method. Options assumed in conjunction with the acquisition had
exercise prices ranging from $5.65 to $14.73 per share, with a weighted average
exercise price of $5.81 per share and a weighted average remaining contractual
life of approximately 9 years. Juniper Networks assumed approximately 13.5
million vested options and approximately 12.5 million unvested options.

Pro Forma Results

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the
combined results of operations of Juniper Networks and Unisphere as if the
acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented. The
information in the 2002 unaudited amounts was derived from the audited
statement of operations of Juniper Networks for the year ended December 31,
2002 and the unaudited statement of operations of Unisphere for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2002. The information in the 2001 unaudited amounts was
derived from the audited statements of operations of Juniper Networks for the
year ended December 31, 2001 and the unaudited statement of operations of
Unisphere for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001. Adjustments of $(5.0)
million and $6.2 million have been made to the combined results of operations
for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, reflecting the
elimination of amortization of purchased intangibles, charges to cost of goods
sold for inventory write-ups and the valuation of the order backlog, IPR&D and
the net tax impact. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not
intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of
operations of Juniper Networks that would have been reported had the
acquisition been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken
as representative of the future consolidated results of operations of the
Company.

Asset Purchase

In 2002, Juniper Networks entered into a Note Purchase Agreement valued at
$2.5 million with third party lenders whereby Juniper Networks purchased
certain secured indebtedness of a private company (the “debtor”) held by the
lenders. The debtor defaulted on the indebtedness and, therefore, Juniper
Networks took possession of the underlying collateral, which included
approximately $1.7 million of fixed assets and approximately $0.8 million of
IPR&D. The Company treated these assets as being acquired in a transaction
other than a business combination in accordance with SFAS No. 142. The Company
capitalized the fixed assets and is depreciating them over their useful lives
and expensed the IPR&D upon acquisition.

Pacific Broadband Business Combination

On December 14, 2001, Juniper Networks acquired 100% of the outstanding
stock of privately held Pacific Broadband Communications, (“Pacific
Broadband”), a developer of standards-based next-generation cable modem
termination systems (CMTS) in which Juniper Networks previously held a minority
interest. As a result of the acquisition, Juniper Networks gained access into
the cable market of the new public network, a new market to Juniper Networks at
the time of acquisition. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on
the acquisition date. Since December 14, 2001, Pacific Broadband’s results of
operations have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

The initial purchase price, including the prior investment of $4.0
million, was approximately $148.3 million consisting of an exchange of
approximately 4,612,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value
of approximately $109.8 million, assumed stock options with a fair value of
approximately $30.5 million, and other acquisition related expenses of
approximately $4.0 million consisting of workforce reduction costs, excess
facilities costs, filing fees, as well as payments for professional fees. The
terms of the acquisition also included an earn-out provision, payable in shares
of the Company’s common stock, wherein the former stockholders and employee
option holders of Pacific Broadband could receive additional consideration of
up to $59.0 million, upon achieving certain product development milestones and
revenue targets during 2002. The fair value of the common stock given was
determined using the average market price of the Company’s common stock over
the period including two days before and after the terms of the acquisition
were agreed to and announced. The fair value of the options given was
determined using the Black-Scholes option model.

acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (in thousands):

The $4.2 million assigned to research and development assets was written
off as in-process research and development at the date of acquisition in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4 “Applicability of FASB Statement No.
2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method.” The
applications from the in-process technology project have been integrated into
Juniper Networks’ products. The efforts required to complete the acquired
in-process technology included the completion of all planning, designing and
testing activities that were necessary to establish that the product can be
produced to meet its design requirements, including functions, features and
technical performance requirements. The value of the acquired in-process
technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis rate of 30% on
the anticipated income stream of the related product revenues. The discounted
cash flow analysis was based on management’s forecast of future revenues, cost
of revenues, and operating expenses related to the products and technologies
purchased from Pacific Broadband. The calculation of value was then adjusted
to reflect only the value creation efforts of Pacific Broadband prior to the
close of the acquisition. At the time of the acquisition, the product was
approximately 75% complete. The majority of the costs to complete the project
was incurred in 2002 and was not material. The resultant value of in-process
technology was further reduced by the estimated value of core technology. The
project was complete as of December 31, 2002.

The fair value of the intangible assets was determined based upon a
valuation using a combination of methods, including an income approach for the
core technology and a cost approach for the supply agreements. The goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net
tangible and intangible assets acquired, none of which is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. In accordance with SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 goodwill
was not and will not be amortized. The deferred compensation charge relates to
the intrinsic value of unvested stock options and restricted stock assumed in
the transaction. The deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of
stockholders’ equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the
applicable options or restricted stock using the graded vesting method.

Under the terms of the Pacific Broadband acquisition, there was an
earn-out provision, payable in shares of the Company’s common stock, wherein
the former stockholders and employee option holders of Pacific Broadband could
receive additional consideration of up to $59.0 million upon achieving certain
product development milestones and revenue targets during 2002. The milestones
achieved to date have a value of $16.5 million, all of which was recorded as
additional goodwill. There are no potential earn-out events remaining. In
addition to the increases in the value of the goodwill acquired through the
Pacific Broadband acquisition, the goodwill was reduced by $4.9 million for
certain liabilities that were accrued for at the time of acquisition that were
not realized.

Micro Magic Business Combination

On December 8, 2000, Juniper Networks acquired Micro Magic, Inc., (“Micro
Magic”), an integrated circuit solutions company. The acquisition was accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the purchase price
was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Since December 8, 2000, Micro
Magic’s results of operations have been included in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The fair value



of the intangible assets was determined based upon a valuation using a
combination of methods, including a cost approach for the assembled workforce
and an income approach for the core technology.

The purchase price of approximately $259.3 million consisted of an
exchange of approximately 828,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with a
fair value of approximately $125.7 million, assumed stock options with a fair
value of approximately $93.5 million, approximately $40.0 million in cash, and
other acquisition related expenses of approximately $150,000 consisting of
payments for professional fees. Of the total purchase price, approximately
$1.9 million was allocated to the net tangible assets acquired, approximately
$121.7 million was recorded as deferred compensation, and the remainder was
allocated to intangible assets, including in-process technology of $10.0
million, core technology of $7.3 million, assembled workforce of $900,000 and
goodwill of approximately $117.5 million. The fair value of the common stock
given was determined using the average market price of Juniper Networks’ common
shares over the period including two days before and after the terms of the
acquisition were agreed to and announced. The basis of determining the fair
value of the options given was the Black-Scholes method. The deferred
compensation charge relates to the intrinsic value of unvested stock options
and restricted stock assumed in the transaction. The applications from the
in-process technology project have been integrated into Juniper Networks’
products. The efforts required to complete the acquired in-process technology
included the completion of all planning, designing and testing activities that
were necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design
requirements, including functions, features and technical performance
requirements.

The value of the acquired in-process technology was computed using a
discounted cash flow analysis rate of 19% on the anticipated income stream of
the related product revenues. The discounted cash flow analysis was based on
management’s forecast of future revenues, cost of revenues, and operating
expenses related to the products and technologies purchased from Micro Magic.
The calculation of value was then adjusted to reflect only the value creation
efforts of Micro Magic prior to the close of the acquisition. At the time of
the acquisition, the product was approximately 88% complete and the project was
completed in 2001. The resultant value of in-process technology was further
reduced by the estimated value of core technology and was expensed in the
period the transaction was consummated. The deferred compensation is presented
as a reduction of stockholders’ equity and is being amortized over the vesting
period of the applicable options or restricted stock using the graded vesting
method. The acquired intangible assets are being amortized over their
estimated useful lives of three years. From the date of acquisition through
the end of fiscal 2001, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method
over three years. Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill was no longer amortized,
in accordance with SFAS 142.

Note 4. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill
totaling $208.8 million as of January 1, 2002. The following table presents

an impairment analysis as of January 1, 2002 and again in November 2002 and
determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill at either time.
However, future goodwill impairment tests, which should include consideration
of the Company’s market capitalization in relation to its historical
stockholders’ equity, may result in a charge to earnings in periods ending
subsequent to December 31, 2002.

Note 5. Restructuring and Other Operating Charges

2002 Plans

During the third quarter of 2002, in connection with the acquisition of
Unisphere, Juniper Networks’ Board of Directors approved and management
initiated plans to restructure operations to eliminate certain duplicative
activities, focus on strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost
structure and better



align product and operating expenses with existing general economic
conditions. Consequently, Juniper Networks recorded restructuring expenses of
approximately $14.9 million, net of a $2.6 million adjustment for costs that
were not going to be incurred due to a change in estimate, associated primarily
with workforce related costs, costs of vacating duplicative facilities,
contract termination costs, non-inventory asset impairment charges and other
associated costs. The adjusted worldwide workforce reduction charge of $9.0
million related principally to the termination of 220 employees across many
regions, business functions and job classes. The Company expects to pay the
remaining balance of the severance accrual in the first half of 2003.
Non-inventory asset impairment of $0.9 million was primarily for long-lived
assets that were no longer needed as a result of the Unisphere acquisition.
Adjusted facility charges of $5.0 million consisted primarily of the cost of
vacating duplicate facilities and the impairment cost of certain leasehold
improvements. These costs are accounted for under EITF Issue No. 94-3 (“EITF
94-3”), “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and
Other Costs to Exit an Activity” and have been included as a charge to the
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.

The restructuring charges are based on Juniper Networks’ restructuring
plans that have been committed to by management. Changes to the estimates of
executing the currently approved plans of restructuring the Unisphere
organization will be recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill, if such
changes occur within one year of the acquisition, and any changes thereafter to
the estimated costs of restructuring the former Unisphere organization or any
similar changes to the costs of restructuring the Juniper Networks organization
will be reflected in Juniper Networks’ results of operations.

As of December 31, 2002, the balance of the accrued restructuring charge
recorded in conjunction with the restructuring of the Juniper Networks
organization in the third quarter of 2002 consisted of the following (in
thousands):

Amounts related to the net lease expense due to the consolidation of
facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2009. The
Company’s estimated costs to exit these facilities are based on available
commercial rates for potential subleases. The actual loss incurred in exiting
these facilities could be different from the Company’s estimates.

Juniper Networks also recorded approximately $14.8 million of similar
restructuring costs in connection with restructuring the Unisphere
organization. These costs are accounted for under EITF Issue No. 95-3 (“EITF
95-3”), “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with Purchase Business
Combinations.” These costs were recognized as a liability assumed in the
purchase business combination and included in the allocation of the cost to
acquire Unisphere and, accordingly, have been included as an increase to
goodwill. As of December 31, 2002, there was approximately $9.7 million
remaining to be paid, primarily for facilities, which will be paid over the
respective lease terms through 2009, and professional services.

Other

The Company recognized a charge of approximately $5.3 million during the
quarter ended September 30, 2002 related to the Land acquired in January 2001
located in Sunnyvale, California. The charge was primarily for costs of
exiting certain contractual obligations associated with the Land and was
included in operating expenses under “Restructuring and other.” The Company
has no plans to continue to develop the Land in the foreseeable future.



2001 Plans

In June 2001, Juniper Networks announced a restructuring program in an
effort to better align its business operations with the current market and
service provider industry conditions. The restructuring program included a
worldwide workforce reduction, consolidation of excess facilities and
restructuring of certain business functions. The costs associated with the
restructuring program totaled $12.3 million and were recorded during the three
months ended June 30, 2001 as operating expenses.

The Company recognized realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale
securities of $0.4 million, which is net of a $5.0 million impairment charge on
available-for-sale securities recognized in the quarter ended September 30,
2002 for declines in value that were deemed to be other than temporary, for
2002 and $5.5 million for 2001. The cost of a security sold is based on the
specific identification method.

Note 7. Warranties

Juniper Networks offers a one-year warranty on all of its hardware
products as well as a 90-day warranty on the software embedded in the products.
The warranty generally includes parts, labor and 24-hour service center
support. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties may vary
depending on the products sold and the locations into which they are sold. The
Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty obligations
and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is
recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the
number of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims
and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its
recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

Note 8. Commitments

Juniper Networks leases its facilities under operating leases that expire
at various times, the longest of which expires in 2014. Rental expense for
2002, 2001 and 2000, was approximately $17.1 million, $15.0 million and $5.1
million, respectively.

Note 9. Long-Term Debt

In March 2000, Juniper Networks received $1.12 billion of net proceeds
from the Notes offering of $1.15 billion. Interest on the Notes accrues at
4.75% per year and is payable on March 15 and September 15 each year in cash.
The convertible notes are subordinate in right of payment to all senior debt.
The Notes are convertible into shares of Juniper Networks common stock at any
time prior to maturity or their prior redemption or repurchase by Juniper
Networks. The conversion rate is 6.0992 shares per each $1,000 principal
amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
On or after the third business day after March 15, 2003, Juniper Networks has
the option to redeem the Notes at the following redemption prices (expressed as
percentages of principle amount):

100.679

In the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the Company paid approximately
$146.0 million to retire a portion of its Notes. This partial retirement
resulted in a gain of $62.9 million, which was the difference between the
carrying value of the Notes, including unamortized debt issuance costs, at the
time of their retirement and the amount paid to extinguish such Notes. The
Company is currently evaluating plans to retire additional Notes in the future;
therefore, the Company does not consider the gains associated with this
retirement to be extraordinary, based on the guidance in SFAS No. 145,
“Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 13, and Technical Corrections.”

Note 10. Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Repurchase

On December 6, 2000 Juniper Networks repurchased 1,000,000 shares of its
common stock at a cost of approximately $130.0 million. All shares repurchased
were subsequently reissued later in December 2000 with the difference between
the repurchase price and the re-issuance price charged to additional paid-in
capital.

Stock Option Plans

Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan

The Company’s Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan (the “1996
Plan”) provides for the granting of incentive stock options to employees and
nonstatutory stock options to employees, directors and consultants. Incentive
stock options are granted at an exercise price of not less than the fair value
per share of the common stock on the date of grant. Nonstatutory stock options
may be granted at an exercise price of not less than 85% of the fair value per
share on the date of grant; however, no nonstatutory stock options have been
granted for less than fair market value on the date of grant. Vesting and
exercise provisions are determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted
under the 1996 Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year period
beginning on the date of grant. Options granted



under the 1996 Plan have a maximum term of ten years. Options granted to
consultants are in consideration for the fair value of services previously
rendered, are not contingent upon future events and are expensed in the period
of grant. Juniper Networks has authorized 146,623,000 shares of common stock
for issuance under the 1996 Plan. At December 31, 2002, 35,919,000 shares were
available for future option grants or stock sales under the 1996 Plan.

The 1996 Plan also provides for the sale of shares of common stock to
employees and consultants at the fair value per share of the common stock.
Shares issued to consultants are for the fair value of services previously
rendered and are not contingent upon future events. Shares sold to employees
are made pursuant to restricted stock purchase agreements containing provisions
established by the Board of Directors. These provisions give Juniper Networks
the right to repurchase the shares at the original sales price upon termination
of the employee. This right expires at a rate determined by the Board of
Directors, generally at the rate of 25% after one year and 2.0833% per month
thereafter. No shares were issued under the 1996 Plan in 2002 and 2001. At
December 31, 2002 and 2001, 24,000 and 476,000 shares were subject to
repurchase rights under the 1996 Plan, respectively. At December 31, 2002 and
2001, 3,896,000 and 3,854,000 shares, respectively, had been repurchased under
the 1996 Plan in connection with employee terminations.

2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan

In July 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the Juniper Networks 2000
Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”). The 2000 Plan provides for
the granting of nonstatutory stock options to employees, directors and
consultants. Nonstatutory stock options may be granted at an exercise price of
not less than 85% of the fair value per share on the date of grant; however, no
nonstatutory stock options have been granted for less than fair market value on
the date of grant. Vesting and exercise provisions are determined by the Board
of Directors. Options granted under the 2000 Plan generally become exercisable
over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant. Options granted under
the 2000 Plan have a maximum term of ten years. Options granted to consultants
are in consideration for the fair value of services previously rendered, are
not contingent upon future events and are expensed in the period of grant. As
of December 31, 2002, Juniper Networks had authorized 44,362,000 shares of
common stock for issuance under the 2000 Plan. At December 31, 2002, 16,588,000
shares were available for future option grants under the 2000 Plan.

Micro Magic, Inc. 1995 Stock Option Plan and 2000 Stock Option Plan

In connection with the acquisition of Micro Magic, Inc. in December 2000,
the Company assumed all outstanding options under the Micro Magic, Inc. 1995
Stock Option Plan and the Micro Magic, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the “MMI Plans”). The MMI Plans have been terminated except
with respect to the options outstanding at the time of the acquisition.
Options under the MMI Plans generally become exercisable over a four-year
period beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of 10 years.
Juniper Networks has authorized an aggregate of 626,187 shares of common stock
for issuance under the MMI Plans. No shares are available for future option
grants under the MMI Plans. As of December 31, 2002, 183,000 shares were
outstanding under the MMI Plans.

Pacific Broadband Communications, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and 2000
Subplan

In connection with the acquisition of Pacific Broadband Communications,
Inc. (“PBC”) in December 2001, the Company assumed all outstanding options
under the PBC 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and 2000 Subplan (collectively, the
“PBC Plans”). Options under the PBC Plans generally become exercisable over a
four-year period beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of 10
years. Juniper Networks has authorized an aggregate of 1,443,374 shares of
common stock for issuance under the PBC Plans. No shares are available for
future option grants under the PBC Plans. As of December 31, 2002, 927,000
shares were outstanding under the PBC Plans.



Unisphere Networks, Inc. 1999 Stock Incentive Plan

In connection with the acquisition of Unisphere in July 2002, the Company
assumed all outstanding options under the Unisphere Amended and Restated 1999
Incentive Plan (the “Unisphere Plan”). Options under the Unisphere Plan
generally become exercisable over a four-year period beginning on the date of
grant and have a maximum term of 10 years. Juniper Networks has authorized an
aggregate of 26,051,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Unisphere
Plan. No shares are available for future option grants under the Unisphere
Plans. As of December 31, 2002, 17,615,000 shares were outstanding under the
Unisphere Plan.

Option activity under all option plans is summarized as follows:

Stock Option Exchange Program

On October 25, 2001, the Company announced a voluntary stock option
exchange program for its employees. Under the program, Juniper Networks
employees were given the opportunity, if they chose, to cancel certain
outstanding stock options previously granted to them with an exercise price
equal to or greater than $10.00 in exchange for an equal number of replacement
options to be granted at a future date, at least six months and one day from
the cancellation date, which was November 26, 2001. Options granted to certain
employees in two 50% increments in April 2001 and July 2001 were not eligible
for exchange and, if an employee who received such grants elected to
participate in the exchange program, those options were cancelled in their
entirety as a condition to exchanging eligible options for replacement options.
In addition, those employees electing to participate in the exchange program
were



required to exchange all options granted to such employees during the
six-month period prior to the cancellation date (except for those options
grants cancelled as described above). Under the exchange program, options for
23,827,037 shares of the Company’s common stock were tendered and canceled, of
which 21,054,076 were eligible for replacement option grants. Each participant
employee received, for each eligible option included in the exchange, a
one-for-one replacement option. The exercise price of each replacement option
was the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on date of grant. The
replacement options had terms and conditions that are substantially the same as
those of the canceled options. The exchange program did not result in any
additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In April 1999, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of Juniper
Networks 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan). A total of
3,000,000 shares of common stock were originally reserved for issuance under
the 1999 Purchase Plan, plus, commencing on January 1, 2000, annual increases
equal to the lesser of 3,000,000 shares, or 1% of the outstanding common shares
on such date or a lesser amount determined by the Board of Directors. The 1999
Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to acquire shares of the Company’s
common stock through periodic payroll deductions of up to 10% of base
compensation. Each employee may purchase no more than 6,000 shares in any
twelve-month period, and in no event, may an employee purchase more than
$25,000 worth of stock, determined at the fair market value of the shares at
the time such option is granted, in one calendar year. The Purchase Plan is
implemented in a series of offering periods, each six months in duration;
provided, however, that the first offering period was approximately thirteen
months in duration, ending on July 31, 2000. The price at which the common
stock may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the
Company’s common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period or on
the last day of the respective offering period.

During
2002, 781,000 shares of common stock were purchased through the
Purchase Plan at an average exercise price of $9.48 per share. As of December
31, 2002, a total of 1,587,000 shares had been issued under the Purchase Plan
at an average price of $9.54 per share, and 10,413,000 shares remained
available for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has elected to follow APB 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock-based compensation plans. Because the
exercise price of the Company’s employee stock options equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.

The fair value of each option granted or assumed through December 31, 2002
was estimated on the date of grant or date of assumption using the minimum
value (before the Company went public) or the Black-Scholes method. The fair
value of the Company’s stock-based awards was estimated using the following
weighted-average assumptions:

Year Ended December 31,

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company’s stock-based awards have characteristics significantly
different from those in traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its stock-based awards. The weighted
average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during 2002,
2001 and 2000 was $4.85, $24.42 and $56.17 per share, respectively. The
weighted average estimated fair value of shares granted under the Purchase Plan
during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $10.44, $56.30 and $3.71, respectively.

Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance

At December 31, 2002, Juniper Networks had reserved an aggregate of
143,544,000 shares of common stock for future issuance under all its Stock
Option Plans, the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and for future issuance
upon conversion of convertible subordinated notes.

Note 11. 401(k) Plan

Juniper Networks maintains a savings and retirement plan qualified under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. All employees
are eligible to participate on their first day of employment with Juniper
Networks. Under the plan, employees may contribute up to 60% of their pretax
salaries per year but not more than the statutory limits. Beginning January 1,
2001 Juniper Networks began matching employee contributions. The matching
formula is $0.50 on the dollar up to 6% of eligible pay (up to an annual
maximum of $2,000). All matching contributions vest immediately. The
Company’s matching contributions to the plan totaled $2.0 million in 2002 and
$1.4 million in 2001.

Note 12. Segment Information

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” established standards for reporting information about operating
segments in the Company’s financial statements. Operating segments are defined
as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or
decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. The Company operates as one operating segment; however, it tracks
revenue by geographic region. The following table shows net revenues by
geographic region (in thousands):

Note 13. Net Income (Loss) Per Share

The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net
income (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share
amounts):



For 2002 and 2001, Juniper Networks has excluded 11,510,000 and 16,570,000
common stock equivalents, respectively, consisting of outstanding stock options
and shares subject to repurchase from the calculation of diluted loss per share
because all such securities are antidilutive in that period due to the net
loss. Employee stock options to purchase approximately 41,271,000 shares,
25,277,000 shares and 567,000 shares in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, were
outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share because the exercise price of the stock options was greater than the
average share price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would have
been antidilutive. For 2002, 2001 and 2000, the convertible subordinate notes
were also excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because the
effect of the assumed conversion of the notes is antidilutive.

Note 15. Joint Venture

During the quarter ended June 30, 2001, Juniper Networks and Ericsson
A.B., through their respective subsidiaries, entered into a joint venture
agreement to develop and market products for the



wireless Internet infrastructure market and Juniper Networks began
recording its 40% share of the joint venture’s loss. During 2002, the
Company’s share of the joint venture’s loss totaled approximately $1.3 million,
and is recorded as a single line item in the other income section of the income
statement. To date, Juniper Networks has funded the joint venture in the
amount of $5.4 million. In addition to this joint venture, Ericsson is also a
significant reseller of Juniper Networks representing greater than 10% of our
revenues for 2002 and 2001. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has no
further obligations to fund this joint venture.

2000, respectively.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryforward
items and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and
liabilities are as follows at December 31 (in thousands):

Unused net operating loss and research and development tax credit
carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the years 2021 and
2012, respectively. The Company has provided a valuation allowance on its net
deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to
tax losses caused by employee stock option exercises. The net valuation
allowance increased by $7.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2002, $52.8
million in 2001, and by $87.9 million in 2000. At December 31, 2002,
approximately $136.0 million of the valuation allowance referenced above
relates to the tax benefits of stock option deductions that will be credited to
equity when realized. Substantially all of the remaining balance of $44.0
million relates to capital losses that will carry forward to offset future
capital gains.



The provision for income taxes differs from the provision calculated by

The IRS is currently auditing the Company’s federal income tax returns for
fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Proposed adjustments have not been received for
these years. Management believes the ultimate outcome of the IRS audits will
not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

Note 17. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the
ordinary course of business, including the matters described below. The
outcome of these matters is currently not determinable. However, the Company
does not expect that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

IPO Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs
Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson
Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG Cowen
Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase
(Hambrecht & Quist LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc.,
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated
(collectively, the “Underwriters”), the Company and certain of the Company’s
officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s
common stock in the Company’s initial public offering in June 1999 and its
secondary offering in September 1999. Specifically, among other things, this
complaint alleged that the prospectus pursuant to which shares of common stock
were sold in the Company’s initial public offering and its subsequent secondary
offering contained certain false and misleading statements or omissions
regarding the practices of the Underwriters with respect to their allocation of
shares of common stock in these offerings and their receipt of commissions from
customers related to such allocations. Various plaintiffs have filed actions
asserting similar allegations concerning the initial public offerings of
approximately 300 other companies. These various cases pending in the Southern
District of New York have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as

In re
Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation

, 21 MC 92. In April 2002,
plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the action against the
Company, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Defendants in the coordinated proceeding filed motions
to dismiss. In October 2002, the Company’s officers were dismissed from the
case without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation. On February 19, 2003, the
Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss, but declined to
dismiss the claims against the Company. The Company believes that it has
meritorious defenses to the claims against it and intends to defend itself
vigorously.



Federal Securities Class Action Suit

During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, a number of essentially identical
shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain
of its officers and former officers purportedly on behalf of those stockholders
who purchased the Company’s publicly traded securities between April 12, 2001
and June 7, 2001. In April 2002, the judge granted the defendants’ motion to
consolidate all of these actions into one; in May 2002, the court appointed the
lead plaintiffs and approved their selection of lead counsel and an amended
complaint was filed in July 2002. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants
made false and misleading statements, assert claims for violations of the
federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other
relief. In September 2002, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended
complaint. In March 2003, the judge granted
defendants motion to dismiss with leave to amend. The Company continues to believe the claims are
without merit and intends to defend the action vigorously.

State Derivative Claim Based on the Federal Securities Class Action Suit

In August 2002, a consolidated amended shareholder derivative complaint
purportedly filed on behalf of the Company, captioned

In re Juniper Networks,
Inc. Derivative Litigation

, Civil Action No. CV 807146, was filed in the
Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. The
complaint alleges that certain of the Company’s officers and directors breached
their fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct
including conduct complained of in the securities litigation described above.
The complaint also asserts claims against a Juniper Networks investor. The
Company is named solely as a nominal defendant against whom the plaintiff seeks
no recovery. In October 2002, the Company as a nominal defendant and the
individual defendants filed demurrers to the consolidated amended shareholder
derivative complaint. In March 2003, the judge sustained defendants’
demurrers with leave to amend. Plaintiffs must file an amended complaint on or before May 12, 2003.
The Company continues to believe the claims are without merit and intends to
defend the action vigorously.

ITEM 14. Controls and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on their evaluation as of a date within 90 days of the filing date
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s principal executive
officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

(b)

Changes in Internal Controls

There were no significant changes in the Company’s internal controls or
in other factors that could significantly affect these controls
subsequent to the date of their evaluation. There were no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses, and therefore there were no
corrective actions taken. However, the design of any system of controls
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events and there is no certainty that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goal under all potential future considerations,
regardless of how remote.
