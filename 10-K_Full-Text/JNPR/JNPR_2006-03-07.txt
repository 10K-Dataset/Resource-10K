PART I

ITEM 1. Business

Overview

We design and sell products and services that together provide our customers with secure and
assured Internet Protocol (“IP”) networking solutions. Our solutions are incorporated into the
global web of interconnected public and private networks across which a variety of media, including
voice, video and data, travel to and from end users around the world. Our network infrastructure
solutions enable service providers and other network-intensive businesses to support and deliver
services and applications on a highly efficient and low cost integrated network.

In 2004, we completed the acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Inc. (“NetScreen”) and in
2005, we completed the following five acquisitions: Kagoor Networks, Inc. (“Kagoor”), Redline
Networks, Inc (“Redline”), Peribit Networks, Inc. (“Peribit”), Acorn Packet Solutions, Inc.
(“Acorn”), and Funk Software, Inc. (“Funk”). As a result of the these acquisitions, we expanded
our customer base and portfolio of products, and now offer two categories of networking products:
infrastructure products, which consist predominately of the original Juniper Networks router
portfolio and Acorn products, and Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”) products, which consist
predominately of the former Funk, Peribit, Redline, Kagoor, and NetScreen products.

During 2005, our operations were organized into the following three operating segments:
Infrastructure, SLT, and Service. Our Infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable router
products that are used to control and direct network traffic. Our SLT segment offers solutions
that meet a broad array of our customer’s priorities, from protecting the network itself, and
protecting data on the network, to maximizing existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications
across a distributed network. Together, our secure networking solutions help enable our customers
to convert networks that provide commoditized, best efforts services into more valuable assets that
provide differentiation and value and increased reliability and security to end users. Our Service
segment delivers world-wide services to customers of the Infrastructure and SLT segments.
Subsequent to 2005, we re-aligned our product groups and will report Kagoor products in the
Infrastructure segment beginning in 2006.

During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, we generated net revenues of $2.06 billion and
conducted business in approximately 75 countries. See the information in Item 8 for more
information on our consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and our
consolidated results of operations, consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity, and
consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005.

We were incorporated in California in 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1997. Our
corporate headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California. Our website address is
www.juniper.net.

Our Strategy

Our objective and strategy is to provide best-in-class traffic processing technologies that
allow our customers to provide a secure and assured network experience for any application on an IP
network. Our technological leadership and problem solving abilities combined with our experience
and fundamental understanding of the requirements of high performance IP secure networking
solutions will help us in meeting our objectives. Key elements of our strategy are described
below.

Maintain and Extend Technology Leadership

.

Our application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
technology, operating system and network-optimized product architecture have been key elements to
establishing our technology leadership. We believe that these elements can be leveraged into
future products we are currently developing. We intend to maintain and extend our technological
leadership in the network infrastructure and security markets primarily through innovation and
continued investment in our research and development departments, supplemented by external
partnerships, including strategic alliances, as well as acquisitions that would allow us to deliver
a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets.

Leverage Position as Supplier of Purpose-Built Network Infrastructure and Security

.

From
inception we have focused on designing and building IP network infrastructure for service providers
and network intensive



businesses and have integrated purpose-built technology into a network optimized architecture
that specifically meets our customers’ needs. We believe that many of these customers will deploy
networking equipment from only a few vendors. We believe that the purpose-built nature of our
products provide us with a competitive advantage, which is critical in gaining rapid penetration as
one of these selected vendors.

Be Strategic to Our Customers

.

In developing our infrastructure and SLT solutions, we work
very closely with customers to design and build a product specifically to meet their complex needs.
Over time, we have expanded our understanding of the challenges facing these customers. That
increased understanding has enabled us to subsequently design additional capabilities into our
products. We believe our close relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers have
been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date. We plan to continue to work very
closely with our customers to implement enhancements to current products as well as to design
future products that specifically meet their evolving needs.

Enable New IP-Based Services

.

Our platforms enable network operators to build and secure
networks cost-effectively and to offer new differentiated services for their customers more
efficiently than legacy network products. We believe that the secure delivery of IP-based services
and applications, including web hosting, outsourced Internet and intranet services, outsourced
enterprise applications and voice-over IP, will continue to grow and are cost-effectively enabled
by our secure networking solutions.

Establish and Develop Industry Partnerships

.

Our customers have diverse requirements. While
our products meet certain requirements of our customers, our products are not intended to satisfy
certain other requirements. Therefore we believe that it is important that we build relationships
with other industry leaders in a diverse set of networking technologies and services. These
relationships ensure that we have access to those technologies and services, whether through joint
development, resale, acquisition or other collaboration, in order to better support a broader set
of our customers’ requirements.

Markets and Customers

We sell our products and services through direct sales and through distributors and
value-added resellers to end-users in the following markets:

Service Providers

Service providers include wireline, wireless, cable, and next-generation network operators.
Supporting most major service provider networks in the world, our platforms are designed and built
for the scale and dependability that service providers demand. Our secure networking solutions
benefit these customers by:

•

Reducing capital and operational costs by running multiple services over the same
network using our high density, highly reliable platforms;

•

Promoting generation of additional revenue by enabling new services to be offered to
new market segments based on our product capabilities;

•

Increasing customer satisfaction, while lowering costs, by enabling consumers to
self-select automatically provisioned service packages that provide the quality, speed
and pricing they desire; and

•

Providing increased asset longevity and higher return on investment as their networks
can scale to multi-terabit rates based on the capabilities of our platforms.

Enterprise

Our secure networking solutions are designed to meet the reliability and scalability demanded
by the world’s largest and most advanced networks. For this reason, network intensive enterprises,
federal, state and local governments, and research and education institutions that rely on their
networks for the operation of their business are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful
component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leading-edge
applications while:

•

Reducing costs through operational efficiencies in implementing and managing the network;

•

Driving down capital expenses with sophisticated network intelligence that is robust, secure, and scalable;



•

Providing enterprises with the control necessary to deliver a secure and assured user
experience to their customers and internal clients; and

•

Working as a business partner for the long term with the optimal combination of
flexibility, responsiveness, technical know-how and financial strength.

Fundamental Requirements for High Performance Secure Networks

As they work to support growth in IP traffic and seek to offer new revenue-generating or
mission-critical services, our customers require secure network solutions that are not only feature
rich but also deliver high reliability, high performance and assured user experiences.

At the same time, both service providers and enterprises must focus on detecting and
preventing the ever increasing number of security threats facing the network itself and the data
that flows across the network. This security must be innate to networking products and must not
come at the expense of overall performance or unjustifiable cost.

Feature richness, high reliability, security, high performance, scalability, and cost
effectiveness are each fundamental requirements in meeting the needs associated with the growth in
IP traffic and the secure and assured delivery of value-added services to end users.

Feature Richness.

The importance of increasing revenue streams and decreasing capital and
operational costs for our customers is a significant priority in the industry. Service providers
want to sell more revenue generating services with better cost efficiencies. Enterprises and other
network operators want to provide a secure and assured network experience to their end users on a
cost effective but value-generating basis. Each of these goals is ultimately a function of the
features and capabilities that can be securely provided on each of the network elements. As
networks advance, more and more features are required to sell new services as well as to lower the
ongoing costs of operating the network. Next generation networking solutions therefore need to have
flexibility to add new capabilities frequently without compromising the performance of the system,
which gets increasingly difficult as the network demands increase.

High Reliability

.

As businesses and consumers increasingly rely on IP networks for
mission-critical applications, high network reliability is essential. As a result, those businesses
and consumers expect service providers to deliver a high degree of reliability in their networks.

Security

.

Today’s network environment presents an ever-increasing number of challenges
regarding network security ranging from simple denial of service attacks to sophisticated,
pervasive and malicious intrusions. The importance of security is increasing within all of our
customers and we are continually improving and evolving the security capabilities on all of our
product solutions. It is extremely important to provide comprehensive network-based security
services that are fully integrated, free of performance trade-offs, and scaleable to any customer
or market.

High Performance Without Compromising Intelligence

.

To handle the rapid growth in IP traffic,
today’s network operators increasingly require secure networking solutions that can operate at
higher speeds, while still delivering real-time services such as security and quality-of-service
features. The processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated forwarding
technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination based on priority, data type and
other considerations. Since a large number of IP packets, many of which perform critical
administrative functions, are small in size, high performance IP routers need to achieve their
specified transmission speeds even for small packet sizes. Since smaller packets increase packet
processing demands, routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be more resource intensive
than routing of larger packets. A wire speed router, which achieves its specified transmission rate
for any type of traffic passing through it, can accomplish this task. Thus, provisioning of
mission-critical services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed
processing.

High Performance Under Stressful Conditions

.

In a large and complex network, individual
components inevitably fail. However, the failure of an individual device or link must not
compromise the network as a whole. In a typical network, when a failure occurs, the network loses
some degree of capacity and, in turn, a greater load falls on the remaining network routers, which
must provide alternate routes. IP infrastructure must quickly adjust to the new state of the
network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping significant numbers of packets when
active routes are lost or when large numbers of routes change. Routing protocols are used to
accomplish this convergence, a process that places even greater stress on the router. Given the
complexity of IP network



infrastructure, the convergence process is complex and places a far greater load on the
router, thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device.

Scalability

.

Due to the rapid growth in IP traffic, service providers must continuously expand
their networks, both in terms of increased numbers of access points of presence (PoPs), and also
greater capacity per PoP. To facilitate this expansion process, secure networking solutions must
be highly scalable. Next generation network appliances therefore need to be flexible and
configurable to function within constantly changing networks while incurring minimal downtime.

High Return on Investment

.

Continued growth in IP traffic, price competition in the
telecommunications market and increasing pressure for network operators to attain higher returns on
their network infrastructure investments all contribute to our customers’ desire for solutions that
significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build and operate their networks. In
addition to the basic cost of equipment, network operators incur substantial ancillary costs for
the space required to deploy the equipment, power consumed and ongoing operation and maintenance of
the equipment. Network operators therefore want to deploy dense and varied equipment configurations
in limited amounts of rack and floor space. Therefore, in order to continue to scale their networks
toward higher data speeds in a cost effective manner, network operators need the ability to mix and
match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities, without significantly
increasing the consumption of space or power and driving costs higher.

These requirements define a clear need for IP infrastructure and security solutions that can
support high speeds and offer new IP-based services. At the same time, network operators are
eagerly seeking new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within their
networks and reduce the cost of their architectures.

Our Technology and Products

Early in our history, we developed, marketed and sold the first commercially available
purpose-built IP backbone router optimized for the specific high performance needs of service
providers. As the need for core bandwidth continued to increase, the need for service rich
platforms at the edge of the network was created. Our infrastructure products are designed to
address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless access by
combining high-performance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a
network-optimized solution.

With the acquisition of NetScreen, we added a broad family of network security solutions that
deliver high performance, cost-effective security for enterprises, service providers and government
entities, including firewall and virtual private network (“VPN”) systems and appliances, secure
sockets layer (“SSL”) VPN appliances, and intrusion detection and prevention (“IDP”) appliances.
With the acquisitions of Funk, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor, we added complementary products and
technologies to our SLT product family that enable our customers to provide additional IP-based
services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and applications.

Our infrastructure products offer a full suite of scalable, tested routing protocols, which
are used to control and direct network traffic, and are critical to a network routing solution.
This control is made more important by the fact that the size and complexity of IP networks are
increasing at a time when service providers are looking to differentiate themselves through
value-added service offerings. Our firewall and VPN systems are standards-based for easy
integration into customer networks, and deliver integrated firewall, VPN and denial of service
protection capabilities in a single device. Our IDP appliances incorporate multiple methods of
detection, such as attack pattern matching, protocol anomaly detection and backdoor detection, and
stop attacks based on known patterns of attack, suspicious traffic or connection requests.

Infrastructure Products

We believe that an overview of the physical nature of our infrastructure products is helpful
in understanding the operation of our business.

Although specific designs vary among our product families, our platforms are essentially
modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. The chassis contains components
that enable and support many of the fundamental functions of the router, such as power supplies,
cooling fans, and components that run our JUNOS or JUNOSe operating system, perform high-speed
packet forwarding, or keep track of the structure of the network and instruct the packet forwarding
components where to send packets. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to
be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces.



The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from
the network over a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission
medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely
depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. In some cases, modules do not
contain ports or physically receive packets from the network, but rather enhance the overall
functionality of the router. We refer to these components as service modules.

Major infrastructure product families are summarized as follows:

•

M-Series and T-Series:

Our M-series platforms are extremely versatile as they can
be deployed at the edge of operator networks, in small and medium core networks, and
in other applications. The M-series product family includes the M320, M160, M40e,
M20, M10i and M7i platforms. Our T-series platforms, T640, T320, and TX Matrix, are
primarily designed for core IP infrastructures. The M-series and T-series products
leverage our ASIC technology and the same JUNOS operating system to enable
continuous and predictable service delivery.

•

E-Series:

Our E-series products are a full featured platform with support for
carrier-class routing, broadband subscriber management services and a comprehensive
set of IP services. The E-series family includes the ERX-1440, -1410, -710, -705
and -310 platforms and the E320 platform. Leveraging our JUNOSe operating system,
the E-Series service delivery architecture enables service providers to easily
deploy innovative revenue generating services to their customers and avoid the
costly and limiting piecemeal outcomes that result from equipment that delivers
inconsistent edge services. All E-Series platforms offer a full suite of routing
protocols and provide scalable capacity for tens of thousands of users.

Service Layer Technologies Products

SLT products provide network security solutions and enable our customers to provide additional
IP-based services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and
applications.

Major SLT product families are summarized as follows:

•

Firewall and VPN Systems:

Our NS-5400, -5200, and -500 products and ISG-2000 and
- -1000 products are high performance security systems designed to provide integrated
firewall, VPN and denial of service protection capabilities for enterprise
environments and carrier network infrastructures. Our ISG-2000 and -1000 products
can also deliver intrusion detection and prevention functionality with the addition
of optional security modules to the base ISG chassis. Each of our firewall and VPN
systems can be deployed in high bandwidth environments and can be used to deliver
managed security services. Our firewall and VPN systems allow unique security
policies to be enforced for multiple virtual local area networks, or VLANs, allowing
a single system to secure multiple networks. Our security systems also allow for
the creation of multiple Virtual Systems, each providing a unique security domain
with its own virtual firewall and VPN and dedicated management interface. These
features enable enterprises, carriers and government entities to use a single
security system to secure multiple networks and enable carriers to deliver security
services to multiple customers.

•

Firewall and VPN Appliances

: Our NS-208, -204, -100, -50, -25, -5XT and -5XP
security appliances are fixed configuration products of varying performance
characteristics that offer integrated firewall, VPN and denial of service protection
capabilities. Our Secure Services Gateway 500 Series (SSG) represents a new class
of purpose-built security appliance that delivers a mix of high performance,
security and LAN/WAN connectivity for regional and branch office deployments. Our
security appliances are designed to maximize security and performance while using
less physical space than competing products. Our security appliances can be
deployed to provide small to medium-sized businesses and enterprise remote locations
with secure Internet access and communication.

•

Secure Access Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) VPN Appliances

: Our Secure
Access-6000, -4000 and -2000, and

- 700

appliances are used to secure remote access
for mobile employees, secure extranets for customers and partners, and secure
intranets. Our SSL VPN appliances are designed to be used in enterprise
environments of all sizes.



•

Intrusion Detection and Prevention (“IDP”) Appliances

: Our IDP-1100, -600, -200
and -50 appliances utilize intrusion detection methods to increase the attack
detection accuracy and provide the broadest attack detection coverage available.
Our IDP appliances provide fast and efficient traffic processing and alarm
collection, presentation and forwarding. Once an attack is detected, our IDP
appliances prevent the intrusion by dropping the packets or connection associated
with the attack, reducing or eliminating the effects of the attack. Our IDP
appliances can also alert the IT staff to respond to the attack. Our IDP appliances
can be clustered to provide high availability and reduce risk associated with a
single point of failure.

•

Application Acceleration Platforms

: Our WX, WXC, and DX products improve the
performance of client-server and web-enabled business applications for
branch-office, remote, and mobile users. These application acceleration platforms
enable our customers to deliver LAN-like performance to users around the globe who
access centralized applications.

•

Access Control Appliances

: Our IC-4000 and -6000 appliances combine
identity-based policy and end-point intelligence to give enterprises real-time
visibility and policy control throughout the network.

See Note 12 in Item 8 for a breakdown of net product revenues by categories of products.

Sales and Marketing

As of December 31, 2005, we employed 1,419 employees in our worldwide sales and marketing
organizations. These sales employees operate within their respective regions and generally either
engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller
relationships. Information concerning our revenues by significant customers and by geographic
region can be found in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Direct Sales Structure

Our direct sales organization is organized into three geographic theaters and within each
theater according to the particular needs in that market. Our three geographic theaters are (i)
the Americas, (ii) Europe, Middle East and Africa, and (iii) Asia Pacific. Our direct
relationships with our customers are governed either by customer purchase orders and our
acknowledgement of those orders or by purchase contracts. In instances where we have contracts
with our customer, those contracts set forth only general terms of sale and do not require
customers to purchase specified quantities of our products.

Global Channel System

In our sales and marketing efforts, we also employ a global network of strategic distribution
relationships, as well as theater or country-specific distributors and value added resellers.
Value-added resellers include our strategic resellers, which resell our products to end-users
around the world. Within each theater, in addition to our direct sales force, we employ sales
professionals to assist with the management of our various sales channels.

We have strategic reseller relationships with Ericsson, Lucent Technologies, and Siemens. We
believe that each of these companies have significant customer relationships in place and offer
products that complement our product offerings. Our arrangements with each of these partners allow
them to resell our products on a worldwide, non-exclusive basis, provide for discounts based upon
the volume of products sold and specify other general terms of sale. The agreements do not require
these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products. Siemens accounted for greater
than 10% of our total net revenues in 2005.

In addition to these strategic reseller relationships, we maintain relationships with
distributors and value-added resellers in various theaters. These distributors and value-added
resellers tend to be focused on particular theaters or particular countries within theaters. For
example, we have substantial distribution relationships with Ingram Micro in the Americas and with
NEC in Japan. The value-added resellers have expertise in deploying complex networking solutions
in their respective markets. Our agreements with these distributors and value-added resellers are
generally non-exclusive, limited by theater, and provide product discounts and other ordinary terms
of sale. These agreements do not require our distributors or value-added resellers to purchase
specified quantities of our products.



Customer Service and Support

As of December 31, 2005, we employed 476 people in our worldwide customer service and support
organization. We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful
customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with
proven network experience to provide those services. In most cases, our customer service and
support organization provides front line product support and is the problem resolution interface to
our partners and direct end users. We offer the following services: 24x7x365 technical assistance,
hardware repair and replacement, unspecified updates, professional services and educational
services. We deliver these services directly to major end users and also utilize a multi-tiered
support model, leveraging the capabilities of our partners and third party organizations. We also
train our channel partners in the delivery of education and support services.

Research and Development

As of December 31, 2005, we employed 1,736 people in our worldwide research and development
organization. We have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the
fields of high-end computing, network system design, security, routing protocols and embedded
operating systems. These individuals have worked in leading computer data networking and
telecommunications companies. In addition to building complex hardware and operating systems, the
engineering team has experience in delivering highly integrated ASICs and scalable technology.

We believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of
enhancing our core technology, developing additional applications, incorporating that technology
and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings. In our infrastructure
and SLT products, we are leveraging our ASIC technology, developing additional network interfaces
targeted to our customer applications and continuing to develop next generation technology to
support the anticipated growth in IP network requirements. We continue to expand the functionality
of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability, and to provide an enhanced user
interface.

Our research and development process is driven by the availability of new technology, market
demand and customer feedback. We have invested significant time and resources in creating a
structured process for all product development projects. This process involves all functional
groups and all levels. Following an assessment of market demand, our research and development team
develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the
product management and sales organizations. This process is designed to provide a framework for
defining and addressing the steps, tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and
development projects to market.

Manufacturing and Operations

As of December 31, 2005, we employed 134 employees in manufacturing and operations who
primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and
monitor and manage product testing and quality. We currently have manufacturing relationships
primarily with Celestica and Plexus, under which we have subcontracted the majority of our
manufacturing activity. This subcontracting activity extends from prototypes to full production
and includes activities such as material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to
our customers and repairs. Together with our contract manufacturers, we design, specify, and
monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards. These
arrangements provide us with the following benefits:

•

We conserve the working capital that would be required for funding inventory;

•

We can quickly deliver products to customers with turnkey manufacturing and drop-shipment capabilities;

•

We gain economies of scale because, by purchasing large quantities of common
components, our contract manufacturers obtain more favorable pricing than we could
buying components alone; and

•

We operate without dedicating significant space to manufacturing operations.

Our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on rolling forecasts from us about
our product demands. Each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble
the products in our forecast and test the products according to our specifications. Products are
then shipped directly to our distributors, value-added resellers or end-users. We generally do not
own the components and title to the products transfers from



the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. In certain
circumstances, we may be liable to our contract manufacturers for carrying and obsolete material
charges for excess components purchased based on our forecasts.

Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers, those contracts merely set forth a
framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us. The contracts
do not require them to manufacture our products on a long-term basis.

Our ASICs are manufactured primarily by sole sources, such as IBM and Toshiba, each of whom is
responsible for all aspects of the production of the ASICs using our proprietary designs.

Backlog

We believe that backlog information is not relevant to an understanding of our overall
business as our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of
products and industry practice allows customers to cancel or change orders with limited advance
notice prior to shipment.

Competition

Competition in the network infrastructure and security markets is intense. Cisco Systems,
has historically dominated the market, with other companies such as Nortel Networks, Alcatel,
CheckPoint Software Technologies, and Huawei Technologies providing competitive products. In
addition, a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address
the same needs that our products address. We believe that our ability to compete with Cisco and
others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs
of our current and potential customers.

We expect that, over time, large companies with significant resources, technical expertise,
market experience, customer relationships and broad product lines, such as Cisco, Nortel, Alcatel,
and Huawei Technologies, will introduce new products which are designed to compete more effectively
in this market. As a result, we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger
companies with significantly more resources than we have. Although we believe that our technology
and the purpose-built features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete
effectively with these companies, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful.

Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco, Nortel, Alcatel, and Huawei
Technologies have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their products with
other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products.
Also, many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more
extensive customer bases that could be leveraged. Increased competition could result in price
reduction, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which
could seriously harm our operating results.

There are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities
than our products. Consolidation in this industry has begun, with one or more of these smaller
private companies being acquired by large, established suppliers of network infrastructure
products, and we believe it is likely to continue. As a result, we expect to face increased
competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have.

Several companies also provide solutions that can substitute for some uses of routers. For
example, high bandwidth Asynchronous Transfer Mode (“ATM”) switches are used in the core of certain
major backbone service providers. ATM switches can carry a variety of traffic types, including
voice, video and data, using fixed, 53 byte cells. Companies that use ATM switches are enhancing
their products with new software technologies such as Multi-Protocol Label Switching (“MPLS”),
which can potentially simplify the task of mixing routers and switches in the same network. These
substitutes can reduce the need for large numbers of routers.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed
technology and know-how. Our engineering teams have significant expertise in ASIC design and we
own all rights to the design of the ASICs, which form the core of many of our products. Our
operating systems were developed internally and are protected by United States and other copyright
laws.



While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology,
we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new
product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential
to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no assurance that
others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology.

In addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From
time to time, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new
products or product enhancements. There can be no assurance that third-party licenses will be
available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability to
maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain
third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements, could require us
to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any
of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and
protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the
patent applications that we have filed, or that we will be able to obtain the necessary
intellectual property rights or those other parties will not contest our intellectual property
rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we had 4,145 full-time employees, 379 of whom were in general and
administrative functions. We have not
experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Competition for personnel in our industry is intense. We believe that our future success depends in
part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain qualified personnel. We believe that we
have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will
continue to be successful in the future. In addition, recently adopted accounting rules will
require us to begin treating certain equity incentives traditionally given to employees as a
compensation expense. By causing us to record significantly increased compensation costs, such
accounting changes will reduce our reported earnings and will require us to reduce the availability
and amount of equity incentives provided to employees, which may make it more difficult for us to
attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and we anticipate that we will experience higher
voluntary employee turnover than we have historically.

Our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key
technical, sales and senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement
requiring service for any defined period of time. The loss of the services of one or more of our
key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, train and
retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel
is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

Factors That May Affect Future Results

Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies involve significant risks. The
market price of our stock reflects a higher multiple of expected future earnings than many other
companies. Accordingly, even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and
earnings, whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results, changes in the
mix of the products and services sold, acquisitions, industry changes or other factors, could
trigger significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. Investors in our
securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors, including but not limited to the
following factors, that could affect our stock price.

Fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period
and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results.

Our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products
in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties and
constrained spending on network expansion have previously resulted (for example, in 2001 and 2002),
and may in the future result, in decreased revenues and earnings and could also negatively impact
our ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer relationships. Economic downturns may
also lead to restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments. In
addition, our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high
percentage of our expenses are, and will continue to be, fixed in the short-term. Uncertainty about
future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions
about future investments. Future economic weakness, customer financial difficulties and reductions
in spending on network expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products
and consequently on our results of operations and stock price.

Our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations
and, as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which
could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a
number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock
price to fluctuate.

The factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include, but are not
limited to, limited visibility into customer spending plans, changes in the mix of products sold,
changing market conditions, including current and potential customer consolidation, competition,
customer concentration, long sales and implementation cycles, regional economic and political
conditions and seasonality. For example, many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal
fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the first and third quarters.

As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating results are not
necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be. It is likely that in some
future quarters, our operating results may be below one or more of the expectations of securities
analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline. Such a decline
could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenue and/or
earnings guidance.

We sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and IP
infrastructure and, if the demand for network and IP systems does not continue to grow, then our
business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.

A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth of IP infrastructure
and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of IP
services. As a result of changes in the economy and capital spending or the building of network
capacity in excess of demand, all of which have in the past particularly affected
telecommunications service providers, spending on IP infrastructure can vary, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

A limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any
decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and
operating results.

A substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers
and distribution partners. Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and Ericsson accounted for greater than 10% of our net
revenues during the year ended December 31, 2003. This customer concentration increases the risk of
quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results. Any downturn in the business of our
key customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease



sales to such customers, which could adversely affect our net revenues and results of
operations. In addition, there has been and continues to be consolidation in the telecommunications
industry (for example, the acquisitions of AT&T and MCI). This consolidation may cause our
customers who are involved in these acquisitions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases
of our products or have other unforeseen consequences.

We face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial
results.

Competition is intense in the markets that we address. The IP infrastructure market has
historically been dominated by Cisco Systems, Inc., with other companies such as Alcatel S.A.,
Nortel Networks Corporation, and Huawei Technologies providing products to a smaller segment of the
market. In addition, a number of other small public or private companies have products or have
announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address.

In the service layer technologies market, we face intense competition from a broader group of
companies including appliance vendors such as Cisco Systems, Inc and software vendors such as
CheckPoint Software Technologies. In addition, a number of other small public or private companies
have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our
products address.

If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis
of product offerings or price, we could experience a loss in market share and revenues and/or be
required to reduce prices, which could reduce our gross margins, and which could materially and
adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

The long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well as our expectation that
some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause our revenues
and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

A customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of
its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. As a result, the sales
cycle may be lengthy. In particular, customers making critical decisions regarding the design and
implementation of large or next-generation networks may engage in very lengthy procurement
processes that may delay or impact expected future orders. Throughout the sales cycle, we may
spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the
use and benefits of our products. Even after making the decision to purchase, customers may deploy
our products slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill
set of the customer, the size of the network deployment, the complexity of the customer’s network
environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the
products. Customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a
periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an
irregular basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will tend to
sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause revenues and operating results to
vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter.

We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, which
makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face
increased challenges in supply chain management in the future.

With the current demand for electronic products, component shortages are possible and the
predictability of the availability of such components may be limited. Growth in our business and
the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project
overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels. If shortages or delays persist,
the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all. We may
not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new
products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can
be developed. We currently purchase numerous key components, including application-specific
integrated circuits (ASICs), from single or limited sources. The development of alternate sources
for those components is time consuming, difficult and costly. In addition, the lead times
associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and
delivery schedules. In the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these
suppliers, we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner. If, as a
result, we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on
a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver product to our customers, which would seriously
impact present and future sales, which would, in turn, adversely affect our business.



In addition, the development, licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may
increase the complexity of supply chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of key
components and products would adversely affect our business.

If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional
costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business.

We provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers. If we overestimate our
requirements, the contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess
inventory, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. Conversely, because lead times
for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific
supplier, contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time, if we underestimate our
requirements, the contract manufacturers may have inadequate time or materials and components
required to produce our products, which could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and
result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues.

We are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long-term supply
contracts, and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or
disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships.

We depend primarily on independent contract manufacturers (each of whom is a third party
manufacturer for numerous companies) to manufacture our products. Although we have contracts with
our contract manufacturers, those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a
long-term basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price. In addition, it is time
consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships.
Therefore, if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if
one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our
manufacturing operations, or we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract
manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the
addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our
supply chain management. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial
results.

Integration of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm
our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders.

We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in order to enhance our business. In 2005
we completed the acquisitions of Funk, Acorn, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor. Acquisitions involve
numerous risks, including problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products,
unanticipated costs, diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses, adverse effects
on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks associated with entering
markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products,
technologies or personnel that we might acquire. The integration of businesses that we have
acquired has been, and will continue to be, a complex, time consuming and expensive process. For
example, although we completed the acquisition of NetScreen in April 2004, integration of the
products, operations, and personnel is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable
future. Acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership of our
current stockholders, assume liabilities, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets
that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment
charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and
immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our
operating results and financial condition.

In addition, if we fail in our integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a
combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures,
financial controls and human resources practices, our business and financial condition may be
adversely affected.

We rely on value-added resellers and distribution partners to sell our products, and
disruptions to, or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the
processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues
from the sale of our products.

Our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful
relationships with a variety of value-added reseller and distribution partners. The majority of our
revenues are derived through value-added resellers and distributors, most of which also sell
competitors’ products. Our revenues depend in part on the performance of



these partners. The loss of or reduction in sales to our value-added resellers or distributors
could materially reduce our revenues. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in
incentivizing current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent
or reduce sales of our products. If we fail to maintain relationships with our partners, fail to
develop new relationships with value-added resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the
number of distributors and resellers in existing markets, fail to manage, train or motivate
existing value-added resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful
in their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer.

In addition, we recognize a portion of our revenue based on a sell-through model using
information provided by our distributors. If those distributors provide us with inaccurate or
untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted.

Further, in order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must continue to scale
and improve our processes and procedures that support it, and those processes and procedures may
become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage. Our failure to successfully manage
and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could
adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products.

We expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not
be sustainable.

Our product gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter and the recent level of gross
margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors,
including product mix shifts, increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we
compete, increases in material or labor costs, excess product component or obsolescence charges
from our contract manufacturers, increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges
incurred due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product
demand, warranty related issues, or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with
different pricing and cost structures.

Recent rulemaking by the Financial Accounting Standards Board will require us to expense
equity compensation given to our employees and will significantly harm our operating results and
may reduce our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees.

We historically have used stock options as a significant component of our employee
compensation program in order to align employees’ interests with the interests of our stockholders,
encourage employee retention, and provide competitive compensation packages. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board has adopted changes that will require companies to record a charge to
earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives. We adopted this standard
effective January 1, 2006. By causing us to record significantly increased compensation costs, such
accounting changes will reduce our reported earnings and will require us to reduce the availability
and amount of equity incentives provided to employees, which may make it more difficult for us to
attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Each of these results could materially and adversely
affect our business.

Our reported financial results could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or other
intangible assets with indefinite lives.

We are required to annually test, and review on an interim basis, our goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives, including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any
future acquisitions, to determine if impairment has occurred. If such assets are deemed impaired,
an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the
assets would be recognized. This would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would
reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to
have occurred. For example, such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock
falls below certain levels or if the portions of our business related to companies we have acquired
fail to grow at expected rates or decline. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of
any impairment of assets.



Our ability to process orders and ship product is dependent in part on our business systems
and upon interfaces with the systems of third parties such as our suppliers or other partners. If
our systems, the systems of those third parties or the interfaces between them fail, our business
processes could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed.

Some of our business processes depend upon our information technology systems and on
interfaces with the systems of third parties. For example, our order entry system feeds information
into the systems of our contract manufacturers, which enables them to build and ship our products.
If those systems fail, our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all. This could
negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business, and our financial
results could be harmed.

Our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors, our business could be
adversely affected and we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any
alleged or actual failure of our products and services.

Our products are highly technical and complex, are critical to the operation of many networks
and, in the case of our security products, provide and monitor network security and may protect
valuable information. Our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors,
defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after a
product has been installed and used by end customers. Any errors or security vulnerabilities
discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in
revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could
adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we could face claims for
product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is
costly and may divert management’s attention. In addition, if our business liability insurance
coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our
financial condition could be harmed.

A breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products, which
could cause us to lose revenues.

If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of
our security products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market
perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. This could cause us to lose
current and potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential value-added resellers
and distributors. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks
change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be
unable to anticipate these techniques.

If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product
enhancements that meet those needs, or if those products do not gain market acceptance, we may not
be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to
develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner.
If we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements
to meet those needs, such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our
present and future products, which would significantly harm our business and financial results.
Even if we are able to anticipate, develop and commercially introduce new products and
enhancements, there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread
market acceptance. Any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect
our business and financial results.

If our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations will be
delayed or cancelled and could harm our business.

Our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks, each of which
have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other
vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been
added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products will be required to
interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in
order to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in
the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix
or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing
software and hardware, which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results. In
addition, if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks, demand for our
products could be adversely affected, orders for our products could be cancelled or our products
could be returned. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation and seriously harm
our business and prospects.



Litigation or claims regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming, expensive
and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute, defend or make our products
non-infringing.

Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related
to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies
and related standards that are relevant to our products. For example, in 2003, Toshiba Corporation
filed a lawsuit against us, alleging that our products infringe certain Toshiba patents. The
asserted claims and/or initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers,
suppliers or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our
products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly
litigation and may require us to develop non-infringing technologies or enter into license
agreements. Furthermore, because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief
that are not necessarily predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for
significant amounts of money. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against
us by any third party is successful, if we are required to settle litigation for significant
amounts of money, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license required
proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results
and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

We are a party to lawsuits, which, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay
damages which could harm our business and financial condition.

We and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board
of directors are subject to various lawsuits. There can be no assurance that actions that have been
brought against us or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor. Regardless of
whether they are in our favor, these lawsuits are, and any future lawsuits to which we may become a
party will likely be, expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve. Such costs of defense and
any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.

Due to the global nature of our operations, economic or social conditions or changes in a
particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses,
which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.

We conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through
our distributors and value-added resellers in countries throughout the world and also depend on the
operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located inside and outside of the
United States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety
of uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others, political or social unrest, natural
disasters, epidemic disease, war, or economic instability in a specific country or region, trade
protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or
export our products from various countries, service provider and government spending patterns
affected by political considerations and difficulties in staffing and managing international
operations. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, costs,
expenses, results of operations and financial condition.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our
financial results and cash flows.

Because a majority of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to
adverse movements in non-US currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as
business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and
cash flows.

The majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in US Dollars. We also have some
transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen, Hong Kong
Dollar, British Pound and the Euro, related to our sales and service operations outside of the
United States. An increase in the value of the US Dollar could increase the real cost to our
customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in US Dollars,
and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw
materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies.

Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and
liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign
currency cash flows. The hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of
currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. If our attempts to
hedge against these risks are not successful, our net income could be adversely impacted.



Traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies generally require more
onerous terms and conditions of their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to such customers,
we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our
business.

Traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies, because of their size,
generally have had greater purchasing power and, accordingly, have requested and received more
favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors. As
we seek to sell more products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree to such terms
and conditions, which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue
and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

For example, many customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who
promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality and/or had products that
caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers. As a result, this class of
customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to
deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be
caused by our products. These additional requests and penalties, if we are required to agree to
them, would affect our ability to recognize the revenues from such sales, which may negatively
affect our business and our financial condition.

Our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party technology and if licenses of
third-party technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive, our revenues
and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected.

We integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From time to time,
we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or
product enhancements. Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us
on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses
required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new
products and product enhancements, could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower
quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to develop, market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or
hire key personnel.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of key
executive, engineering, sales, marketing and support personnel. The supply of highly qualified
individuals, in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas, or sales people
specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets, is limited and competition for such
individuals is intense. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement
for any specific term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to
attract or retain key personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly
engineers and sales people, and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new
employees, could delay the development and introduction of new products, and negatively impact our
ability to market, sell or support our products.

Our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and
restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions. Past
restructuring efforts may prove to be inadequate or may impair our ability to realize our current
or future business objectives.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market
requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively
scale our business and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and
conditions. In periods of market expansion, we have increased investment in our business by, for
example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in research and development and other
parts of our business. Conversely, during 2001 and 2002, in response to downward trending industry
and market conditions, we restructured our business and reduced our workforce. In addition, we
expect that we will have to change our facilities in certain locations and we may face difficulties
and significant expenses identifying and moving into suitable office space and subleasing or
assigning any surplus space. These changes and other similar actions taken to respond to
fluctuating market and economic conditions have placed, and our anticipated future operations will
continue to place, significant demands on our management resources. This may increase the potential
likelihood of other risks, and our business may suffer if we fail to effectively manage changes in
the size and scope of our operations.



We may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in
restructuring our business in the past and, even if successfully implemented, these initiatives may
not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions. Furthermore, our past
workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives.
Lastly, costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the
estimated costs of such actions and/or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings, all of which
could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

If we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and
processes, our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly
evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process. We will need to continue
to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order
to manage our business effectively in the future. If we fail to continue to implement improved
systems and processes, our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be
negatively affected.

We are subject to risks arising from our international operations.

We derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations, and we plan to
continue expanding our business in international markets in the future. As a result of our
international operations, we are affected by economic, regulatory and political conditions in
foreign countries, including changes in IT spending generally, the imposition of government
controls, changes or limitations in trade protection laws, unfavorable changes in tax treaties or
laws, natural disasters, labor unrest, earnings expatriation restrictions, misappropriation of
intellectual property, acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors,
which could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations. In particular, in
some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection. Moreover, local laws and
customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the United States. In many foreign
countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common for others to engage in
business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United States
regulations applicable to us. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees,
contractors and agents will not take actions in violations of them. Violations of laws or key
control policies by our employees, contractors or agents could result in financial reporting
problems, fines, penalties, prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could
have a material adverse effect on our business.

While we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we
are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal
controls.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on, and our
independent auditors to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing
necessary to comply with these requirements. We have and will continue to incur significant
expenses and devote management resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. In the
event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered public
accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not
effective as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could
cause a decline in the market price of our stock.

Governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect
our revenues.

The United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license
requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
technology. In addition, from time to time, governmental agencies have proposed additional
regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of
private encryption keys. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports
or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm
our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues.

Regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future
prospects.

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition
could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications
industry. Currently, there are few laws or



regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on IP networks. We could be adversely
affected by regulation of IP networks and commerce in any country where we operate. Such
regulations could address matters such as voice over the Internet or using Internet Protocol,
encryption technology, and access charges for service providers. In addition, regulations have been
adopted with respect to environmental matters, such as the Waste
Electrical and Electronic Equipment
(WEEE) and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in
Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) regulations adopted by the European Union, as well as regulations prohibiting government entities from
purchasing security products that do not meet specified local certification criteria. Compliance with such regulations may be costly and time-consuming for us and our suppliers and partners. The adoption
and implementation of such regulations could decrease demand for our products, and at the same time could increase the cost
of building and selling our products as well as impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or
other tax returns could adversely affect our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than
anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in
countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are
subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and
other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance
that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our
operating results and financial condition.

ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

ITEM 2. Properties

We lease approximately 1.4 million square feet world wide, with nearly 80 percent being in
North America. Our corporate headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California and consists of five
buildings totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet. Each building is subject to an
individual lease or sublease, which provides various option, expansion and extension provisions.
The corporate headquarters leases expire between June 2012 and May 2014. Additionally, we lease an
approximately 0.3 million square foot facility in Westford, Massachusetts. The leases expire
between January and March 2011. We also lease facilities in other locations and own approximately
80 acres of land adjacent to our leased corporate headquarters location.

In addition to our offices in Sunnyvale and Westford, we also lease offices in various
locations throughout the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia
Pacific region, including in China, India, Ireland, Israel, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands,
Russia, and the United Kingdom. Our current offices are in good condition and appropriately
support our business needs.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

We are subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, such
as employment or intellectual property claims, including the matters described below. The outcome
of any such matters is currently not determinable. Although we do not expect that such legal
claims and litigation will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations, an adverse result in one or more matters could negatively affect
our results in the period in which they occur.

IPO Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG
Cowen Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase (Hambrecht & Quist
LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc., Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated (collectively, the “Underwriters”), our Company and certain of
our officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of our common stock in our initial
public offering in June 1999 and our secondary offering in September 1999.

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that the prospectus pursuant to which
shares of common stock were sold in our initial public offering and our subsequent secondary
offering contained certain false and



misleading statements or omissions regarding the practices of the Underwriters with respect to
their allocation of shares of common stock in these offerings and their receipt of commissions from
customers related to such allocations. Various plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar
allegations concerning the initial public offerings of approximately 300 other issuers. These
various cases pending in the Southern District of New York have been coordinated for pretrial
proceedings as In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, 21 MC 92. In April 2002,
plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the action against us, alleging violations of
the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Defendants in the coordinated
proceeding filed motions to dismiss. In October 2002, our officers were dismissed from the case
without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation. On February 19, 2003, the court granted in part and
denied in part the motion to dismiss, but declined to dismiss the claims against us.

In June 2004, a stipulation for the settlement and release of claims against the issuers,
including us, was submitted to the Court for approval. The terms of the settlement, if approved,
would dismiss and release all claims against participating defendants (including us). In exchange
for this dismissal, Directors and Officers insurance carriers would agree to guarantee a recovery
by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants of at least $1.0 billion, and the issuer
defendants would agree to an assignment or surrender to the plaintiffs of certain claims the issuer
defendants may have against the underwriters. On August 31, 2005, the Court granted preliminary
approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to a number of conditions, including final
court approval. If the settlement does not occur, and litigation continues, we believe we have
meritorious defenses and intend to defend the case vigorously.

Federal Securities Class Action Suit

During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, a number of essentially identical shareholder class
action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against us and certain of our officers and former officers purportedly on behalf of
those stockholders who purchased our publicly traded securities between April 12, 2001 and June 7,
2001. In April 2002, the court granted the defendants’ motion to consolidate all of these actions
into one; in May 2002, the court appointed the lead plaintiffs and approved their selection of lead
counsel and a consolidated complaint was filed in August 2002. The plaintiffs allege that the
defendants made false and misleading statements, assert claims for violations of the federal
securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. In September 2002, the
defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. In March 2003, the court granted defendants
motion to dismiss with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed their amended complaint in April 2003
and the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in May 2003. In March 2004, the court
granted defendants motion to dismiss, without leave to amend, and entered final judgment against
plaintiffs. Plaintiffs appealed. In December 2005, after complete briefing and oral argument, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal and
final judgment.

State Derivative Claim Based on the Federal Securities Class Action Suit

In August 2002, a consolidated amended shareholder derivative complaint purportedly filed on
behalf of us, captioned In re Juniper Networks, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Civil Action No. CV
807146, was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. The
complaint alleges that certain of our officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to us
by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct including conduct complained of in the securities
litigation described above. We are named solely as a nominal defendant against whom the plaintiffs
seek no recovery. After having their previous complaints dismissed with leave to amend, Plaintiffs
lodged a third amended complaint in August 2004. Defendants demurred to the third amended
complaint. On November 18, 2004, the Court sustained defendants’ demurrer without leave to amend
and entered an order of final judgment against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs appealed to the California
Court of Appeal, Sixth District. The appeal has been fully briefed by the parties. Oral argument
has not yet been scheduled.

Toshiba Patent Infringement Litigation

On November 13, 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed suit in the United States District Court in
Delaware against us, alleging that certain of our products infringe four Toshiba patents and
seeking an injunction and unspecified damages. We filed an answer to the complaint in February
2004. Toshiba amended its complaint to add two patents, and we answered the amended complaint in
July 2004. The case is in the discovery phase, and trial is scheduled for August 2006.



IRS Notices of Proposed Adjustments

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has concluded an audit of our federal income tax returns
for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. During 2004, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA)
from the IRS. While the final resolution of the issues raised in the NOPA is uncertain, we do not
believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations. We are also under routine examination by certain
state and non-US tax authorities. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably
foreseeable outcome related to these audits.

In conjunction with the IRS income tax audit, certain of our US payroll tax returns are
currently under examination for fiscal years 1999 — 2001, and we received a second NOPA in the
amount of $11.7 million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing of tax
deposits related to employee stock option exercises. We responded to this NOPA in February 2005,
and intend to dispute this assessment with the IRS. An initial appeals conference was held on
January 31, 2006. We currently do not believe that a liability can be reasonably estimated at this
time. In the event that this issue is resolved unfavorably to us, there exists the possibility of
a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which an unfavorable
outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.

ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year covered by this report.

PART II

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities

(a)

Our common stock has been quoted on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol “JNPR” since
June 25, 1999. Prior to that time, there was no public market for the common stock. All stock
information has been adjusted to reflect the three-for-one split, effected in the form of a
stock dividend to each stockholder of record as of December 31, 1999 and a two-for-one split,
effected in the form of a stock dividend to each stockholder of record as of May 15, 2000.
Juniper Networks has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and has no present plans to
do so. There were approximately 1,650 stockholders of record at January 31, 2006 and we
believe we have a substantially larger number of beneficial owners. The following table sets
forth the high and low closing bid prices as reported on NASDAQ:

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Report”), including the “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, contains forward-looking statements
regarding future events and the future results of our Company that are based on current
expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which



we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as ‘expects,’
‘anticipates,’ ‘targets,’ ‘goals,’ ‘projects,’ ‘intends,’ ‘plans,’ ‘believes,’ ‘seeks,’
‘estimates,’ variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject
to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results
may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.
Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those
discussed in this Report under the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I and
elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),
specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to revise or update
publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.

The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On
an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, sales
returns, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets,
especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and
obsolete material charges, tax, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.

Overview of the Results of Operations

To aid in understanding our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005, we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and
a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful.

Significant Events

Business Acquisitions

We completed a total of six acquisitions in the three years ended December 31, 2005. The main
purposes of these acquisitions were to expand our product portfolio and customer base. The
results of the following acquisitions have been included in our consolidated statements of
operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates.

The following is a summary of our acquisitions:

Year Ended December 31, 2005:



Year Ended December 31, 2004:

•

NetScreen Technologies, Inc. (“NetScreen”) acquired on April 16, 2004: Developed and
sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises, carriers,
and government entities.

Acquisition Related Liabilities

In connection with our acquisitions, we recorded liabilities associated with severance, future
lease, and other obligations. The initial liabilities were recorded as part of the acquisitions
and did not impact the Statements of Operations. The following is a summary of these liabilities:

•

In 2005, we recorded liabilities of $4.5 million for the five acquisitions of that
year, primarily related to future lease, severance, and other contractual
obligations. As of December 31, 2005, there was $2.6 million remaining to be paid
primarily related to future lease, severance, and other contractual obligations.

•

At the time of the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, we accrued $21.3 million primarily
related to professional services, severance and facility charges. There is
approximately $3.1 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that
extend through 2008.

•

At the time of the acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc. (“Unisphere”) in 2002,
we accrued $14.8 million primarily related to professional services, severance and
facility charges. There is approximately $1.2 million remaining to be paid,
primarily for facility leases that extend through March 2011.

Segments

As a result of these six acquisitions, we now offer two categories of products as well as
services organized into the following three operating segments:

•

Infrastructure: Products consist of the original Juniper Networks router portfolio
and Acorn products.

•

Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”): Products include the Funk, Peribit, Redline,
Kagoor, and NetScreen products.

•

Service: Delivers world-wide services to customers of the Infrastructure and SLT
segments.

Acceleration of Unvested and “Out-of-the-Money” Employee Stock Options

On December 16, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of
certain unvested and “out-of-the-money” stock options that had an exercise price per share equal to
or greater than $22.00, all of which were previously granted under our stock option plans and that
were outstanding on December 16, 2005. Options to purchase approximately 21.2 million shares of
common stock or 49.3% of our total outstanding unvested options on December 16, 2005 were
accelerated. The options accelerated excluded options previously granted to certain employees,
including all of our executive officers and our directors.

In
addition, the acceleration of the unvested and “out-of-the-money” options was accompanied by
restrictions imposed on any shares purchased through the exercise of accelerated options. Those
restrictions will prevent the sale of any such shares prior to the date such shares would have
originally vested had the optionee been employed on such date, whether or not the optionee is
actually an employee at that time.

The purpose of the acceleration was to enable us to avoid recognizing compensation expense
associated with these options in future periods in our Statements of Operations pursuant to
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123R (“SFAS 123R”). Under SFAS 123R, we will
apply the expense recognition provisions relating to stock options beginning in the first quarter
of fiscal 2006. In approving the acceleration, our Board considered its impact on future financial
results, stockholder value and employee retention. We believe that the acceleration of the
unvested and “out-of-the-money” options was in the best interest of stockholders as it will reduce our reported
compensation expense in future periods in light of these accounting regulations. As a result of the
acceleration, we expect to reduce the pre-tax stock option expense we otherwise would have been
required to record by approximately $153 million subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R beginning
in 2006. The acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge to our results
of operations in 2005.



The rules regarding option expensing are relatively recent. It is possible that changes
to existing rules, adoption of new rules or the promulgation of rulings or interpretations by the
Securities and Exchange Commission or other bodies, could cause the ultimate accounting treatment
of our options to vary from our current expectations, and if applied to periods prior to such
changes or rulings, could result in changes to historically reported financial information.

Restructuring and Other Related Charges

Restructuring Reserves

We initiated restructuring plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus on
strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align product and operating
expenses with existing general economic conditions. The following is a summary of our
restructuring plans charged to operating expenses in the Statements of Operations:

•

In 2004, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the acquisition of
NetScreen. We initially recorded a charge of approximately $0.4 million primarily
related to workforce reduction costs, which has been completely paid out as of December
31, 2005.

•

In 2003, we implemented a restructuring plan, under which we announced that we would
no longer develop our G-series CMTS products and recorded a charge that was comprised of
workforce reduction costs, non-inventory asset impairment, costs associated with
vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs. We initially
recorded a charge of approximately $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce
reduction costs, non-inventory asset impairment, vacating facilities costs, the costs
associated with termination of contracts and other related costs. As of December 31,
2005, approximately $1.4 million remained unpaid primarily for a facility lease that
extends through July 2008.

•

In 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the Unisphere
acquisition. We initially recorded a charge of $14.9 million, of which approximately
$0.7 million remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005, primarily for facility leases that
extend through April 2009.

During 2005 and 2004, we adjusted our restructuring reserves primarily due to changes in lease
and sublease assumptions as our needs changed as a result of our recent acquisitions and as the
real estate markets changed.

See Note 5 in Item 8 for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts
remained to be paid.

Impairment Charges

We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered
impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected
to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment charge to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.
We assess the recoverability of our long-lived and intangible assets by determining whether the
unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related
assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net
cash flows. In December 2005, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.9 million related to certain
Kagoor purchased intangibles as a result of a significant reduction in our forecasted revenue
associated with Kagoor products.

Debt Retirement

Through December 31, 2004, we paid a total of $937.0 million to retire all of our remaining
4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2007 (“Subordinated Notes”). These transactions
affected our cash and cash equivalents, investments, interest income and interest expense.

Tax Repatriation

We repatriated $225.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act (“Jobs Act”) in 2005. We
recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation dividend. The net
tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax



provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million, offset by a tax benefit of $29.4 million
related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un-repatriated earnings.

Nature of Expenses

We have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and
increase sales. We have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2005 and
2004.

Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent
contract manufacturers; accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our
independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract
manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and
standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are
conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent
contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, and the United States.
We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract
manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment.

The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual
component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for
carrying or obsolete material charges.

Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and
we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions,
bonuses, vacation, benefits and travel. We added over 420 and 900 employees in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, across all functions as a result of acquisitions. We had 4,145, 2,948, and 1,553
employees as of December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments
based on headcount. These departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to
increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional
infrastructure systems to support our growth. We expect these costs to stabilize in 2006.

Research and development expenses include:

•

the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products,

•

outside services for such services as certifications of new products, and

•

expenditures associated with equipment used for testing.

Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures,
such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of
which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our research and development
costs as they are incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research and development during
2006 compared to 2005 to further advance our competitive advantage.

Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services,
demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs vary quarter-to-quarter depending on
revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. We plan to further develop our distribution
channel in 2006 in an effort to expand and grow our presence in new markets, serving both private
and public networks with a full portfolio of networking products.

General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other
corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate
strategic services.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and
expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our
estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical



experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us
may differ materially and adversely from management’s estimates. To the extent there are material
differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be
affected.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments
and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:



quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
use of materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred in correcting any
product failure. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery
costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required, which could
reduce gross margins.

•

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets.

Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if
any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the
net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The amounts and useful lives assigned to other
intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization, and the amount
assigned to in-process research and development is expensed immediately. The value of our
intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as:
(i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of
technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common stock, (iii) significant
slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry or (iv) failure to meet the
performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results. We evaluate
these assets on an annual basis as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe
indicators of impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment review, we use the
income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as
well as the market approach to determine the fair value of our intangible assets.
Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results
that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have used
are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is
possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual
results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the
original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur
additional impairment charges.

•

Income Taxes

. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax
liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets,
which arise from temporary differences and carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income
in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled.
Deferred tax assets attributable to tax deductions related to stock options are not
considered realizable prior to their utilization on tax returns, at which point a current
tax savings results and equity is credited for such savings. We regularly assess the
likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or
recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS
109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes,”

and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred
tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable. We believe
it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the
deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax
assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to
be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to
earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize
deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective
valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a
decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation
of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex
tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and
the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately
proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being
recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our
estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge
to expense would result.

•

Litigation and Settlement Costs.

From time to time, we are involved in disputes,
litigation and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation
matters, however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and we
cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be
resolved without costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition the
resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty
payments, which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods. If any of those
events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum
estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency when both of the following
conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements
indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been
incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be
reasonably estimated. However the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially
different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional expenses.



•

Loss Contingencies.

We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies
arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or
impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to
reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated
loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We
regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals
should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.

Results of Operations

The increases in revenues, cost of expenses, and operating expenses in 2005 compared to 2004
are attributable to, to a certain extent, the inclusion of the results of operations from Funk,
Acorn, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor for part of 2005, and NetScreen for the full year in 2005.
Revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses were significantly greater during 2004 compared
to 2003 due to the NetScreen acquisition.

Our total net revenues increased to $2,064.0 million in 2005 and represents a growth of 54%
from 2004. Our total net revenues increased to $1,336.0 million in 2004 and represents a growth of
90% from 2003.

Product Net Revenues

The $608.1 million or 52% increase in our net product revenue from 2004 to 2005 was primarily
a result of the adoption and expansion of IP networks by our customers in order to reduce total
operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network and as a result of
the expansion of our product portfolio through acquisitions and internal development. During 2005,
we recognized $32.7 million of product revenue from product shipments made to end-users and
value-added resellers that were deferred as of December 31, 2004.

Infrastructure products accounted for $1,367.8 million or 77% of our total product net
revenues during 2005. Infrastructure product net revenue grew by 40% from 2004 to 2005, primarily
due to the increase in revenues from service providers and enterprises.

SLT products accounted for $403.2 million or 23% of our total product net revenues during
2005. Our SLT product revenue was primarily driven by the increased demand by the enterprise
market. Our higher net revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to the revenue growth
from Security products. Additionally, the acquisitions made in 2005 enabled us to cross sell
infrastructure, security, and application acceleration products to existing customer bases. An
analysis of the change in revenue by Infrastructure and SLT segments, and the change in units, can
be found below in the section titled “Segment Information.”

Net product revenue increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily as a result of the increase in
Infrastructure product shipments to meet the customers’ capital expenditures demands, and to a
lesser extent, due to SLT net revenue related to the NetScreen acquisition.

Service Net Revenues

Net service revenues increased $119.9 million or 69% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the
growth in support services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. The growth
in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base.
We recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the
period of the obligation. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase
our products and enter into service contracts that are typically for one-year renewable periods.



Net service revenues increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily as a result of the increase in
installed base of customers and products.

We continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic theaters,
and we expect this trend to continue. Net revenue in the United States as a percentage of total
net revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth driven by increased
demand within the service provider and enterprise markets. Net revenue in EMEA as a percentage of
total net revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to strength across the region,
including Finland, Greece, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom. Net revenue in
Japan as a percentage of total net revenue decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to
completion by customers of several network expansion projects and a pause in the build out of their
next generation network, or NGN. Net revenue in other Asia Pacific countries as a percentage of
total net revenue remained fairly consistent with prior years.

In 2004, net revenue in the Americas region grew as a percentage of total net revenue due to
the improvement in customer spending in the United States.

Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net product and service revenues for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. Ericsson accounted for greater than 10% of our net
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003. We expect that our largest customers, as well as
key strategic partners, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in
2006 and for the foreseeable future.

Reclassifications have been made to product costs in 2004 and 2003 to include related stock
compensation expense to conform to the current year presentation.

The two percentage points decrease in product gross margins from 2004 to 2005 was primarily
due to increasing competition as certain of our products have become more mature in their product
cycles. As we have expanded our market share and entered more markets since 2004, we have begun to
experience increased price competition. This price competition has been limited to date, as
evidenced by our increase in revenue dollars compared to the year-ago period as well as relatively
comparable product gross margins from year to year. We expect to see increasing price competition
and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future. Nevertheless, higher product
revenue volume contributed to the increased gross margin by $420.1 million, or 50% in 2005 when
compared to 2004.



The six percentage points increase in product gross margins from 2003 to 2004 was primarily
due to cost-cutting initiatives that resulted in standard costs and manufacturing support costs
increasing at a lesser rate than product net revenues in terms of absolute dollars for the same
periods. In addition, the standard margins on the original NetScreen products are more favorable
than the standard margins on the Infrastructure products and NetScreen’s acquisition in 2004
contributed to the increases compared to prior year. The improvement in gross margins was also a
result of a $16.0 million reduction in carrying and obsolescence charges from 2003 to 2004 as our
historical charges paid to the contract manufacturers decreased. The increase in gross margins was
partially offset by acquisition charges related to the NetScreen acquisition, which increased cost
of product revenues by $5.5 million, for an inventory fair value adjustment and the amortization of
the order backlog intangible asset.

Service gross margins increased five percentage points from 2004 to 2005 and was primarily
attributable to a larger revenue increase when compared to the increase in headcount, outside
services, and spares purchases, all of which were needed to support the growing installed base.
Total employee related expenses as a percentage of service revenue for 2005 decreased to 22%
compared to 26% for 2004. Nevertheless, in absolute dollars, total service related costs increased
in 2005 compared to 2004: employee related expenses increased $20.2 million, and outside service
expenses increased by $17.5 million as a result of increased headcount during 2005. In addition,
expense associated with spares increased by $7.1 million.

Service gross margins increased two percentage points from 2003 to 2004 as a result of
improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger installed base,
and thus a more leveraged service organization. This increased leverage was evidenced by the fact
that total employee related expenses decreased as a percentage of service revenue: 26% for 2004 and
27% for 2003; however, in absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased $18.5 million from
2003 to 2004. The increases in absolute dollars were due to the NetScreen acquisition. In
addition, in absolute dollars, outside services costs increased $9.3 million from 2003 to 2004,
primarily due to the NetScreen acquisition. Finally, the costs associated with spare parts
decreased as a percent of service revenue from 2003 to 2004 and remained approximately the same in
terms of absolute dollars.

Reclassifications were made to the 2004 and 2003 amounts to include related stock compensation
expense to conform to the current year presentation.

Research and development expenses increased $95.5 million in 2005 compared to 2004, but
decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due
to increases in personnel related expenses of $66.4 million, facility related expenses of $14.1
million, engineering and testing expenses of $12.6 million, equipment related expenses of $8.5
million, and depreciation of $5.1 million. The increases in personnel related expenses in 2005
were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization, including those from the
five acquisitions. The increase is partially offset by the decrease in stock compensation expense
of $11.6 million compared to 2004 as a result of forfeitures of unvested options in 2005. We
continue to invest in both stand-alone as well as integrated products in order to satisfy our
customer needs. In addition, we invested and expanded on our global research and development
efforts, specifically in China and India.

Research and development expenses increased $81.9 million in 2004 compared to 2003, but
decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due
to employee related expenses increasing $42.4 million year-over-year as a result of the NetScreen
acquisition. The increase in research and development expenses was also the result of a $6.5
million increase in expensed equipment primarily used in test activities and a $5.6 million
increase in prototype expense. The increase in expensed equipment was due to additional research
and development requirements resulting from the NetScreen acquisition. Prototype expenses are
closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product
can be offered to the public, and the amounts reported in a given period can vary depending on the
product being developed and the timing



of the release. Stock compensation expense increased by $19.6 million due to the additional
amortization of stock options assumed from the NetScreen acquisition.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $119.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and decreased
as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to
increases in personnel related expenses of $97.3 million, increases in marketing related activities
of $10.9 million, and increases in equipment related expenses of $2.6 million. Personnel related
expenses increased in 2005 primarily due to additional hires, including acquisitions, to support
the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base, as well as to support the larger
portfolio of products. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific
activities designed to expand and improve our distribution channels, introduction of new products,
and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers. The increase was
partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of $12.9 million compared to 2004 due
primarily to the forfeitures of unvested options in 2005.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $174.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased
as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee
related expenses increasing $104.7 million year-over-year as a result of the NetScreen acquisition
and the increase in revenue. Marketing related expenses increased $22.3 million due to the
NetScreen acquisition, the branding of the combined companies and the development of a distribution
channel and channel sales. Outside services increased $7.0 million due to professional services
related to marketing activities. In addition, demonstration equipment increased $6.4 million due
to the NetScreen acquisition and the related purchase of Security demonstration products for our
direct sales force and resellers. Demonstration equipment is expensed immediately and is closely
tied to product launches. Stock compensation expense increased by $17.5 million due to the
additional amortization of stock options assumed from the NetScreen acquisition.

General and administrative expenses increased $19.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and
remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in
personnel related expenses of $10.6 million and a $10.0 million patent related expense . The $10.0
million patent expense pertained to an agreement we entered into with a third-party to avoid future
disputes. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of $0.9
million compared to 2004 due primarily to the forfeitures of unvested options in 2005.

General and administrative expenses increased $26.8 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and
remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by a $13.6
million increase in professional services and a $9.3 million increase in employee related expenses.
Stock compensation expense increased by $2.0 million due to the additional amortization of stock
options assumed from the NetScreen acquisition.

Amortization of Purchased Intangibles

The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $28.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004
primarily due to the additional intangible assets from the five acquisitions completed in 2005. In
addition, we recognized less than a full year of amortization expense for the intangible assets
associated with the NetScreen acquisition in 2004.

The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $36.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003
due to the intangible assets purchased in the NetScreen acquisition.

See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets.



In-Process Research and Development

In 2005, a total of $11.0 million was charged to IPR&D expense in connection with three of our
five acquisitions during the year. Of the total Funk purchase price, $5.3 million was allocated to
in-process research and development (“IPR&D”). Of the total Peribit purchase price, $3.8 million
was allocated to IPR&D. Of the total Kagoor purchase price, $1.9 million was allocated to IPR&D.
None of the Acorn or Redline purchase prices were allocated to IPR&D. In 2004, $27.5 million was
allocated to IPR&D from the NetScreen acquisition and was expensed during the year.

Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not yet reached technological
feasibility and which have no alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being
equivalent to a beta-phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the
development. At the time of acquisition, Funk, Peribit, Kagoor, and NetScreen had multiple IPR&D
efforts under way for certain current and future product lines.

For Funk, these efforts included development of new versions for the Steel-Belted Radius
(“SBR”), SBR High Availability (“HA”), and Mobile IP Module (“MIM”) II products — all related to
the Radius product offering. IPR&D as of the acquisition date also included development of new
versions for Endpoint Assurance, Proxy (Remote Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time
of the Funk acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the
next four months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.9 million.

For Peribit, these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the
Sequence Reducer (“SR”) family, Sequence Mirror (“SM”) family, the Central Management System
(“CMS”) products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of
the Peribit acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over
the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million.

For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation
products and operating systems. At the time of the Kagoor acquisition, it was estimated that these
development efforts would be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of
approximately $0.8 million.

As of December 31, 2005, the estimated costs to complete the above research and development
efforts were approximately $2.0 million.

For NetScreen, these efforts included integrating secure routers with embedded encryption
chips, as well as other functions and features such as next generation Internet Protocol (“IP”),
wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability. We utilized the
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method to value the IPR&D, using rates ranging from 20% to 25%,
depending on the estimated useful life of the technology. In applying the DCF method, the value of
the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected
to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated, over the remaining
economic life of the technology. To distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the
underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating
product revenues, adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working
capital, and other assets that provide value to the product lines. At the time of the NetScreen
acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next
eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately $25 million. As of December 31, 2005, there
was no remaining costs associated with these research and development efforts

Restructuring, Impairments, and Special Charges

We implemented several restructuring plans from 2002 to 2004 as a result of product
discontinuation and the acquisitions of Unisphere and NetScreen. Restructuring, impairments, and
special charges in 2005 included adjustments of $6.6 million primarily related to our restructuring
accruals when we re-occupied a portion of the former NetScreen facility previously included in the
acquisition related reserve. The credit was partially offset by a $5.9 million charge associated
with the impairment of our purchased intangible assets related to Kagoor.

Integration Costs

We incurred immaterial integration expenses for the five 2005 acquisitions and approximately
$5.1 million for the NetScreen acquisition in 2004. Integration expenses are incremental costs
directly related to the integration of the two companies. The integration expenses consisted
principally of facility related expenses, workforce related expenses and professional fees. We
estimate that the majority of the integration costs related to our 2005 and 2004 acquisitions have
been incurred and that there will be an immaterial amount of additional integration costs for these
acquisitions in the foreseeable future.

Interest and other income increased $30.9 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of higher
cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, and an increase in rates of return realized from
our investments.

Interest and other income decreased $5.2 million from 2003 to 2004. The decreases were the
result of lower rates of return realized from our investments and less realized gains.

Interest and other expenses decreased $1.5 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the
retirement of the subordinated notes during 2004, resulting in savings of $2.5 million, which was
partially offset by foreign exchange related losses from balance sheet revaluation and bank fees.

Interest expense decreased $33.7 million from 2003 to 2004, almost entirely due to interest
saved from the retirement of our Subordinated Notes.

We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at
cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the
ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. We wrote-down these investments by
$0.4 million and $2.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, for changes in market value that we
believed were other than temporary.

In 2005, we recorded a gain of $1.7 million in connection with a business combination
transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio. Our cost basis of this
equity investment was $1.0 million.

During 2003, we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as
available-for-sale, which had a cost basis of $4.3 million, and recognized gains of $8.7 million.

We spent $145.0 million, and $792.0 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, to retire our
Subordinated Notes. We recognized net losses of $4.1 million and $1.1 million during 2004 and
2003, respectively. The losses were a result of the difference between the carrying value of the
Subordinated Notes at the time of their retirement, including unamortized debt costs, and the
amount paid to extinguish such notes.

Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes increased to $148.2 million in 2005 from $83.3 million in 2004.
The 2005 effective rate was 29.5% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily
to the benefit of tax credits and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the
repatriation dividend under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We repatriated $225.0 million
in 2005. We recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation
dividend. The net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax provision, net of federal
benefit, of $9.7 million, offset by a tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an adjustment of
deferred tax liabilities on un-repatriated earnings.

Provision for income taxes increased to $83.3 million in 2004 from $19.8 million in 2003. The
2004 effective rate was 38% and reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions, the
benefit of tax credits and the inability to benefit certain charges and losses.

Segment Information

A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. We began to track financial information by our three operating
segments during 2005 as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the business
based on management operating income.



We have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005 for comparative purposes.

Financial information for each operating segment used by management to make financial
decisions and allocate resources is as follows (in millions):

Infrastructure Operating Segment

Infrastructure segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 due to
the adoption and expansion of IP networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs
and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. The following table shows
infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped:

Infrastructure chassis revenue units

9,828

7,102

Infrastructure ports shipped

153,763

114,543

73,471

We track infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends
and indicate areas of potential network growth. Our infrastructure product platforms are
essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a
certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules
or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of
data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium
and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on
the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number
of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period.

Management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to
increases in revenue as evident by the increase in chassis revenue units. The increase was
partially offset by higher personnel related costs primarily related to support product innovation
and the expansion of our sales channels.

Service Layer Technologies Operating Segment

SLT segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to
the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, and to a lesser extent, the Funk, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor
acquisitions and increases in the sales of firewall products in 2005.



Management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to
increases in net revenue, partially offset by increased expenses primarily related to product
innovation and the expansion of our sales channels. Additionally, the purchase accounting
adjustments related to the NetScreen acquisition negatively impacted the revenue and management
operating results in 2004.

Service Operating Segment

Net service revenues increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth in support
services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support
services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base. Service
management operating income increased as a result of the revenue growth experienced in the
Infrastructure segment and the SLT segment, partially offset by increases in operating costs,
primarily due to personnel related costs. However, in absolute dollars, employee related expenses
increased as a result of increased headcounts. Expenses associated with spares also increased as a
result of revenue growth.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

following table shows our capital resources (in millions):

As of December 31,

917.6

Working capital increased $273.5 million from 2004 to 2005 due to cash provided by operations
of $642.9 million, partially offset by net cash used in investing activities. The significant
components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and
accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working
capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with
our existing operations through at least the next 12 months. In addition, there are no
transactions, arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons
that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements
for capital resources.

Cash Requirements and Contractual Obligations

We occupy approximately 1.4 million square feet world wide under operating leases. The
majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in
Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in May 2014.



(b)

Our principal commitment as of December 31, 2005 was our outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible
Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (“Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003
and are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of payment with all of our
existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future
debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes bear no
interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions,
at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion
rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances. The carrying value of the Senior Notes as of December
31, 2005 was $400.0 million.

(c)

We do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. In order to reduce
manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers
place non-cancelable, non-returnable (“NCNR”) orders, which were valued at $78.1 million as of
December 31, 2005, based on our build forecasts. We do not take ownership of the components
and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with
the contract manufacturers. The components are used by the contract manufacturers to build
products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers. We do not incur a
liability for products built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customer’s
order and the order ships. However, if the components go unused, we may be assessed carrying
charges or obsolete charges. As of December 31, 2005, we had accrued $21.6 million based on
our estimate of such charges.

(d)

Other Contractual obligations consist of the following:

•

Escrow amount of $12.2 million related to the Funk acquisition for indemnity
obligations. One-half of the indemnity obligations will expire in January 2007 and the
remaining one-half will expire in June 2007. Also included is a contingent bonus
payable, based on certain milestones, of $5 million, which will be earned over a period
of one year.

•

Escrow amount of $1.5 million related to the Acorn acquisition for indemnity
obligations. The indemnity obligations will expire in May 2007. Also included is a
contingent earn-out payable to former Acorn stockholders, based on certain milestones,
of up to $2.2 million, and bonus payable to employees related to continued employment of
up to $1.0 million. Earn-out and bonuses will be earned over a period of two years.

•

Escrow amount related to the Redline and Kagoor acquisitions of $13.2 million and
$6.8 million, respectively, for indemnity obligations. The indemnity obligations will
expire in May 2006.

In connection with the Peribit acquisition, 1.6 million shares of our common stock, with a fair
value of $35.2 million as of acquisition date, have been held in escrow for indemnity
obligations. We did not include this obligation in the above table since it is a non-cash item.
One-half of the indemnity obligations will expire in July 2006 and the remaining one-half will
expire in January 2007.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $642.9 million, $439.4 million, and $178.6
million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The cash provided by
operating activities for each period was due to our net income adjusted by:

•

Non-cash charges of $304.0 million, $246.5 million, and $76.8 million for 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, primarily for depreciation and amortization expenses, stock-based
compensation, tax benefit of employee stock option plans, in-process research and
development from acquisitions, debt issuance costs, loss on disposal of property and
equipment, restructuring expense, and impairment charges associated with Kagoor’s purchased
intangible assets. Non-cash charges in 2005 also included a benefit from the reversal of
NetScreen’s acquisition related liabilities and a loss due to the impairment of an equity
investment, partially offset by gains associated with available-for-sale investments. In
2004, non-cash charges also included a loss from the redemption of the Subordinated Notes
and a loss due to the write-down of equity investments. In 2003, non-cash charges also
included a loss from the redemption of the Subordinated Notes, offset by a gain from the
sale of equity investment.



•

Changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(15.1) million, $57.2 million, and $62.5
million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were in the normal course of business. Net
cash used during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was primarily attributable to
increases in net accounts receivable of $68.0 million, prepaid expenses, other current
assets, and other long-term assets of $26.2 million, decreases in accrued warranty of $3.7
million, and decreases in other accrued liabilities of $42.6 million, partially offset by
increases in deferred revenue of $64.3 million, accounts payable of $50.3 million, and
accrued compensation of $10.9 million. Net cash provided during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue of $93.6
million, accrued compensation of $40.3 million, other accrued liabilities of $27.9 million,
accounts payable of $29.4 million, and accrued warranty of $3.6 million, partially offset
by increases in net accounts receivable of $81.4 million, and prepaid expenses, other
current assets, and other long-term assets of $56.3 million. Net cash used during the
twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was primarily attributable to increase in deferred
revenue of $29.2 million, accrued compensation of $17.5 million, accounts payable of $13.0
million, accrued warranty of $3.0 million, and other accrued liabilities of $2.5 million,
partially offset by decreased in prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other
long-term assets of $3.1 million. Deferred revenue increased during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increases in deferred service revenue as a result
of the growth in the Service business, partially offset by revenue recognized from deferred
product revenue. Deferred revenue increased during the twelve months ended December 31,
2004 primarily due to increases in deferred product revenue, and to a lesser degree,
increases in deferred service revenue.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $583.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Net cash used in investing activities was $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net
cash provided by investing activities was $300.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Investing activities included capital expenditures and the purchases and sale or maturities of
available-for-sale securities, the purchase and sale of equity investments, and the acquisitions of
businesses. Capital expenditures increased from 2004 to 2005 mainly due to new product
developments and overseas expansions, and business acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased
from 2003 to 2004 due to our business growth. Other investing activities include:

•

$309.9 million of cash used in the acquisitions of Funk, Acorn, Peribit, Redline, and
Kagoor during 2005, $34.8 million of restricted cash funded to escrow accounts in relation
to the Funk, Acorn, Redline, and Kagoor acquisitions, and $9.8 million of investment in a
private equity company during 2005;

•

$40.9 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the NetScreen
acquisition during 2004, and;

•

$30.8 million of restricted cash funded during 2003 to establish a trust to secure our
indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided in financing activities was $146.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2005. Net cash used in financing activities was $33.4 million and $307.5 million for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash was provided during all periods from the
issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans. We spent
$145.0 million, and $792.0 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, to retire our Subordinated
Notes. We spent $63.6 million during 2004 to retire 2.9 million shares of our common stock.
During 2003, we received net proceeds of $392.8 million from the issuance of the Senior Notes. In
January and February of 2006, we repurchased 10,071,000 shares of common stock at an average price
of $18.51 per share as part of our Common Stock Repurchase Program. The repurchase did not have a
material impact on our liquidity.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement
No. 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS 123R”),

Share-Based Payment,

which is a revision of FASB Statement
No. 123 (“SFAS 123”),

Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees.

SFAS 123R supersedes APB
Opinion No. 25 (“APB 25”),

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and amends FASB Statement No.
95,

Statement of Cash Flows.



Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123.
However, SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma
disclosure is no longer an alternative. We adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006.

SFAS 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:
modified prospective method or modified retrospective method. We plan to adopt SFAS 123R using the
modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective
date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after the
effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees
prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. We will
recognize in our results of operations the compensation cost for stock-based awards issued after
December 31, 2005 on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
For stock-based awards issued prior to January 1, 2006, we amortize the related compensation costs
using the graded-vesting method.

As permitted by SFAS 123, we currently account for share-based payments to employees using APB
25 intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock
options. The adoption of the SFAS 123R fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on
our reported results of operations because the stock-based compensation expense will be charged
directly against our reported earnings. The pre-tax balance of unearned stock-based compensation to
be expensed in the period 2006 through 2010 related to share-based awards unvested as of December
31, 2005, as previously calculated under the disclosure-only requirements of SFAS 123, was
approximately $98 million. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying
unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase, or cancel any remaining unearned
stock-based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to
employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions, our stock-based
compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those
additional grants or acquisitions. We anticipate we will grant additional employee stock options
and restricted stock units in 2006. The fair value of these grants is not included in the amount
above, as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it depends on the
number of share-based payments granted and the then current fair values.

SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required
under current standard. This requirement will likely reduce net operating cash flow and increase
net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While we cannot estimate what those amounts
will be in the future as they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock
options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax
deductions were $129.5 million, $66.0 million, and $10.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123R-3,

Transition Election and Accounting for Tax
Effects.

The guidance provides a simplified method to calculate the Additional Paid-In Capital
(APIC) pool for the beginning balance of excess tax benefits and the method of determining the
subsequent impact on the pool of option awards that are outstanding and fully or partially vested
upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment,

beginning on January 1, 2006. In
addition, this FSP addresses that when the alternative APIC pool calculation is used, tax benefits
related to certain employee awards should be included as a cash flow from financing activities and
a cash outflow from operating activities within the statements of cash flows. The FSP allows
companies up to one year from the later of the adoption date of SFAS 123R or November 10, 2005 to
evaluate the available transition alternatives and make a one-time election. We are in the process
of evaluating the impact of the new method provided by this guidance.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These
securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value
of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact
on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate
exposures.

These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The
modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes
in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve
of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the
historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate.

Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

It is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in
foreign currencies. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

We uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated
by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These derivatives are
carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense). Changes in the fair value
of these derivatives are largely offset by re-measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities.
These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months.

Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and/or option contracts to hedge certain
forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are
designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of
the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently
reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged
transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was
immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, in other income (expense) in
our results of operations.



ITEM 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Juniper Networks Inc.’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over the company’s financial reporting. We assessed the effectiveness of the
company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this
assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment using those criteria, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2005,
Juniper Networks Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Juniper Networks Inc.’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP,
audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and have issued an
audit report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting.
This report appears on page 43 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Please note that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal
control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect
to financial statement preparation. Further because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of
internal control may vary over time.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Juniper Networks, Inc. as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Juniper Networks, Inc. at December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Juniper Networks, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated March 3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Juniper Networks, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the 2005 consolidated financial statements of Juniper Networks, Inc. and our
report dated March 3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of Business

Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks” or the “Company”) was founded in 1996 to develop
and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of service providers. Today the
Company designs and sells products and services that together provide its customers with secured
and assured Internet Protocol (“IP”) secure networking solutions. The Company’s solutions are
incorporated into the global web of interconnected public and private networks across which a
variety of media, including voice, video and data, travel to and from end users around the world.
The Company’s network infrastructure solutions enable service providers and other network-intensive
businesses to support and deliver services and applications on a highly efficient and low cost
integrated network. The Company’s Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”) solutions meet a broad array
of its customer’s priorities, from protecting the network itself, and protecting data on the
network, to maximizing existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications across a distributed
network. Together, the Company’s secure networking solutions enable its customers to convert
networks that provide commoditized, best efforts services into more valuable assets that provide
differentiation and value and increased reliability and security to end users. The Company sells
and markets its products through its direct sales organization, value-added resellers and
distributors.

In 2005 the Company completed the acquisitions of Funk Software, Inc. (“Funk”), Acorn Packet
Solutions, Inc. (“Acorn”), Peribit Networks, Inc. (“Peribit”), Redline Networks, Inc (“Redline”),
and Kagoor Networks, Inc. (“Kagoor”). In 2004 the Company completed its acquisition of NetScreen
Technologies, Inc. (“NetScreen”). As a result of the these acquisitions, the Company expanded its
customer base and portfolio of products, and now offers two categories of networking products:
infrastructure products, which consist predominately of the original Juniper Networks router
portfolio and Acorn products, and SLT products, which consist predominately of the former Funk,
Peribit, Redline, Kagoor, and NetScreen products.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying notes. Estimates are used for revenue recognition, allowance for sales returns,
allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for contract manufacturer obligations, allowance for
warranty costs, goodwill and other impairments, income taxes, litigation and settlement costs, and
other loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and also on
assumptions that it believes are standard and reasonable. Actual results experienced by the
Company may differ materially from management’s estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are
classified as cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand,
balances with banks, and highly liquid investments in money market funds, commercial paper,
government securities, certificates of deposit, and corporate debt securities.

Investments

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and
reevaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date. Realized gains and losses and
declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific
identification method and are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company’s
investments in publicly traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale investments are initially recorded at cost and periodically adjusted to fair
value through comprehensive income.



Equity Investments

Juniper Networks has investments in privately held companies. These investments are included
in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are carried at cost, adjusted for
any impairment, as the Company does not have a controlling interest and does not have the ability
to exercise significant influence over these companies. These investments are inherently high risk
as the market for technologies or products manufactured by these companies are usually early stage
at the time of the investment by Juniper Networks and such markets may never be significant. The
Company monitors these investments for impairment by considering financial, operational and
economic data and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accrued compensation, and other accrued liabilities, approximates fair market
value due to the relatively short period of time to maturity. The fair value of investments is
determined using quoted market prices for those securities or similar financial instruments.

Concentrations

Financial instruments that subject Juniper Networks to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. Juniper Networks
maintains its cash and cash equivalents and investments in fixed income securities with
high-quality institutions and only invests in high quality credit instruments. Deposits held with
banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may
be redeemed upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk.

Generally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due to the number of
entities comprising the Company’s customer base and their dispersion across different geographic
locations throughout the world. Juniper Networks performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. Juniper Networks
maintains reserves for potential credit losses and historically such losses have been within
management’s expectations. One customer accounted for 14% and 15% of total net revenues during
2005 and 2004, respectively. Two customers individually accounted for 15% and 13% of total net
revenues in 2003.

The Company relies on sole suppliers for certain of its components such as ASICs and custom
sheet metal. Additionally, Juniper Networks relies primarily on two significant independent
contract manufacturers for the production of all of its products. The inability of any supplier or
manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of Juniper Networks could negatively impact future
operating results.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life, generally
three to five years, or the lease term of the respective assets. The land that was acquired in
January 2001 is not being depreciated.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible
and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets resulting
from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are
estimated by management based on the fair value of assets received. Identifiable intangible assets
are comprised of purchased trademarks, developed technologies, customer and maintenance contracts,
and other intangible assets. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to annual
assessment, at a minimum, for impairment by applying a fair-value based test. Future goodwill
impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. Purchased intangibles with finite lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from two to
twelve years.



Impairment

The Company evaluates long-lived assets held-for-use for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is
considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected
to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured
by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. The Company
assesses the recoverability of our long-lived and intangible assets by determining whether the
unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related
assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net
cash flows.

The Company evaluates goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events and
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s
carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of
the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows,
approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the carrying value
of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is
performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Juniper Networks conducted its
annual impairment test as of November 1, 2005 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. There
were no events or circumstances from that date through December 31, 2005 that would impact this
assessment.

Revenue Recognition

Juniper Networks sells products and services through its direct sales force or through its
strategic distribution relationships and value-added resellers. The Company recognizes revenue
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales
price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement
generally consists of customer purchase orders and, in certain instances, sales contracts or
agreements. Shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when
applicable, are used to verify delivery or performance. The Company assesses whether the sales
price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to
refund or adjustment. Collectibility is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as
determined by credit checks and the customer’s payment history to the Company.

On arrangements where products and services are bundled, the Company determines whether the
deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting. The Company allocates the total fee
on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or
using the residual method, as circumstances dictate. The Company then recognizes revenue on each
deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition.

For sales to direct end-users and value-added resellers, the Company recognizes product
revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally
upon shipment. It is the Company’s practice to identify an end-user prior to shipment to
a value-added reseller. For the end-users and value-added
resellers, the Company has no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of
return or pricing credits. A portion of the Company’s sales are made through distributors under
agreements allowing for pricing credits and/or rights of return. Product revenue on sales made
through these distributors is recognized upon sell-through as reported by the distributors to the
Company.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing
adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is
recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection
credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time.

Shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping
costs are included in cost of product revenues. The Company’s resellers and distributors
participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and it maintains estimated
accruals and allowances for these programs.

Services include maintenance, training and consulting. Service maintenance includes contracts
for 24-hour technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, and unspecified upgrades on a
when and if available basis. Service maintenance is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts.
Revenue from customer support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual
support period, generally one year. Revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the
services are completed or ratably over the contractual period.



Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectibility
of customer accounts. Juniper Networks regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such
as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances and current
economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.

Warranties

Juniper Networks generally offers a one-year warranty on all of its hardware products and a
90-day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. The warranty
generally includes parts and labor obtained through the Company’s 24-hour service center. On
occasion, the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary. The Company accrues for
warranty costs based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under its warranty obligations,
including material costs, technical support labor costs and associated overhead. The warranty
accrual is included in the Company’s cost of revenues and is recorded at the time revenue is
recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number of installed
units, its estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims, costs per claim and estimated support
labor costs and the associated overhead. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of our
recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

Contract Manufacturer Liabilities

The Company outsources most of its manufacturing, repair and supply chain management
operations to its independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of its cost of
revenues consists of payments to them. Its independent contract manufacturers procure components
and manufacture the Company’s products based on the Company’s demand forecasts. These forecasts
are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand for the Company products, which are in turn
based on historical trends and an analysis from the Company’s sales and marketing organizations,
adjusted for overall market conditions. The Company establishes accrued liabilities, included in
other current accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, for carrying
charges and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends.

Research and Development

Costs to research, design, and develop the Company’s products are expensed as incurred.
Software development costs are capitalized beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has
been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers.
Generally, Juniper Networks’ products are released soon after technological feasibility has been
established. As a result, costs subsequent to achieving technological feasibility have not been
significant and all software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. Advertising expense
was $6.6 million, $7.9 million, and $1.3 million, for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Litigation and Settlement Costs

From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions.
The Company records a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss
contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to
issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired
or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss
can be reasonably estimated. However the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially
different from the Company’s estimates, which could result in the need to record additional
expenses.



Loss Contingencies

The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the
ordinary course of business. It considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the
incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in
determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that
an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to its
management to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are
required.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s stock option plans are accounted for under the intrinsic value recognition and
measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25 (“APB
25”),

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related
interpretations. As the exercise price of all options granted under these plans was equal to the
market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date, no stock-based employee compensation
cost, other than acquisition-related compensation cost, was recognized in net income.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the
Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123 (“SFAS 123”),

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

, to employee stock benefits, including shares issued under the stock
option plans and under the Company’s Stock Purchase Plan. Pro forma information, net of the tax
effect, follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

*During the
preparation of the notes to consolidated financial statements for 2005, the Company determined that the
calculation of the pro forma stock-based compensation expense
disclosed under SFAS 123 for 2004, as reported,
inadvertently did not include the proper fair value for options assumed in the acquisition in 2004. Accordingly, the
amount of the pro forma stock-based compensation expense presented in the table above for 2004 has been revised.
For 2004, the previously reported pro forma net income was $69.3 million, the previously reported pro forma basic net
income per share was $0.14, and the previously reported pro forma
diluted net income per share was $0.13. This
revision had no effect on the Company’s previously reported consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Derivatives

It is the Company’s policy to use derivatives to partially offset its market exposure to
fluctuations in foreign currencies. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or
trading purposes. Juniper Networks uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction
gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense).
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re-measurement of the
underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one
and two months.

Periodically, the Company uses foreign currency forward and/or option contracts to hedge
certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives
are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion
of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently
reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged
transaction relates. The Company records any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was
immaterial during 2005, 2004, and 2003, in other income (expense) on its Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Provision for Income Taxes

Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the
determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary
differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the
currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the



years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax assets
attributable to tax deductions related to stock options are not considered realizable prior to
their utilization on tax returns, at which point a current tax savings results and equity is
credited for such savings. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax
assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based
on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes,”

and records a
valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes to be more
likely than not realizable. The Company believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income
together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover
the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are
determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be
charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company
subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the
respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or
a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of
its tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations. The Company recognizes potential liabilities based on its estimate of whether, and
the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from non-owner
sources. The Company has presented its comprehensive income as part of the Consolidated Statements
of Stockholders’ Equity. Other comprehensive income includes net unrealized losses on
available-for-sale securities and net foreign currency translation gains (losses) that are excluded
from net income.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations with non-U.S. dollar functional currency are
translated to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and
expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. Foreign
currency translation gains and losses were not material for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies were
immaterial in the years presented.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement
No. 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS 123R”),

Share-Based
Payment,

which is a revision of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees.

SFAS 123R supersedes APB 25, and amends FASB Statement No.
95,

Statement of Cash Flows.

Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar to the approach
described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on
their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

SFAS 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:
modified prospective method or modified retrospective method. The Company plans to adopt SFAS 123R
using the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the
effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted
after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to
employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. The
Company will recognize in its results of operations the compensation cost for stock-based awards
issued after December 31, 2005 on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
entire award. For stock-based awards issued prior to January 1, 2006, the Company amortizes the
related compensation costs using the graded-vesting method.

As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using APB 25 intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation
cost for employee stock options. The adoption of the SFAS 123R fair value method will have a
significant adverse impact on the Company’s reported results of operations because the stock-based
compensation expense will be charged directly against the Company’s reported earnings. The pre-tax
balance of unearned stock-based compensation to be expensed in the period 2006 through 2010
related to share-based awards unvested as of December 31, 2005, as previously calculated under the
disclosure-only requirements of SFAS 123, is approximately $98 million. If there are any
modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, the Company may be required
to accelerate, increase, or cancel



any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. To the extent that the Company
grants additional equity securities to employees or assumes unvested securities in connection with
any acquisitions, its stock-based compensation expense will be increased by the additional
unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions. The Company
anticipates that it will grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in
2006. The fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above, as the impact of these
grants cannot be predicted at this time because it depends on the number of share-based payments
granted and the then current fair values.

SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required
under current standard. This requirement will likely reduce net operating cash flow and increase
net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what those
amounts will be in the future as they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock
options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax
deductions were $129.5 million, $66.0 million, and $10.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123R-3,

Transition Election and Accounting for Tax
Effects.

The guidance provides a simplified method to calculate the Additional Paid-In Capital
(APIC) pool for beginning balance of excess tax benefits and the method of determining the
subsequent impact on the pool of option awards that are outstanding and fully or partially vested
upon the adoption of SFAS 123R beginning on January 1, 2006. In addition, this FSP addresses that
when the alternative APIC pool calculation is used, tax benefits related to certain employee awards
should be included as a cash flow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating
activities within the statements of cash flows. The FSP allows companies up to one year from the
later of the adoption date of SFAS 123R or November 10, 2005 to evaluate the available transition
alternatives and make a one-time election. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact
of the new method provided by this guidance.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances in order to conform to the
current year’s presentation.

Note 3. Business Acquisitions

Juniper Networks completed six purchase acquisitions during the three years ended December 31,
2005. In 2005, the Company acquired Funk, Acorn, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor. In 2004, the

Allocation of Initial Purchase Consideration

The Company allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, including IPR&D, based on their fair values. The excess purchase price over
those fair values is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is subject to change due to the release of the
amounts held in escrow for indemnity obligations, additional contingent payments, and changes in
acquisition related assets and liabilities. The fair values assigned to intangible assets acquired
are based on valuations prepared by independent third party appraisal firms using estimates and
assumptions provided by management. A summary of the purchase price allocations for each
acquisition is as follows (in millions):

Existing technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility and
includes products in the acquired product lines. Existing technology was valued using the
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. This method calculates the value of the intangible asset as
being the present value of the after tax cash flows potentially attributable to it, net of the
return on fair value attributable to tangible and other intangible assets.

Maintenance agreements represent the revenue generated by contracts with customers who pay for
annual maintenance and support. The income approach was used to estimate the fair value of the
maintenance agreements, which includes estimating the ongoing, after-tax income expected from
maintenance agreements in place at the time of each acquisition, including expected renewals.

Patents and core technology represent a combination of processes, patents, and trade secrets
that were used for existing and in-process technology. The value of the trade name and trademarks
is represented by the benefit of owning these intangible assets rather than paying royalties for
their use. Both of these intangible assets were valued using the royalty savings method. This
method estimates the value of these intangible assets by capitalizing the royalties saved because
the Company owns the assets.

Relationships with customers represent the rights granted to the VAR or distributor to resell
certain products. The VAR and distributor relationships were valued using the avoided cost method,
which takes into account the cost of establishing each relationship.

2005 Acquisitions

Pro forma results of operations are not presented for the 2005 acquisitions as the effects of
these acquisitions are not material to Juniper on either an individual or an aggregate annual
basis.



Funk Acquisition:

On December 1, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Funk. Funk,
a leading provider of standards-based network access security solutions, developed products and
technologies that protect the integrity of the network by ensuring both the user and the device
meet an organization’s security policies before granting access. The purchase price for Funk
included a cash payment of $110.2 million. Currently excluded from the aggregate purchase price of
$111.3 million is a balance of $12.2 million held in escrow for indemnity obligations, of which
one-half will expire in January 2007 and the remaining one-half in June 2007. In addition, the
Company may be required to pay certain additional amounts of up to $5.0 million contingent upon
achieving certain agreed-upon conditions over the next 13 months after the close of the
acquisition. Contingent payments associated with future employment conditions will be recorded as
compensation expense when incurred. At the close of the acquisition, the Company recorded a
liability of $0.3 million associated with future lease, severance, and other contractual
obligations, which remained to be paid as of December 31, 2005.

Acorn Acquisition:

On October 20, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Acorn.
Acorn’s products and technologies provide a smooth migration path of more flexible and
cost-effective by connecting legacy Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and other circuit-based
applications across next-generation IP networks. The purchase price for Acorn included a cash
payment of $4.0 million. Currently excluded from the aggregate purchase price of $4.3 million is a
balance of $1.5 million held in escrow for indemnity obligations, which will expire on May 30,
2007. In addition, the Company may be required to pay certain additional amounts of up to $2.2
million contingent upon achieving certain agreed-upon conditions over the next 24 months after the
close of the acquisition. Depending on the contingency, any additional payments will be recorded
as either compensation expense or additional purchase price. Additionally, the Company may be
required to pay an additional amount of up to $1.0 million over a two-year period contingent upon
future services from former Acorn employees. Contingent payments associated with future employment
conditions will be recorded as compensation expense when incurred. Future lease and other
contractual obligations were immaterial at the time of the acquisition.

Peribit Acquisition:

On July 1, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Peribit. The
acquisition enabled the Company to secure and assure the delivery and performance of applications
over an IP network through premium traffic processing. The acquisition of Peribit will further
expand the Company’s customer base and portfolio of products. The acquisition resulted in the
issuance of 11.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of approximately
$256.4 million to the former shareholders of Peribit, of which, approximately 1.6 million shares
with a fair value of $35.2 million, established as of the acquisition date, are being held in
escrow for indemnity obligations prescribed by the merger agreement. This escrow amount is excluded
from the total purchase price of $312.0 million. One-half of the indemnity obligations expire on
the first anniversary of the closing date and the remaining one-half expires 18 months after the
closing date of July 1, 2005. The common stock issued in the acquisition was valued using the
average closing price of the Company’s common stock over a five-day trading period beginning two
days before and ending two days after the date the transaction was announced on April 26, 2005. The
Company also assumed all of the outstanding Peribit stock options with a fair value of
approximately $36.4 million. Such options were valued using Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the volatility assumption of 41%, expected life of 1.8 years, risk-free interest rate of 3.6%, and
a market value of the Company’s common stock of $22.62 per share, which was determined as described
above. At the close of the acquisition, the Company recorded a liability of $3.0 million associated
with future lease, severance, and other contractual obligations through March 2009. As of December
31, 2005, $1.7 million remained to be paid, of which $0.9 million is payable over the next 12
months.

Redline Acquisition:

On May 2, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Redline.
Redline was a pioneer in the development of Application Front End (“AFE”) technology and designed
network solutions that improve the performance, flexibility, and scalability of web-enabled
enterprise data centers and public web sites. The purchase price for Redline included a cash
payment of $97.5 million, a $3.0 million pre-acquisition loan from the Company to Redline which was
forgiven, and assumed stock options with an aggregate fair value of $21.1 million. The stock
options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the inputs of 43% for
volatility, 1.56 years for expected life, 3.5% for risk-free interest rate and a market value of
Juniper Networks common stock of $22.62 per share, which was determined by using the average
closing price of the Company’s common stock over a five-day trading period beginning two days
before and ending two days after the date the transaction was announced on April 26, 2005. The
Company also assumed $1.0 million in net liabilities. Currently excluded from the aggregate
purchase price of $123.1 million is an escrow payment of $13.2 million related to Redline’s
indemnity obligations which will expire on May 2, 2006. At the close of the acquisition, the
Company recorded a liability of $0.8 million associated with future lease and other contractual
obligations, of which $0.5 million remained to be paid as of December 31, 2005.

Kagoor Acquisition:

On May 1, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Kagoor. Kagoor
was a leading provider of session border control products for voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP)
networking. The purchase price for



Kagoor included $58.2 million in cash and assumed stock options with an aggregate fair value
of $7.6 million. The stock options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the inputs of 43% for volatility, 1.58 years for expected life, 3.5% for risk-free interest rate
and a market value of Juniper Networks common stock of $21.64 per share, which was determined by
using the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over a five-day trading period
beginning two days before and ending two days after the date the transaction was announced on March
29, 2005. Currently excluded from the aggregate purchase price of $66.3 million is an escrow
payment of $6.8 million related to Kagoor’s indemnity obligations which will expire on May 1, 2006.
At the close of the acquisition, the Company recorded a liability of $0.4 million associated with
future lease and other contractual obligations, of which $0.1 million remained to be paid as of
December 31, 2005.

In-Process Research & Development:

The Company’s methodology for allocating the purchase price
for purchase acquisitions to in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is determined through
established valuation techniques in the high-technology communications equipment industry. Projects
that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have
no alternative future use. IPR&D is expensed upon acquisition. For the year ended December 31,
2005, total IPR&D expense was $11.0 million in connection with the Funk, Peribit and Kagoor
acquisitions. There was no IPR&D for the Acorn and Redline acquisitions.

For Funk, these efforts pertained to the development of Radius products including Steel-Belted
Radius (“SBR”), SBR High Availability (“HA”), and Mobile IP Module (“MIM”) II products. Funk’s
IPR&D as of the acquisition date also included development of the new versions for Endpoint
Assurance, for Proxy (Remote Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time of the
acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next four
months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.9 million.

For Peribit, these efforts included the development of the next versions of software for the
Sequence Reducer (“SR”) family, Sequence Mirror (“SM”) family, the Central Management System
(“CMS”) products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of
the acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next
twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million.

For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation
products and operating systems. At the time of the acquisition, it was estimated that these
development efforts will be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of
approximately $0.8 million.

As of December 31, 2005, the estimated costs of completing the research and development
efforts relating to the above acquisitions approximated $2.0 million.

Deferred Stock-Based Compensation:

Unvested stock options valued at $13.2 million, $3.8
million, and $2.0 million were issued for the Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor acquisitions,
respectively. The unvested portion of the intrinsic value of the replacement stock options,
established as of the acquisition date, has been allocated to deferred compensation in the purchase
price allocation and are being amortized to expense using the graded-vesting method over the
remaining vesting period.

2004 Acquisition

NetScreen Acquisition:

On April 16, 2004, Juniper Networks completed its acquisition of
NetScreen. The acquisition resulted in the issuance of approximately 132 million shares of the
Company’s common stock with a fair value of approximately $3,651.2 million to the former
stockholders of NetScreen. The common stock issued in the acquisition was valued using the average
closing price of the Company’s common stock over a five-day trading period beginning two days
before and ending two days after the date the transaction was announced. Juniper Networks also
assumed all of the outstanding NetScreen stock options with a fair value of approximately $520.5
million. The options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the inputs of
0.8 for volatility, 3 years for expected life, 2.5% for the risk-free interest rate and a market
value of Juniper Networks common stock of $27.64 per share, which was determined as described
above. The Company also incurred direct costs associated with the acquisition of approximately
$13.4 million. After the initial purchase price allocation, the Company decreased the net tangible
assets acquired and increased goodwill by $6.1 million. The change was due to the recognition of a
pre-acquisition contingency of $12.0 million, partially offset by a number of reductions in the
valuation of certain pre-acquisition accruals. In 2005, the Company paid an additional $6.0
million related to a pre-acquisition contingency and recorded an expense in its results of
operations.



The Company accrued for acquisition charges of $21.3 million primarily related to severance
and facility charges. Ninety-four former NetScreen employees were identified for termination at
the time of the acquisition all related severance has been paid. The remaining restructuring
change consists primarily of facility charges that will be paid through the end of the lease terms,
which extend through 2008. In 2005, the Company reversed $6.9 million of this acquisition accrual
primarily due to re-occupation of the former NetScreen facilities. As of December 31, 2005, $3.0
million remained to be paid, of which $1.5 million is recorded in other long-term liabilities in
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Order backlog represents the value of the standing orders for both products and services. The
order backlog was valued using the avoided cost method, which estimates the avoided selling
expenses due to the fact that NetScreen had firm purchase orders in place at the time of
acquisition. Juniper Networks amortized the fair value of acquired order backlog in 2004 to cost
of revenues.

Of the total purchase price, $27.5 million was allocated to in-process research and
development (“IPR&D”) and was expensed in 2004. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those
that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use.
Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta-phase working prototype in which
there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition, NetScreen had
multiple IPR&D efforts under way for certain current and future product lines. These efforts
included developing and integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips, as well as other
functions and features such as next generation Internet Protocol (“IP”), wireless and digital
subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability. The Company utilized the DCF method to
value the IPR&D, using rates ranging from 20% to 25%, depending on the estimated useful life of the
technology. In applying the DCF method, the value of the acquired technology was estimated by
discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with
which the technology is associated, over the remaining economic life of the technology. To
distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows
attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues, adjustments were made to
provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working capital, and other assets that provide value to
the product lines. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition, it was estimated that these
development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of
approximately $25 million. As of December 31, 2005, there was no remaining costs associated with
these research and development efforts.

Unvested stock options and restricted stock valued at $93.5 million have been allocated to
deferred compensation in the purchase price allocation and are being amortized to expense using the
graded-vesting method over the remaining vesting period. The value represented the unvested
portion of the intrinsic value of the replacement stock options and restricted stock established as
of the acquisition date, Options assumed in conjunction with the acquisition had exercise prices
ranging from $0.09 to $27.11 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $12.48 per share
and a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately 8 years. Juniper Networks
assumed approximately 5.9 million vested options and approximately 20.5 million unvested options
and restricted stock.



The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of
operations of Juniper Networks and NetScreen as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning
of the periods presented. The information in the 2004 unaudited amounts was derived from the
audited statement of operations of Juniper Networks for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the
unaudited statement of operations of NetScreen for the three and a half months ended April 15,
2004. The information in the 2003 unaudited amounts was derived from the audited statements of
operations of Juniper Networks for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the audited statement of
operations of NetScreen for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. Adjustments of $0.6 million
and $86.8 million have been made to the combined results of operations for the years ended December
31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, reflecting the elimination of amortization of purchased
intangibles and deferred stock compensation, charges to cost of goods sold for inventory write-ups
and the valuation of the order backlog, IPR&D and the net tax impact. The unaudited pro forma
financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of
operations of Juniper Networks that would have been reported had the acquisition been completed as
of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated
results of operations of the Company.

million, $56.8 million, and $20.7 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. During 2005, the
Company recorded an impairment charge to operating expense of $5.9 million due to a significant
decrease in forecasted revenues associated with Kagoor’s products.

The net additions to existing goodwill in 2005 was primarily due to the recognition of a
pre-acquisition contingency of $6.0 million related to the NetScreen acquisition. In addition,
pre-acquisition tax adjustments of $0.6 million and $0.5 million were made to the Redline and
Peribit related goodwill amounts, respectively, which increased goodwill. These adjustments were
partially offset by a pre-acquisition tax adjustment of $0.4 million related to NetScreen. Of the
total goodwill acquired in 2005, $47.1 million associated with Funk’s goodwill could be tax
deductible.

The Company performed its annual impairment analysis as of November 1, 2005 and determined
that there was no impairment of existing goodwill at that time. The Company will continue to
evaluate goodwill whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there may be a
potential impairment indicator.

Note 5. Restructuring and Other Operating Charges

The following restructuring charges were based on Juniper Networks’ restructuring plans that
were committed to by management. Any changes to the estimates of executing the approved plans will
be reflected in Juniper Networks’ results of operations.

Restructuring In Connection With The NetScreen Acquisition

In connection with the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, the Company recorded a restructuring
charge of $0.4 million for the termination of 13 employees to eliminate certain duplicative
activities. These employees were from all functions and all geographic theaters and were in
addition to the ninety-four former NetScreen employees that were also terminated. All severance
payments were paid as of December 31, 2004.

Restructuring In Connection With The Discontinuance Of The CMTS Products

In 2003, the Company announced that it would no longer develop its G-series CMTS products and
recorded a charge, to operating expense, of $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce reduction
costs, an asset impairment charge, costs associated with vacating facilities, costs associated with
termination of contracts and other related costs.

All of the workforce reduction severance for seventy-six employees was paid in 2003. The
asset impairment charge was primarily for long-lived assets that were no longer needed as a result
of the Company’s decision to cease further development of the G-series CMTS product line. Facility
charges consisted primarily of the cost of vacating facilities that were dedicated to the
development of the G-series CMTS products and the impairment cost of certain leasehold
improvements. The net present value of the facility charge was calculated using the Company’s
risk-adjusted borrowing rate. Amounts related to the net facility charge are included in other
accrued liabilities and will be paid over the respective lease term through July 2008. The
difference between the actual future rent payments and the net present value will be recorded as
operating expenses when incurred. Other contractual commitments and other charges consisted
primarily of carrying and obsolete material charges from the Company’s contract manufacturers and
suppliers for on-hand and on-order material related to the G-series CMTS products and costs to
satisfy end-of-life commitments in certain customer contracts.

Restructuring In Connection With The Unisphere Acquisition

During 2004, the Company adjusted a restructuring reserve established in 2002 by $0.9 million
primarily for changes in its facilities sublease assumptions and recorded the adjustment as a
credit to Restructuring, Impairments, and Special Charges in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. In 2005, the Company further adjusted this reserve by an immaterial amount due to the
additional facilities sublease income. The Company’s estimated costs to exit these facilities were
based on available commercial rates for potential subleases. As of December 31, 2005, $0.7 million
unpaid balance pertained to leases of consolidated facilities with respective lease terms through
2009.

The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases. The contractual
terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than
the amortized cost of the investment. Given that the Company has the ability and intent to hold
each of these investments until a recovery of the fair values, which may be maturity, the Company
does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2005.

Note 7. Long-Term Debt

In 2003, Juniper Networks received $392.8 million of net proceeds from an offering of $400.0
million aggregate principal amount of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (the
“Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of
payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all
of the Company’s existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the
notes. The Senior Notes are convertible into shares of Juniper Networks common stock, subject to
certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks.
The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes,
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

During 2005, an immaterial amount of the Company’s Senior Notes was converted into common
shares. During 2004 and 2003, the Company paid $145.0 million and $792.0 million, respectively, to
retire its outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2007. These retirements
resulted in a net loss of $4.1 million during 2004 and a net loss of $1.1 million during 2003. The
loss or gain represents the difference between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes at the
time of their retirement, including unamortized debt issuance costs, and the amount paid to
extinguish such Subordinated Notes.

acquisitions, as well as the establishment of a trust in the amount of $25.0 million and deposits
for standby letters of credits for facility leases. Juniper Networks established a trust to secure
its indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers arising from their activities as
such in the event that the Company does not provide or is financially incapable of providing
indemnification. No amounts have been accrued or paid in conjunction with this trust for each of
the three years ended December 31, 2005.

Equity Investments

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying values of the Company’s minority equity

portfolio companies with a cost basis of $1.0 million and wrote down $0.4 million against its
investment in one of the privately held companies.

In addition to the equity investments in privately held companies, the Company held certain
marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale. During 2003, the Company sold
certain of these available-for-sale investments, which had a cost basis of approximately $4.3
million, and recognized a gain of approximately $8.7 million.

Operating Leases

Juniper Networks leases its facilities under operating leases that expire at various times,
the longest of which expires in 2014. Rental expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003, was approximately
$36.4 million, $29.8 million, and $26.5 million, respectively. Future minimum payments under the
noncancellable operating leases totaled $191.6 million as of December 31, 2005. Rent and related
expenses paid to a related party was $4.4 million, $3.3 million, and none for 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively.

Senior Notes

As of December 31, 2005, there was a carrying value of $400.0 million Zero Coupon Convertible
Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (“Senior Notes”) outstanding.

Purchase Commitments

The Company does not have firm purchase commitments with its contract manufacturers. In order
to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers
place non-cancelable, non-returnable (“NCNR”) orders, which were valued at $78.1 million as of
December 31, 2005, based on the Company’s build forecasts. The Company does not take ownership of
the components and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to Juniper
Networks’ agreements with the contract manufacturers. The components are used by the contract
manufacturers to build products based on purchase orders the Company has received from its
customers. The Company does not incur a liability for products built by the contract manufacturers
until they fulfill its customer’s order and the order ships. However, if the components go unused,
the Company may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges. As of December 31, 2005, the
Company had accrued $21.6 million based on our estimate of such charges.



Other Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2005, other contractual obligations consisted of the following:

•

Escrow amount related to Funk acquisition of $12.2 million for indemnity obligations.
One-half of the indemnity obligations will expire in January 2007 and the remaining
one-half will expire in June 2007. Also included is a contingent bonus payable, based
on certain milestones, of $5 million. Bonus will be earned over a period of one year
and recorded as compensation expense.

•

Escrow amount related to Acorn acquisition of $1.5 million for indemnity obligations.
The indemnity obligations will expire in May 2007. Also included is contingent earn-out
payable to stockholders, based on certain milestones, of up to $2.2 million, and bonus
payable to employees related to continued employment of up to $1.0 million. Earn-out
and bonuses will be earned over a period of two years and recorded as additional
purchase consideration or compensation expense, based on the contingencies.

•

Escrow amounts related to Redline and Kagoor acquisitions of $13.2 million and $6.8
million, respectively, for indemnity obligations. The indemnity obligations will expire
in May 2006.

In addition, the 1.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $35.2
million established as of the acquisition date, held in escrow associated with the acquisition of
Peribit for indemnity obligations is not included in the above table. One-half of the indemnity
obligations will expire in July 2006 and the remaining one-half will expire in January 2007.

Guarantees

The Company has entered into agreements with some of its customers that contain
indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that the
Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. Other guarantees or
indemnification arrangements include guarantees of product performance and standby letters of
credits for certain lease facilities. The Company has not recorded a liability related to these
indemnification and guarantee provisions and its guarantees and indemnification arrangements have
not had any significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business, such as employment or intellectual property claims, including the matters described
below. The outcome of any such matters is currently not determinable. Although we do not expect
that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a material adverse result, however, an
adverse result in one or more matters could negatively affect our results in the period in which
they occur.

IPO Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG
Cowen Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase (Hambrecht & Quist
LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc., Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated (collectively, the “Underwriters”), the Company and certain of
the Company’s officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s common
stock in the Company’s initial public offering in June 1999 and its secondary offering in September
1999.

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that the prospectus pursuant to which
shares of common stock were sold in the Company’s initial public offering and its subsequent
secondary offering contained certain false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the
practices of the Underwriters with respect to their allocation of shares of common stock in these
offerings and their receipt of commissions from customers related to such allocations. Various
plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar allegations concerning the initial public offerings
of approximately 300 other issuers. These various cases pending in the Southern District of New
York have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as In re Initial Public Offering Securities
Litigation, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the
action against the Company, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the



Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Defendants in the coordinated proceeding filed motions to
dismiss. In October 2002, the Company’s officers were dismissed from the case without prejudice
pursuant to a stipulation. On February 19, 2003, the court granted in part and denied in part the
motion to dismiss, but declined to dismiss the claims against the Company.

In June 2004, a stipulation for the settlement and release of claims against the issuers,
including the Company, was submitted to the Court for preliminary approval. The terms of the
settlement, if approved, would dismiss and release all claims against participating defendants
(including the Company). In exchange for this dismissal, Directors and Officers insurance carriers
would agree to guarantee a recovery by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants of at least
$1.0 billion, and the issuer defendants would agree to an assignment or surrender to the plaintiffs
of certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters. On August 31, 2005, the
Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to a number of
conditions, including final court approval. If the settlement does not occur, and litigation
continues, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the case
vigorously.

Federal Securities Class Action Suit

During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, a number of essentially identical shareholder class
action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against the Company and certain of its officers and former officers purportedly on
behalf of those stockholders who purchased the Company’s publicly traded securities between April
12, 2001 and June 7, 2001. In April 2002, the court granted the defendants’ motion to consolidate
all of these actions into one; in May 2002, the court appointed the lead plaintiffs and approved
their selection of lead counsel and a consolidated complaint was filed in August 2002. The
plaintiffs allege that the defendants made false and misleading statements, assert claims for
violations of the federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other
relief. In September 2002, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. In March
2003, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed
their amended complaint in April 2003 and the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in
May 2003. In March 2004, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss, without leave to amend,
and entered final judgment against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs appealed. In December 2005, after
complete briefing and oral argument, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed the district court’s dismissal and final judgment.

State Derivative Claim Based on the Federal Securities Class Action Suit

In August 2002, a consolidated amended shareholder derivative complaint purportedly filed on
behalf of the Company, captioned In re Juniper Networks, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Civil Action
No. CV 807146, was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara.
The complaint alleges that certain of the Company’s officers and directors breached their fiduciary
duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct including conduct complained of in
the securities litigation described above. The Company is named solely as a nominal defendant
against whom the plaintiffs seek no recovery. After having their previous complaints dismissed
with leave to amend, Plaintiffs lodged a third amended complaint in August 2004. Defendants
demurred to the third amended complaint. On November 18, 2004, the Court sustained defendants’
demurrer without leave to amend and entered an order of final judgment against plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs appealed to the California Court of Appeal, Sixth District. The appeal has been fully
briefed by the parties. Oral argument has not yet been scheduled.

Toshiba Patent Infringement Litigation

On November 13, 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed suit in the United States District Court in
Delaware against the Company, alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe four Toshiba
patents, and seeking an injunction and unspecified damages. The Company filed an answer to the
complaint in February 2004. Toshiba amended its complaint to add two patents, and the Company
answered the amended complaint in July, 2004. The case is in the discovery phase, and trial is
scheduled for August 2006.

IRS Notices of Proposed Adjustments

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has concluded an audit of the Company’s federal income tax
returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. During 2004, the Company received a Notice of Proposed
Adjustment (NOPA) from the IRS. While the final resolution of the issues raised in the NOPA is
uncertain, the Company does not believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. The



Company is also under routine examination by certain state and non-US tax authorities. The
Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to
these audits.

In conjunction with the IRS income tax audit, certain of the Company’s US payroll tax returns
are currently under examination for fiscal years 1999 — 2001, and the Company received a second
NOPA in the amount of $11.7 million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing
of tax deposits related to employee stock option exercises. The Company responded to this NOPA in
February 2005, and intend to dispute this assessment with the IRS. An initial appeals conference
was held on January 31, 2006. The Company currently does not believe that a liability can be
reasonably estimated at this time. In the event that this issue is resolved unfavorably to Juniper
Networks, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on its results of operations
for the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.

Note 10. Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Option Plans

Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan

The Company’s Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan (the “1996 Plan”) provides for the
granting of incentive stock options to employees and nonstatutory stock options to employees,
directors and consultants. Incentive stock options are granted at an exercise price of not less
than the fair value per share of the common stock on the date of grant. Nonstatutory stock options
may be granted at an exercise price of not less than 85% of the fair value per share on the date of
grant; however, no nonstatutory stock options have been granted for less than fair market value on
the date of grant. Vesting and exercise provisions are determined by the Board of Directors or a
committee of the Board of Directors. Options granted under the 1996 Plan generally become
exercisable over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996
Plan have a maximum term of ten years. Options granted to consultants are in consideration for the
fair value of services previously rendered, are not contingent upon future events and are expensed
in the period of grant. Juniper Networks has authorized 164,623,000 shares of common stock for
issuance under the 1996 Plan. At December 31, 2005, 22,411,922 shares were available for future
option grants or stock sales under the 1996 Plan.

The 1996 Plan also provides for the sale of restricted shares of common stock to employees and
consultants. Shares issued to consultants are for the fair value of services previously rendered
and are not contingent upon future events. Shares sold to employees are made pursuant to restricted
stock purchase agreements containing provisions established by the Board of Directors or a
committee of the Board of Directors. These provisions give Juniper Networks the right to repurchase
the shares at the original sales price upon termination of the employee. This right expires at a
rate determined by the Board of Directors, generally at the rate of 25% after one year and 2.0833%
per month thereafter. At December 31, 2005, zero shares were subject to repurchase rights under
the 1996 Plan and 3,905,000 shares had been repurchased under the 1996 Plan in connection with
employee terminations.

Since its adoption in 1996, the 1996 Plan has permitted the Company to make grants of
restricted stock. In the case of such an award, the entire number of shares subject to a restricted
stock award would be issued at the time of grant. Such shares could be subject to vesting
provisions based on time or other conditions specified by the Board of Directors or an authorized
committee of the Board. The Company would have the right to repurchase unvested shares subject to a
restricted stock award if the grantee’s service to the Company terminated prior to full vesting of
the award. Until repurchased, such unvested shares would be considered outstanding for dividend,
voting and other purposes. No shares of restricted stock were issued under the 1996 Plan in 2005,
2004, and 2003.

On November 3, 2005, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the
“Company”) adopted an amendment to the Juniper Networks, Inc. 1996 Stock Plan (the “Plan”) to add
the ability to issue Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) under the Plan. Unlike restricted stock
awards, RSU represents an obligation of the Company to issue unrestricted shares of common stock to
the grantee only when and to the extent that the vesting criteria of the award are satisfied. As in
the case of restricted stock awards, vesting criteria for RSUs can be based on time or other
conditions specified by the Board or an authorized committee of the Board. However, until vesting
occurs, the grantee is not entitled to any stockholder rights with respect to the unvested shares.
During 2005, the Company issued 4,000 RSUs with an average intrinsic value of $21.9 per share.



2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan

In July 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the Juniper Networks 2000 Non-statutory Stock
Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”). The 2000 Plan provides for the granting of non-statutory stock
options to employees, directors and consultants. Non-statutory stock options may be granted at an
exercise price of not less than 85% of the fair value per share on the date of grant; however, no
non-statutory stock options have been granted for less than fair market value on the date of grant.
Vesting and exercise provisions are determined by the Board of Directors or a committee of the
Board of Directors. Options granted under the 2000 Plan generally become exercisable over a
four-year period beginning on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2000 Plan have a maximum
term of ten years. Options granted to consultants are in consideration for the fair value of
services previously rendered, are not contingent upon future events and are expensed in the period
of grant. As of December 31, 2005, Juniper Networks had authorized 90,901,437 shares of common
stock for issuance under the 2000 Plan. At December 31, 2005, 56,045,740 shares were available for
future option grants under the 2000 Plan.

Plans Assumed Upon Acquisition

In connection with acquisitions, the Company has assumed options under the plans of the
acquired companies, exchanged those options for Juniper Networks options and authorized the
appropriate number of shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to those options. As of
December 31, 2005, there were approximately 15,472,302 shares outstanding under plans assumed
through acquisitions. During 2005, 6,517 shares of restricted common stock have been repurchased at
an average price of $0.33 per share in connection with employee terminations. There were 33,586
shares of restricted shares subject to repurchase as of December 31, 2005.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On December 16, 2005, the Board of Directors amended the Company’s 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) to eliminate the ability of a participant under the ESPP to increase the
rate of his/her payroll deductions during any offering period (as defined in the ESPP). This
change will be effective beginning with the offering period commencing on February 1, 2006.

In April 1999, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of Juniper Networks 1999 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”). The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to acquire
shares of the Company’s common stock through periodic payroll deductions of up to 10% of base
compensation. Each employee may purchase no more than 6,000 shares in any twelve-month period, and
in no event, may an employee purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock, determined at the fair
market value of the shares at the time such option is granted, in one calendar year. The Purchase
Plan is implemented in a series of offering periods, each six months in duration. The price at
which the common stock may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the
Company’s common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period or on the last day of the
respective offering period.

Employees purchased 911,607 shares, 769,000 shares, and 1,475,000 shares of common stock
through the Purchase Plan at an average exercise price of $19.96, $15.39, and $6.74 per share for
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 4,742,700 shares had been
issued under the Purchase Plan at an average price of $8.92 per share, and 7,257,300 shares
remained available for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2004, a total
of 3,831,000 shares had been issued under the Purchase Plan at an average price of $7.95 per share,
and 8,169,000 shares remained available for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has elected to follow APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
employee stock-based compensation plans. Because the exercise price of the Company’s employee
stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation
expense is recognized, other than acquisition-related compensation costs.

The Company has disclosed the pro forma fair value stock-based compensation information
required by SFAS 123 in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The fair value of
each option granted or assumed through December 31, 2005 was estimated on the date of grant or date
of assumption using the minimum value (before the Company went
public) or the Black-Scholes method. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair
value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The
Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected
stock price volatility. The following shows the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the Company’s stock-based
awards:

*The assumptions for 2004 have been revised to include options assumed in the acquisition in 2004. Weighted average assumptions previously reported for 2004 were 54%
for volatility, 3.26% for risk-free interest rate, and 4.6 years for expected life. The revision had no effect on the Company’s previously reported
consolidated results of operations or financial condition as well as
pro forma stock-based compensation expense reported under SFAS 123
for 2004.



In anticipation of adopting SFAS 123R, the Company refined the variables used in the
Black-Scholes model during 2005. As a result, the Company refined its methodology of estimating
the expected term to be more representative of future exercise patterns. The Company also refined
its computation of expected volatility by considering the volatility of publicly traded options to
purchase its common stock and its historical stock volatility. The weighted average estimated fair
value of employee stock options granted during 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $9.63, $12.19, and $8.17
per option, respectively. The weighted average estimated fair value of shares granted under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $6.36, $4.44, and $3.08 per share,
respectively.

On December 16, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of
certain unvested and “out-of-the-money” stock options that had an exercise price per share equal to
or greater than $22.00, all of which were previously granted under the Company’s stock option plans
and that were outstanding on December 16, 2005. Options to purchase approximately 21.2 million
shares of common stock or 49.3% of our total outstanding unvested options on December 16, 2005 were
accelerated. The options accelerated excluded options previously granted to certain employees,
including all of the executive officers and the Board of Directors of Juniper.

In
addition, the acceleration of the unvested and “out-of-the-money” options was accompanied by
restrictions imposed on any shares purchased through the exercise of accelerated options. Those
restrictions will prevent the sale of any such shares prior to the date such shares would have
originally vested had the optionee been employed on such date, whether or not the optionee is
actually an employee at that time.

The purpose of the acceleration was to enable the Company to avoid recognizing compensation
expense associated with these options in future periods in its Consolidated Statements of
Operations pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123R. Under SFAS No.
123R, the Company will apply the expense recognition provisions relating to stock options beginning
in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. In approving the acceleration, the Board considered its impact
on future financial results, stockholder value and employee retention. The Company believes that
the acceleration of the unvested and “out-of-the-money” options was in the best interest of stockholders as the
acceleration will reduce the Company’s reported compensation expense in future periods in light of
these accounting regulations. As a result of the acceleration, the Company expects to reduce the
pre-tax stock option expense it otherwise would have been required to record by approximately $153
million subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R beginning in 2006. The acceleration of the vesting
of these options did not result in a charge to its consolidated statements of operations in 2005.

Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance

At December 31, 2005, Juniper Networks had reserved an aggregate of approximately 190,752,000
shares of common stock for future issuance under all its Stock Option Plans, the 1999 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and for future issuance upon conversion of convertible senior notes.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

During July 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to
$250.0 million of the Company’s common stock. During 2005 and 2004, the Company repurchased and
retired zero and 2.9 million shares, respectively, of its common stock. The average price of 2004
repurchases was $22.17 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $63.6 million. The program may
be discontinued at any time.

Convertible Preferred Stock

There are 10,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock with a par value of $0.00001 per
share authorized for issuance. No preferred stock was issued and outstanding as of December 31,
2005.



Note 11. 401(k) Plan

Juniper Networks maintains a savings and retirement plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Employees meeting the eligibility requirement, as
defined, may contribute up to the statutory limits of the year. Beginning January 1, 2001, the
Company began matching employee contributions. The matching formula was 50% up to 6% of eligible
pay (up to an annual maximum of $2,000). Effective on January 1, 2005, the Company increased the
match from 50% to 100% of eligible pay, up an annual maximum of $2,000. All matching contributions
vest immediately. The Company’s matching contributions to the plan totaled $5.1 million, $3.1
million, and $2.0 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Note 12. Segment Information

An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business
activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses and about which separate financial
information is available. It is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”)
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

In 2005, the Company’s CODM and senior management team (together “management”) began to
allocate resources and assess performance based on financial information by categories of products
and by service. Following the acquisitions of Funk, Acorn, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor, the
Company combined the products from these acquired companies with the Security segment to create the
SLT operating segment. As a result, the Company currently has the following operating segments:
Infrastructure, SLT, and Service. The Infrastructure segment includes products from the E-, M- and
T-series product families as well as the Acorn products. The SLT segment includes Security products
and Application Acceleration products from the Funk, Peribit, Redline, Kagoor, and NetScreen
acquisitions. Security products consist of firewall and virtual private network (“VPN”) systems and
appliances, secure sockets layer VPN appliances, intrusion detection and prevention appliances,
session border control products and the J-series product family. Application Acceleration products
consist of application front end platforms and wide area network (“WAN”) optimization platforms.
The Service segment delivers world-wide services to customers of the Infrastructure and SLT
segments.

Prior to fiscal 2005, management evaluated the Company’s performance by geographic theater and
by categories of products based only on revenues. Management did not assess the performance of its
geographic theaters or categories of products on other measures of income or expenses; therefore,
the Company only had one operating segment.

The re-alignment of operating segments in 2005 was due to a shift in management structure and
responsibilities to measure the business based on product and service profitability. Commencing in
the fourth quarter of 2005, the primary financial measure used by the management in assessing
performance and allocating resources to the segments is management operating income, which includes
certain cost of revenues, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and
general and administrative expenses. Direct costs, such as standard costs, research and
development, and product marketing expenses, are applied directly to each operating segment.
Indirect costs, such as manufacturing overhead, other cost of sales, are allocated based on
standard costs. Indirect operating expenses, such as sales, business development, and general and
administrative expenses are allocated to each operating segment based on factors including
headcounts and revenue. Prior period information has been included for comparative purposes.
Financial information for each operating segment used by management to make financial decisions and
allocate resources is as follows (in millions):

respectively. Two customers individually accounted for 15% and 13% of the Company’s net revenues
in 2003. The revenue attributed to this significant customer was derived from the sale of products
and services in all three operating segments.

The Company attributes sales to geographic theater based on the customer’s ship-to location.

The Company tracks assets by physical location. Over 90% of the Company’s assets,
including property and equipment, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were attributable to its U.S.
operations. The Company does not allocate its assets by segment.



Note 13. Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per
share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that were outstanding during the
period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental common shares subject to
repurchase, common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, and shares issuable upon
conversion of the Subordinated Notes. The following table presents the calculation of basic and
diluted net income per share (in millions, except per share data):

included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the stock
options was greater than the average share price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect
would have been anti-dilutive.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had a valuation allowance on its U.S. domestic deferred
tax assets of approximately $198.6 million, of which approximately $158 million relates to the tax
benefits of stock option deductions that will be credited to equity when realized. The remaining
balance of $40.6 million relates to capital losses that will carry forward to offset future capital
gains. The net valuation allowance decreased by $9.2 million and increased by nil in the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 reduction was attributable to the
recognition of certain U.S. domestic deferred tax assets.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards
of approximately $251 million and $241.9 million, respectively. The Company also had federal and
state tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $77.4 million and $63.8 million, respectively.
Unused net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry-forwards will expire at
various dates beginning in the years 2021 and 2012, respectively.

The Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the
subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. At
December 31, 2005, the Company has unrecognized deferred tax liabilities of approximately $23.8
million related to approximately $66.2 million of cumulative net undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. These earnings are considered indefinitely invested in operations outside of the
U.S., as we intend to utilize these amounts to fund future expansion of our international
operations.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 — Repatriation of Foreign Earnings

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“Jobs Act”), enacted on October 22, 2004, provides for
a temporary 85% dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during either
fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2005. The deduction results in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the
repatriated earnings. During 2005, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors
approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the Jobs Act to repatriate $225.0 million in
foreign earnings in 2005.

The Company repatriated $225.0 million under the Jobs Act in 2005. It recorded a net tax
benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation dividend. The net tax benefit
consists of a federal and state tax provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million, offset by a
tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un-repatriated
earnings.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior quarter balances in order to conform to
the current year’s presentation.

The 2005 quarterly results reflect the impact of the acquisitions of Kagoor and Redline in the
second quarter, Peribit in the third quarter, and Acorn and Funk in the fourth quarter, and the
ongoing effects of these operations for the remainder of the year. The 2004 quarterly results
reflect the impact of the acquisition of NetScreen in the second quarter and the ongoing effects of
its operations for the remainder of the year. Basic and diluted net losses per share are computed
independently for each of the quarters presented, therefore, the sum of the quarters may not be
equal to the full year net loss per share amounts.

Note 16. Subsequent Event

In 2006, the Company repurchased 10,071,100 common shares at an average price of $18.51 as
part of its Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of February 15, 2006, a total of 12,939,700 common
shares had been repurchased since the inception of the program, equating to approximately $250
million at an average price of $19.32 per share.
