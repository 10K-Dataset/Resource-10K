ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

The Company

KLA-Tencor
Corporation (“KLA-Tencor”) is the world’s leading supplier of
process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related
microelectronics industries. Our comprehensive portfolio of products, software,
analysis, services and expertise is designed to help integrated circuit
(“IC”) manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication
process--from research and development to final mass-production yield analysis.

We
offer a broad spectrum of products and services that are used by every major
wafer, IC and photomask manufacturer in the world. These customers turn to us
for inline wafer defect monitoring; reticle and photomask defect inspection;
critical dimension (“CD”) metrology; wafer overlay; film and surface
measurement; and overall yield and fab-wide data analysis. These advanced
products, coupled with our unique yield technology services, allow us to deliver
the complete yield management solutions our customers need to accelerate their
yield learning rates, reduce their yield excursion risks and adopt
industry-leading yield management practices.

KLA-Tencor
was formed in April 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments and Tencor
Instruments, two long-time leaders in the semiconductor equipment industry, each
with over 20 years of experience. KLA Instruments Corporation was incorporated
in Delaware in 1975; Tencor Instruments was incorporated in California in 1976.
Effective April 30, 1997, Tencor Instruments merged into a wholly owned
subsidiary of KLA Instruments Corporation. Immediately following this merger,
KLA Instruments changed its name to KLA-Tencor.

Additional
information about KLA-Tencor is available on our web site at

www.kla-tencor.com

. KLA-Tencor makes available free of charge on its web
site its Annual Report on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, its
Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those Reports filed or furnished
pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

(“SEC”). Information contained on our web site is not part of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC.

Industry

General Background

The
semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer--a round disk
that is six, eight or twelve inches in diameter, about as thick as a credit card
and gray in color. The process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly
sophisticated, involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them
out of a vat of molten silicon. The ingots are then sliced into wafers and
polished to a mirror finish on one surface, upon which the circuits are made.

Page 4

The
fabrication of an IC, or “chip,” is accomplished by depositing upon a
silicon wafer a series of film layers that act as conductors, semiconductors or
insulators. The deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous
other process steps that create circuit patterns, remove portions of the film
layers, and perform other functions such as heat treatment, measurement and
inspection. Most advanced chip designs require over 300 individual steps, many
of which are performed multiple times. Most chips consist of two main
structures: the lower structure, typically consisting of transistors or
capacitors, which perform the “smart” functions of the chip; and the
upper structure, typically consisting of “interconnect” circuitry,
which connects the components in the lower structure.

Current Trends

Companies
that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new
technologies and manufacturing processes, as well as bringing them into
production, are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market. During
past industry cycles, semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with one
key new technology or market trend, such as a specific design rule shrink. In
today’s market, the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in
bringing a multitude of new technologies into production at the same time,
including copper interconnects, new materials, sub-0.10-micron design rules and
300-mm wafers (the next larger wafer size, from which more than twice as many
ICs can be produced as from 200-mm wafers).

While
many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot
production stages, significant challenges and risks associated with each one
have slowed their adoption into full-volume production. For example, as design
rules decrease, yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects,
while device performance characteristics (namely speed or capacity) become more
sensitive to such parameters as line width and film thickness variation. Copper
introduces new physical defects, which are harder to find within the
interconnect structure, as well as electrical defects, which cannot be detected
using conventional optical inspection systems. New process materials like low-k
dielectrics, silicon-on-insulator (“SOI”) and 193-nm photoresists
require extensive characterization before they can be made manufacturable.
Larger 300-mm wafers are more susceptible to damage than 200-mm wafers since
they can bend or bow twice as much, creating stress on the wafer that can result
in yield loss. Film uniformity is also more difficult to maintain on these
larger wafers. Moving several of these advanced technologies into production at
once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face since technical challenges in
bringing any one of these into production could also slow the adoption of the
other technologies.

Our
key activities during fiscal year 2003 involved the development of new process
control and yield management tools that enable chipmakers to accelerate the
adoption of these new technologies into full-volume production, while minimizing
their associated risks. With our portfolio of application-focused technologies
and our dedicated yield technology expertise, we are in a position to be the
single source for comprehensive yield management solutions that enable our
customers to achieve first-to-market success for their next-generation products.

The
continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller linewidth geometries
and more complex multi-level circuitry has significantly increased the cost and
performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these
devices. Construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost
over $3 billion, a substantial increase over the cost of previous-generation
facilities. As a result, chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and
higher returns from their manufacturing equipment. Because our process control
and yield management equipment typically represents only a small, but growing,
percentage of the total investment required to build a fabrication facility, our
customers are better able to leverage these increasingly expensive facilities
and significantly improve their return on investment (“ROI”).

Our Process Control and Yield Acceleration Solutions

Accelerating
the yield ramp and maximizing the production yields of high-performance devices
are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing. Achieving higher yields
faster, along with higher performance characteristics, increases the revenue a
manufacturer can obtain from each semiconductor wafer. Our systems are used to
analyze product and process quality at all critical points in the wafer,
photomask and IC manufacturing process, and provide feedback to our customers so
that fabrication problems can be identified, addressed and eliminated. This
ability to locate the source of defects and other process issues, as well as
contain them, enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing
processes, as well as increase their yields and device value—thus
maximizing their ROI and lowering their manufacturing costs.

The
following are some of the methods used to accelerate yields and optimize device
performance, all of which require the capture and analysis of data gathered
through many measurements:

Engineering
analysis

: This method of analysis is performed offline from the
manufacturing process to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects or
other manufacturing process issues. Engineering analysis equipment operates with
very high sensitivity to enable comprehensive analysis of wafers. Because this
method operates off the manufacturing line, high operational speeds are not
required.

Inline
monitoring

: This method of analysis is used to review the status of ICs
during production. Information generated is used to determine whether the
fabrication process steps are within required tolerances. It is also used to
make any necessary real-time process adjustments before wafer lots move to
subsequent process stations. Because information related to defects is needed
quickly, inline monitoring requires both high throughput and high sensitivity.

Pass/fail
tests

: This method of analysis may be used at several different points in
the manufacturing process to evaluate whether products meet performance
specifications.

The
most significant opportunities for yield and device performance improvement
generally occur when production is started at new factories and technology
shifts in existing factories. Equipment that helps a manufacturer quickly
increase new product yields and optimize device performance enables the
manufacturer to offer these new products in high volumes early in the product
lifecycle—the time when they are likely to generate the greatest profits.

Page 6

We
are a leader in the design, manufacture, marketing and service of process
monitoring and yield management systems for the semiconductor wafer, IC and
photomask industries. Our technical expertise and understanding of customer
needs enable us to provide unique yield management solutions and one of the
broadest lines of process monitoring and yield optimization systems available.
Our systems are used to analyze product and process quality at critical points
during semiconductor manufacturing, as well as provide feedback to our customers
that can be used to identify, address, contain and eliminate fabrication
problems.

Products

We
market and sell products to virtually all major semiconductor, wafer, photomask
and data storage manufacturers worldwide. We combine our
hardware—consisting of patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection, optical
overlay metrology, e-beam review, reticle and photomask inspection,
spectroscopic- and e-beam-based CD metrology, and film and surface measurement
tools—with our advanced yield analysis and defect classification software
to provide fab-wide yield management solutions that are optimized for the
manufacturing process cells used in IC production, including lithography, etch,
deposition and chemical mechanical planarization (“CMP”). Our
offerings can be broadly categorized into five groups: Defect Inspection,
Metrology, Yield Management Software Solutions, Data Storage, and Customer
Service and Support.

Defect Inspection

Our
defect inspection tools are used to detect, count, classify and characterize
particles, pattern defects and electrical failures both inline at various
manufacturing process stages and offline engineering analysis. We pioneered the
market for automated defect inspection of semiconductor wafers and reticles more
than two decades ago. Our portfolio includes all the tools necessary for our
customers to detect, correlate and analyze physical and electrical defects, as
well as determine and correct their cause.

High-Resolution
Imaging Inspection

Our
2xxx wafer inspection series, first introduced in 1992, set the standard for
high-sensitivity patterned wafer inspection through a unique combination of
high-speed image processing, an ultra-broadband brightfield illumination source
and our Segmented Auto Threshold technology. To date, more than one thousand
2xxx systems have been installed at customer facilities worldwide.

In
2000, we unveiled the 2350, an ultraviolet (“UV”) inspection system to
feature ultra-broadband brightfield illumination. Delivering an increase in
throughput over the previous-generation 2xxx platform, the 2350 enabled the
resolution of circuit patterns and defects for 0.13-micron and smaller
processes. In 2001, we introduced an upgrade to the 2350, the 2351, which offers
enhancements in sensitivity, throughput and ease of use. In June 2003, we
introduced our latest-generation high-resolution imaging inspection system, the
2360, which incorporates multiple-bandwidth brightfield illumination and other
enhancements to extend the performance of the 2xxx series to the 90-nm
(0.09-micron) technology node and below.

Page 7

High-Speed Laser
Scattering Inspection

Our
AIT wafer inspection family is designed for providing fast and accurate feedback
on process tool performance, as well as advanced line monitoring for films, CMP,
and non-critical etch and photo modules. The AIT series uses patented
double-darkfield technology, which is a low-angle illumination technique
particularly effective for detecting defects on planar surfaces such as post-CMP
wafers. First introduced in 1995, the AIT platform has been continually enhanced
over the years with increasing levels of sensitivity and throughput to address
the inspection needs for 0.13-micron and smaller design rules.

In
April 2003, we introduced the

AIT

Fusion and

AIT

FusionUV,
our latest-generation darkfield inspection systems. The

AIT

Fusion UV
was developed specifically to address the special inspection and excursion
monitoring needs of sub-100-nm processes on 300-mm wafers. The

AIT

Fusion UV’s unique inline data processing capabilities speed
the resolution of critical yield issues to lower the cost of inspection, thus
accelerating chipmakers’ ramp to volume-production yields.

Electrical
Line Monitoring

Scanning
electron microscopes (“SEMs”) use an electron beam to image and
measure surface features on a semiconductor wafer at a much higher resolution
than images captured by optical microscopes. As the industry drives below the
0.13-micron node, the combination of smaller process windows, new materials and
more complicated process integration at these smaller geometries has given rise
to a new and challenging class of defects. Defects, which are small,
sub-surface, or within high-aspect-ratio structures, can lead to significant
yield and reliability issues in production. In addition, a majority of these new
defects are electrical in nature and cannot be detected by optical inspection
technologies.

Accelerating
yield learning for today’s advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes,
especially in the development and early ramp phases, is made more difficult by
the task of isolating these yield-killing defects from the thousands of
non-relevant defects induced by material anomalies—a time-consuming
process. In addition, due to the extremely tight process margins associated with
today’s advanced IC designs, these electrical defects can recur at random
during volume production. Thus, e-beam inspection is essential—not only
during IC development, where the highest levels of sensitivity are needed to
root out the vast majority of these electrical defects, but also in production,
where dedicated high-speed e-beam inspection systems are required at key process
steps. We pioneered this market with the introduction of the industry’s
first e-beam inspection system more than a decade ago. Since that time, we have
continued to leverage our expertise in e-beam technology to bring new solutions
to market that will enable our customers to identify electrical defect
mechanisms faster, thereby accelerating their yield ramps, time to market and
time to profit on their next-generation chips.

Page 8

Our
µLoop™ methodology, introduced in 2001, provides a fab-wide framework
of solutions that accelerates yield learning for new semiconductor processes in
development through a merger of inspection, metrology and electrical test data.
eD

o

, the first product in the µLoop family, combines non-contact
electrical test with inline physical defect inspection to produce a fast
root-cause analysis method available in the industry today. Using
eD

o

, chipmakers can reduce the length of their yield-learning cycles.

In
May 2003, we introduced the latest addition to our eSxx series, called eS30.
Representing the culmination of more than 25 years of experience in wafer
inspection, the eS30 is an e-beam inspection tool specifically designed for
high-volume production line monitoring of electrical defects. The successor to
our widely adopted eS20XP tool, the eS30 delivers better throughput, sensitivity
and image resolution capability of its predecessor, while allowing users to
classify defects in real time and trend by defect type. The eS30 is targeted to
enable our customers to adopt and proliferate cost-effective electrical defect
monitoring strategies in their high-volume production environments. The eS30
provides the sensitivity needed for advanced process development down to the
65-nm node.

Optical and E-beam
Defect Review

Our
defect review capability includes optical confocal and e-beam scanning
technology. In 1995, we introduced the original CRS™ optical review system,
which enables high-speed defect review and classification on both patterned and
unpatterned 200-mm and 300-mm wafers. In 2000, we introduced the eV300 defect
review system—an advanced, automated SEM designed to gather and analyze
defect excursion information, as well as report the results with the improved
sensitivity required at 0.13-micron and smaller design rules. The eV300
supplements optical review by providing topographical information, enabling more
accurate defect classification than can be achieved by optical review systems
alone.

Unpatterned
Wafer Inspection

In
1997, we introduced the Surfscan SP1™ for bare wafer qualification, process
monitoring and equipment monitoring applications. The SP1

TBI

(Triple
Beam Illumination) was introduced in 1998, and was designed with additional
optical configurations needed to detect sub-micron defects on metal films and
rough surfaces, while still providing sensitivity below 100-nm on polished
silicon. The SP1

TBI

is also used for detecting defects on non-uniform
films, a critical requirement for CMP applications. In 1999, we introduced a
surface nanotopography measurement capability for the SP1 that enhances
lithography and CMP process monitoring for 0.13-micron process development. In
2001, we unveiled the SP1

DLS

, the first 300-mm tool to provide
brightfield, darkfield and nanotopography defect information in a single scan.
It has the sensitivity to capture a wide variety of defects as small as 50-nm at
high throughput speeds.

Page 9

Macro
After-Develop Inspection

In
1999, with the introduction of the 2401 macro defect inspection system we
enabled our customers to automate after-develop inspection (“ADI”) for
macro defects. Designed to replace inefficient manual macro ADI, the 2401 is an
automated inspection system able to detect and classify front-end macro
lithographic defects, which are 50 microns and larger in size. Manual ADI
methods may capture a small fraction of photo-related defects as a result of
wafer complexity, background patterning noise and human fatigue. In contrast,
the 2401 captures most critical macro ADI defects, while providing defect
classification and yield information to reduce scrap and enable continuous
process improvements.

Macro
defects, which can ruin the entire wafer, are costly to chipmakers in 300-mm
production, since more than twice the number of die are at risk with these
larger wafers compared to 200-mm wafers. In 2001, we introduced the 2430 macro
ADI series, which brought the benefits of the 2401 to 300-mm production.

Photo
Cell Monitoring

The
introduction of thinner photoresists, new resist chemistries, tighter process
windows and smaller design rules have all given rise to new and smaller defect
types within the lithography cell—a large area of investment within the
fab. Defect management in the lithography cell is thus critical for qualifying
new lithography processes, and establishing a benchmark for controlling defects
and minimizing yield losses during production. In 2002, we introduced our
µPCM (Micro Photo Cell Monitor) solution to provide fabs with a methodology
for identifying and eliminating lithography-related micro defects before product
lots are placed at risk. Combining our most advanced defect management hardware
and software tools, a new proprietary reticle design, optimized test wafers and
industry-leading expertise, µPCM provides high sensitivity and capture rate
required for reducing lithography-related micro defects. It monitors the health
of the lithography cell and enables chipmakers to make rapid and accurate
“go/no-go” decisions about their product reticles, track systems and
exposure tools.

Backside
Wafer Inspection

In
2002, we unveiled a new Backside Inspection Module (“BSIM”) option for
the Surfscan SP1 series that provides an automated, non-destructive inspection
solution for the backsides of patterned production wafers. Wafer backside
defects can have a significant impact on wafer and process uniformity, both of
which are critical issues in advanced 300-mm processing. Our field trials
indicate that these backside defects can arise at nearly every process step, and
result in yield loss—amounting to millions of dollars annually in lost
revenue. The Surfscan SP1 with BSIM enables automated, non-destructive wafer
backside inspection to be incorporated as a routine step into every process
module, enabling recovery of these yield losses and helping chipmakers further
realize the economic gains in moving to 300-mm.

Page 10

Reticle Inspection

Error-free
reticles are the first step in ensuring high yields in the manufacturing
process, since defects in reticles can be replicated on wafers. Reticles are
high-precision quartz plates that contain microscopic images of electronic
circuits. Placed into steppers or scanners, these reticles are used to transfer
circuit patterns onto wafers to fabricate ICs. The extension of optical
lithography below the 0.13-micron node has resulted in the mask error
enhancement factor, where reticle defects once too small to print on the wafer
become enhanced in the lithography process to create yield-killing wafer
defects. We pioneered the market for automated reticle and photomask inspection
over two decades ago, and continue to be a market leader in addressing our
customers’ evolving inspection requirements.

In
2000, we unveiled our TeraStar™ reticle inspection system for
high-resolution reticle inspection down to the 100-nm node. With its ability to
inspect up to a terapixel (one million by one million pixels) per reticle,
TeraStar provides improvements in throughput compared to previous-generation
systems. Tera™ algorithms enable the inspection of smaller linewidth
geometries and complex resolution enhancement techniques, such as optical
proximity correction (“OPC”) assist features and phase shift masks
(“PSMs”). Its high throughput and sensitivity make TeraStar ideal for
pre- and post-pelliclization inspection in photomask manufacturing operations,
as well as incoming quality control and reticle re-qualification in wafer fabs.

Reticle
CD errors is a major cause of yield loss in IC manufacturing at the 0.13-micron
node. In 2002, we introduced a new option on TeraStar, called TeraFlux™,
which detects minute but relevant CD errors on contact- and via-layer reticles
prior to their first use in the wafer fab. TeraFlux measures the energy that
passes through the contact hole and compares it to another reference—either
die or database—to look for unexpected energy variations. This enables the
TeraStar system to capture reticle CD defects, such as incorrectly sized
contacts or semi-transparencies—both of which will adversely affect the
amount of light passing through the contact holes during the lithography
process. By capturing these critical defects during reticle inspection and
qualification, TeraFlux enables chipmakers to ramp their deep sub-wavelength
lithography processes into production, while minimizing the costs associated
with scrapped wafers.

In
June 2003, we introduced TeraScan™, the successor to TeraStar. A deep
ultraviolet (“DUV”) reticle inspection tool developed for sub-90-nm IC
production, TeraScan offers high sensitivity to detect classical defects
(intrusions, extrusions and point defects) as small as 80-nm, and CD defects as
small as 50-nm. TeraScan has the ability to inspect nearly any type of photomask
used in IC production, regardless of reticle wavelength and resolution
enhancement technology, for sub-90-nm design rules.

Page 11

Metrology

Our
metrology or process window optimization products provide virtually all of the
critical measurements fabs require to manage their advanced manufacturing
processes. With our unique combination of overlay, CD, film thickness and
reflectivity measurements, IC manufacturers have the capabilities to maintain
tight control of their lithography, etch, deposition and CMP processes.

Optical Overlay

Decreasing
linewidths, larger die sizes and increasing numbers of layers in semiconductor
devices all affect the tolerances for layer-to-layer matching, or overlay, and
can result in overlay misregistration errors—a crucial cause of yield loss.
Metrology systems are needed to measure the alignment between different layers
of the semiconductor device to ensure overlay parameters are kept within
specification.

KLA-Tencor’s
overlay metrology systems are more tolerant of process and substrate
reflectivity variations than other optical systems, and provide the measurements
that our customers need to fine-tune their lithography systems to compensate for
these errors and improve process yield. In 2001, we unveiled Archer 10, which
enables overlay measurements to within 2-nm for sub-0.13-micron and 300-mm
production. To augment the performance of the Archer 10, we introduced a new
software tool in 2002 called Archer Analyzer that conducts fully automated,
real-time, on-tool overlay metrology analysis. Seamlessly integrated with the
Archer 10, Archer Analyzer provides information, such as wafer lot
dispositioning and stepper correction data, which helps chipmakers eliminate
unnecessary wafer rework and quickly address variations in the performance of
their lithography tools to minimize yield loss.

In
February 2003, we introduced Archer AIM, our most advanced optical overlay
metrology solution to date. Archer AIM leverages a grating-style target
technology to capture design-rule overlay errors and improve the accuracy of
stepper corrections. Archer targets are denser than traditional box-in-box
targets, resulting in the collection of more process information for improved
correlation to in-device overlay performance. They can also be segmented for
each device layer to meet specific customer requirements. These benefits,
combined with Archer AIM’s precision performance, enable the system to
reduce the total measurement uncertainty associated with traditional overlay
metrology solutions for sub-100-nm design rules.

Focus-Exposure
Line Monitoring

Focus-exposure
control in lithography is a key challenge for CD control at the 0.13-micron node
and below. Unseen lithography focus-exposure excursions can result in CD process
variations that lead to lower yields, cause unnecessary and costly rework, and
reduce scanner productivity. Monitoring focus and exposure variations inline is
thus critical to maintaining tight CD control at these advanced design rules. A
new option on our Archer overlay metrology platform, called MPX, enables
lithographers to control stepper defocus and exposure variations on product
wafers non-destructively. Leveraging dual-tone-design targets and analysis
software, MPX can simultaneously provide separate exposure and focus
measurements on product wafers with a high degree of sensitivity and precision.
This enables MPX to provide fast and accurate feedback on the key parameters
needed to maintain tight CD control in sub-0.13-micron IC production, without
requiring periodic offline monitoring of the exposure tool.

Page 12

Process Window
Monitoring

Over
time, optimal focus and exposure settings for a given lithography cell and
process can drift and change in a variety of ways, such as CD variations during
the patterning process, which result in significant yield losses. Knowing not
just the optimal process settings, but also the size of the process window and
the sensitivity to process variation, is critical for stable and efficient
pattern transfer.

Our
Process Window Monitor™ (“PWM”) series of CD metrology systems
enables chipmakers to monitor and match the process windows of every lithography
cell and process in the fab in real time. Building upon the high precision,
throughput and sensitivity of our CD SEM and optical CD metrology tools, the new
eCD-1-PWM and SpectraCD-PWM series of systems enable a variety of exposure
tool-based diagnostics to be off-loaded to the metrology tools, increasing
production capacity and overall equipment effectiveness of lithography cells. In
addition, enhanced focus-exposure process window information can be provided by
the PWM systems to supplement information obtained by our Archer MPX technology
to enable rapid excursion detection and root-cause analysis.

E-Beam
CD Metrology

Every
nanometer in CD variation in the IC manufacturing process affects device
performance, which consequently impacts yield and bottom-line profitability. At
the 90-nm node, reducing process variation by a single nanometer can improve
microprocessor speed by 10 MHz.

The
eCD 1— unveiled in February 2003—features the precision and resolution
to meet the CD metrology performance requirements for the 90-nm technology node
and beyond. The eCD 1 is based on a new platform, and all its design aspects
have been precision suited for 90-nm node metrology requirements, and extendible
to the 65-nm node. eCD 1 is well

suited

for applications
involving 193-nm lithography and very-high-aspect-ratio structures.

Our
pQC™ (“Pattern Quality Confirmation”) software enables the eCD 1
to provide inline, real-time monitoring of feature shape integrity during the
patterning process—enabling the detection of subtle variations in feature
shape that can occur at and below the 0.13-micron node and go undetected by
traditional CD SEM measurements. Our 8250-R reticle CD control system provides
precise and high-throughput measurements on advanced reticles used in the
production of sub-0.13-micron devices.

Page 13

Spectroscopic
CD Metrology

New
materials that are used in advanced IC production, such as low-k dielectrics and
photoresists for 193-nm lithography, are difficult to control during lithography
and etch processes. As a result, they require taking more comprehensive data on
device features and linewidths to identify and correct process variations and
remain within process windows. Our SpectraCD™ system provides
non-destructive simultaneous and extensive CD, feature-shape and film-thickness
measurements for 193-nm lithography applications and sub-100-nm device
production.

Wafer Geometry
and Nanotopography Metrology

As
device geometries shrink, semiconductor yields become increasingly dependent
upon the flatness and nanotopography of wafer substrates. Even the slightest
variation in topography on the wafer’s surface can impact lithography and
front-end CMP processes, affecting device performance and yields. The growing
adoption of SOI wafers for high-speed, low-power applications is also driving
the need for advanced metrology in SOI wafer manufacturing, since any variation
in topography can ultimately affect device yield.

In
2002, we introduced NanoPro NP1, the industry’s first single-tool solution
for wafer geometry and nanotopography metrology. NanoPro NP1 combines wafer
shape, thickness, flatness and nanotopography metrology in a single scan, and
can monitor SOI and bare wafers inline throughout the wafer fabrication
process—from grinding and etching to rough and final polish. It can be used
to monitor all types of 200-mm and 300-mm wafers, including single-side
polished, double-side polished, epitaxial and SOI wafers, as well as rough,
pre-polished surfaces. With NanoPro NP1, wafer manufacturers obtain more
comprehensive wafer characterization data needed for accelerating process
improvement and development, as well as reducing production time.

Film
Measurement

Our
film measurement products measure a variety of optical and electrical properties
of thin films. These products are used to control a wide range of wafer
fabrication steps, where both within-wafer and wafer-to-wafer process uniformity
are of paramount importance to semiconductor manufacturers—enabling them to
achieve high device performance characteristics at low cost.

In
1995, we introduced the UV-1250SE, which brought a new technology to production,
called spectroscopic ellipsometry (“SE”). Our third-generation SE
thin-film measurement tool, the ASET-F5, addressed the film measurement needs
that came from the continuing evolution of film development driven by shorter
linewidths. In 1999, we introduced an enhanced version of the ASET-F5, known as
the ASET-F5x. It incorporates a single wavelength ellipsometry (“SWE”)
option to complement the industry-leading SE and dual-beam spectrophotometry
(“DBS”) technologies incorporated in the ASET-F5 for even greater
accuracy, repeatability and system-to-system matching.

In
2002, we unveiled SpectraFx 100, our latest-generation thin-film metrology
system, which delivers the precision, matching and stability required for
advanced film-measurement applications for 90-nm device production, including
193-nm lithography processes. Designed to fully support next-generation and
“operator-free” 300-mm fabs with automation and tool-to-tool matching
capabilities, SpectraFx 100 enables foundries and other multi-product
high-volume chip manufacturers to reduce the process development time for
advanced materials and accelerate their adoption into volume production. These
materials include 193-nm photoresists, complex copper dual-damascene film
stacks, and low-k and high-k dielectrics.

Page 14

In
July 2003, we introduced a new option for SpectraFx 100 called AccuFilm, which
eliminates the effects of airborne molecular contamination (“AMC”) on
ultra-thin-film measurements. A key roadblock to achieving control of advanced
gate processes below the 100-nm node, AMC grows rapidly on film surfaces and
degrades the accuracy and repeatability of gate dielectric metrology. AccuFilm
enables SpectraFx 100 to remove these contaminants from product wafers in a
matter of seconds before taking film measurements at each measurement site
without placing product at risk. It is a valuable enhancement for measuring
extremely thin gate dielectric films, which are essential for the production of
high-performance 90-nm and 65-nm devices.

Under  development in fiscal year 2003 and introduced  early in fiscal year 2004,  KLA-Tencor  also offers the MetriX
         100, the industry's first inline,  non-contact metal films metrology system to provide  independent  measurements of both film
         composition  and thickness on product  wafers.  With film  composition  becoming as critical as film  thickness in determining
         the  functionality  and reliability of advanced ICs,  MetriX 100's ability to measure both  parameters  makes it an ideal tool
         for production line monitoring at the 90-nm node and process development for the 65-nm and below nodes.

Contamination
Monitoring

Gate
dielectric quality is critical to the speed and reliability of an IC. Below the
0.13-micron node, dielectrics become so thin (less than 20 angstroms, or the
equivalent of 0.002 micron) that electrical performance characteristics of the
dielectric films become just as critical as physical characteristics in
determining overall transistor performance. Our Quantox™ product line
provides non-contact, inline electrical performance measurements of all the key
parameters that determine the quality of advanced gate dielectric films,
including contamination and oxide thickness, as well as electrical capacitance
and leakage.

In
2002, we introduced the latest addition to this product family, called Quantox
XP. Quantox XP provides information on both the physical and electrical
properties of advanced gate dielectric materials in real time. These materials
include silicon oxynitride (“SiON”) and high-k dielectrics, which are
required for sub-0.13-micron IC production. Quantox XP data provides high
correlation to device electrical test data, enabling chipmakers to predict
transistor performance inline, rather than having to wait until end-of-line
electrical test—a process that normally can take days or weeks to complete.

Page 15

In-situ
CMP End-Point Detection

In
copper deposition, metal film thickness and uniformity can vary significantly
from wafer to wafer. To compensate for these variances during CMP, chipmakers
have traditionally had to either take copper wafers offline, which dramatically
slows the production process, or instead use optical-only

in-situ

metrology methods, which provide limited information and unreliable end-point
data. In 2001, we unveiled Precice™, a production-worthy

in-situ

film thickness and end-point control system for copper CMP that provides
measurements in real time. Precice reduces the risk of process errors due to
non-uniform polishing, thereby speeding the ramp of new copper processes and
maximizing copper yields.

Surface
Metrology

Our
Stylus profilers measure the surface topography of films and etched surfaces,
and are used in basic research and development as well as semiconductor
production and quality control. In 1999, we introduced the
HRP-240

ETCH

, the latest generation of our HRP

®

high
resolution profilers. This system combines the dishing and erosion measurement
capabilities of our long-scan profilers with high-aspect-ratio etched feature
measurement capability, which has historically been limited to atomic force
microscopes. This allows customers to monitor their critical etch processes,
such as shallow trench isolation (“STI”) and dual-damascene
via/trench. We also provide stress measurement systems and capabilities, such as
our new wafer bow and wafer stress option for our ASET-F5x and SpectraFx 100
thin-film metrology tools, which detects reliability-related problems such as
film cracking, voiding and lifting.

Yield Management Software Solutions

Our
productivity and analysis software systems translate raw inspection and
metrology data into patterns that reveal process problems and help semiconductor
manufacturers develop long-term yield improvement strategies.

Yield/Data
Analysis and Management

In
1999, we acquired Taiwan-based ACME Systems, Inc., a provider of yield
correlation software. Combining the newly acquired technology from ACME with our
own yield management expertise led to the development of our Klarity ACE yield
analysis software, which helps our customers quickly identify the source of
defects and process problems, as well as correct them. With our acquisition of
FINLE Technologies in 2000, we developed our Klarity ProDATA lithography data
analysis software, which, along with our PROLITH lithography and etch simulation
software, helps manufacturers reduce their advanced lithography development time
and cost.

Page 16

In
1999, we introduced our IMPACT XP™ automated defect classification
(“ADC”) software, which provides consistent and accurate
classification of yield-limiting defects to help our customers accelerate their
ramp to higher process yields. IMPACT XP incorporates our SmartGallery™
tool, which reduces the setup time associated with ADC implementation in fabs.
This is a critical requirement, particularly for foundries and application
specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) manufacturers, who specialize in
short runs of multiple products. Our Real Time Classification™
(“RTC”) and inline ADC (“iADC”) technologies, which provide
classification and binning of defect types in real time during inspection, are
critical features on all of our latest-generation e-beam and optical inspection
tools.

In
2001, we introduced our recipe management service, called iRecipe™, which
allows factory engineers to quickly and easily access existing recipes and
associated information that reside on a central database from any personal
computer that is connected to the fab intranet. By integrating iRecipe

into their fab network, chipmakers can reduce their inspection and metrology
tool CoO, as well as improve their overall fab efficiency.

Data Storage Industry

Outside
the semiconductor industry, we manufacture, sell and service yield management
solutions to the data storage market.  In the front-end of thin film head
wafer manufacturing, we are the leading provider of the same process control
equipment with which we serve the semiconductor industry, with particular
strength in photolithography control. In the back-end of head manufacturing, we
are the leading provider of a range of test equipment, including fly-height and
head resonance testers, CD-SEMs and high resolution surface profilers.
Additionally, we are leveraging our expertise in magnetics to meet
customers’ needs in the emerging MRAM (magnetic random access memory)
market.

Customer Service and Support

We
enhance the value of our products through our customer service and support
programs, which provide comprehensive worldwide service and support across all
our product lines. We also offer yield technology services to improve our
customers’ ROI.

Global
Support Services

Our
customer support organization is responsible for much of the support of our
customers following the shipment of the equipment and software, including
on-site repair, telephone support, system installation, relocation services and
selected post-sales applications.

As
part of our customer support program, we offer iSupport™, a fast,
comprehensive and secure online capability that enables our technical support
and applications engineers to remotely access data from our tools and operate
them in real time to diagnose and rapidly resolve problems when they occur--all
via a secure online connection controlled by the customer at all times. With the
remote diagnostics capabilities offered by iSupport, customers can achieve such
benefits as improved tool productivity and overall equipment effectiveness, as
well as lower CoO.

Page 17

In
2002, we unveiled our new iPartner™ portfolio of customer support
offerings, which leverages a combination of online and on-site resources to cut
customer service costs, while at the same time boosting tool uptime. Based on
our iSupport technology, the iPartner program takes a tiered approach that
allows customers to scale at any time to the support level that matches their
unique and evolving manufacturing requirements. It is designed to factor in the
change in service and support requirements that occur as process and product
cycles mature. With 7x24 iPartner online support, customers work with our online
engineers to resolve common issues, while reducing the need for on-site
dispatch. This results in reduced service costs for the customer and increased
tool uptime. Even when an on-site visit is needed for complex issues, our online
engineers diagnose the problem and then identify and order the necessary parts
so that the local customer support engineer arrives on-site with the solution
and needed parts in hand to quickly resolve the problem. This approach reduces
mean time to repair, further cutting service costs and increasing tool uptime.

In
one of our most recent initiatives to strengthen our global customer support
infrastructure, we opened Asia-Pacific’s first online support center in
Taiwan in March 2003. Staffed by multilingual technical experts, the Taiwan
Online Support Center utilizes our iSupport technology to help customers
throughout Taiwan, China and the Southeast Asia region better protect their
investment in our tools, while reducing their service costs. In the coming
months, we plan to open more online support centers to help our customers in
other regions to enjoy the immediate benefits of increased coverage and faster
response time, while reducing the need for on-site support.

Our
educational services offer a comprehensive selection of technical
courses—from maintenance and service training to basic and advanced
applications and operation. We offer both standard and customized courses for
individuals and groups, at the user’s location or at any of our three
training facilities. We also offer self-paced learning packages, including
video, computer-based training and study plans.

Yield
Technology Services

Our
Yield Technology Services group provides the systems, software and yield
management expertise to speed the implementation of customers’ yield
improvement programs. This practice provides a broad range of services and
support, including new fab yield management solution planning, factory and field
customer applications training, dedicated ramp management support, integrated
yield management consulting and applications support for effective solution
implementation, and regional customer response centers with remote-access
diagnostics. Use of our consulting practice provides accelerated yield learning
rates and improved device performance for maximum ROI.

Customers

To
support our growing, global customer base, we maintain a significant presence
throughout the United States, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Japan, staffed with local
sales and applications engineers, customer and field service engineers and yield
management consultants. We count among our largest customers leading
semiconductor manufacturers from each of these regions. In fiscal 2003, one
customer (Intel Corporation) accounted for 11% of total revenues. In fiscal 2002
and 2001, no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our revenues.

Our
business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers,
which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for ICs and
products utilizing ICs. We do not consider our business to be seasonal in
nature, but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement
practices of semiconductor manufacturers and is impacted by the investment
patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets. Downturns in the
semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a
material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.

Page 18

Sales, Service
and Marketing

Our
sales, service and marketing efforts are focused on building long-term
relationships with our customers. We focus on providing a single and
comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield
management products and services. Customers benefit from the simplified planning
and coordination, as well as the increased equipment compatibility found when
dealing with a single supplier. Our revenues are derived primarily from product
sales, principally through our direct sales force and, to a lesser extent,
through distributors.

We
believe that the size and location of our field sales, service and applications
engineering, and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in
our served markets. We have direct sales forces in the U.S., Europe,
Asia-Pacific and Japan. We maintain an export compliance program that is
designed to fully meet the requirements of the U.S. Departments of Commerce and
State.

As
of June 30, 2003, we employed over 2,300 sales and related personnel, service
engineers and applications engineers. In addition to sales and service offices
in the U.S., we conduct sales, marketing and services out of wholly-owned
subsidiaries or branches of U.S. subsidiaries in a variety of countries,
including China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia,
Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom. International revenues
accounted for approximately 69%, 67%, and 66% of our revenues in fiscal 2003,
2002, and 2001 respectively. Additional information regarding our revenues from
foreign operations for our last three fiscal years is incorporated by reference
from Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements found under
Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

We
believe that sales outside the U.S. will continue to be a significant percentage
of our revenues. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to
continue to compete successfully in Asia, one of the largest markets for the
sale of yield management services in process monitoring equipment. Our ability
to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading
relationships between countries in the region (especially Taiwan, China, Japan
and South Korea) and the United States, and our continuing ability to maintain
satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region.

International
sales and operations may be adversely affected by imposition of governmental
controls, restrictions on export technology, political instability, trade
restrictions, changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing
and managing international operations. In addition, international sales may be
adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country. The revenues from
our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. Although we attempt to manage the currency risk inherent in
non-dollar sales through “hedging,” there can be no assurance that
such efforts will be adequate. These factors could have a material adverse
effect on our future business and financial results.

Page 19

Backlog

Our
backlog for system shipments and associated warranty totaled $509 million at
June 30, 2003. We include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we
have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within twelve months.
We exclude from backlog orders for non-released products. We expect to fill the
present backlog of orders during fiscal 2004; however, all orders are subject to
cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty. Due to
possible customer changes in delivery schedules and to cancellation of orders,
our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales
for any succeeding period.

Research and
Development

The
market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by
rapid technological development and product innovation. These technical
innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and
appropriate professional staffing. We believe continued and timely development
of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain
our competitive position. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our
human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to
maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs.
As part of our customer relationships, we may enter into certain strategic
development and engineering programs whereby our customers offset certain of our
research and development costs.

Our
key research and development activities during fiscal year 2003 involved
development of process control and yield management equipment especially reticle
inspection and advanced wafer inspection for smaller feature sizes, copper-based
devices and 300-mm wafers. For information regarding our research and
development expenses during the last three fiscal years, including costs offset
by our strategic development and engineering programs, see Item 7
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In
order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry, we are
committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and
new product development. New product introductions may contribute to
fluctuations in operating results, since customers may defer ordering existing
products. If new products have reliability or quality problems, those problems
may result in reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance
of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses. On
occasion, we have experienced reliability and quality problems in connection
with certain product introductions, resulting in some of these consequences.
There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new
hardware and software products, or that new hardware and software products
introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace. If we do not successfully
introduce new products, our results of operations will be affected adversely.

Manufacturing,
Raw Materials and Supplies

We
perform system design, assembly and testing in-house and utilize an outsourcing
strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies. Our in-house
manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components
and subassemblies that are acquired through third-party vendors and integrating
those subassemblies into our finished products. Our principal manufacturing
activities take place in San Jose and Milpitas, California, with additional
operations in San Diego and Hayward, California, and Migdal Ha’Emek,
Israel. As of June 30, 2003, we employed approximately 960 manufacturing and
1,000 engineering personnel.

Page 20

Many
of the parts, components and subassemblies (collectively “parts”) are
standard commercial products, although certain items are made to our
specifications. We use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and
support of our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that
these parts are available from multiple suppliers, this is not always possible;
and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single
supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We endeavor to minimize the risk of
production interruption by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for
key parts, by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers and by
ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain
manufacturing schedules.

Although
we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, in some
cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could disrupt
scheduled deliveries to customers, damage customer relationships and have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Competition

The
worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly
competitive. In each of our product markets, we face competition from
established and potential competitors, some of which may have greater financial,
research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than us, such as
Applied Materials, Inc. and Hitachi Electronics Engineering Co., Ltd. We may
also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and
domestic sources. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design
and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new
products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics. We
believe that to remain competitive, we will require significant financial
resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and
support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and
development.

Significant
competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management
systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, installed base and
technical service and support. We believe that, while price and delivery are
important competitive factors, the customers’ overriding requirement is for
systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate
inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing
processes, thereby enhancing productivity.

Our
process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor industry are
intended to compete based upon performance and technical capabilities. These
systems may compete with less expensive and more labor-intensive manual
inspection devices.

Management
believes that we are well positioned with respect to both our products and
services. However, any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our
prices, customer orders, revenues, gross margins, and market share, any of which
would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.

Acquisitions

We
continue to pursue a course of strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand
our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. In fiscal
2002, we acquired substantially all of the assets of QC Optics, Inc. (“QC
Optics”), a manufacturer of laser-based inspection systems for
semiconductor, flat panel and computer hard disk manufacturing industries.

Page 21

The
financial position and results of operations of this acquisition were immaterial
in relation to those of KLA-Tencor and this transaction was accounted for as a
purchase. Further details of our acquisitions during the last three fiscal years
are included in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
found under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Acquisitions
involve numerous risks, including management issues and costs in connection with
integration of the operations, technologies, and products of the acquired
companies, possible write-downs of impaired assets, and the potential loss of
key employees of the acquired companies. The inability to manage these risks
effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial
condition.

Patents and
Other Proprietary Rights

We
protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual
property laws, including patent, copyright and trade secrets. We have filed and
obtained a number of patents in the United States and abroad and intend to
continue to pursue the legal protection of our technology through intellectual
property laws. In addition, from time to time we acquire license rights under
U.S. and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.

Due
to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management
systems industry, we believe that our protection of patent and other
intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our
technological expertise, continuing development of new systems, market
penetration, installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and
service to customers.

No
assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications
that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents,
licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our
technology. No assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by
us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights
granted hereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that
competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally
competitive technology.

Employees

As
of June 30, 2003, we employed a total of approximately 4,900 persons. None of
our employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work
stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.

Competition
is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor
equipment industry. We believe that our future success will depend in part on
our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management, marketing and
technical employees.

We
also lease office space for other, smaller sales and service offices in several
locations throughout the world. Our operating leases expire at various times
through June 30, 2012 with renewal options at the fair market value for
additional periods up to five years. Additional information of these leases is
incorporated by reference from Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements found under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe our properties are
adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our
production facilities have capacity adequate for our current needs.

ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

We
are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our
business. Litigation, in general, and intellectual property and securities
litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business
operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to
predict. We believe that we have defenses in each of the cases set forth below
and are vigorously contesting each of these matters.

ADE Corporation

On
October 11, 2000, ADE Corporation (“ADE”), a competitor, filed a
patent infringement lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court in Delaware.
ADE claimed damages and sought an injunction under U.S. Patent No. 6,118,525
(“'525 patent”). We filed a counterclaim in the same court alleging
that ADE has infringed four of our patents. We are seeking damages and a
permanent injunction against ADE. In addition, we are seeking a declaration from
the District Court that ADE’s patent is invalid and not infringed by us. On
October 22, 2001, we filed a separate action for declaratory judgment against
ADE in the Northern District of California requesting a declaration that U.S.
Patent No. 6,292,259 (“'259 patent”) is invalid and not infringed.
That action has now been consolidated with the prior action in the Delaware
proceeding, and ADE has amended its complaint in that proceeding to allege that
we are infringing the ‘259 patent. On August 8, 2002, the magistrate
presiding over the action issued a recommendation that the court enter summary
judgment in our favor on the issue of non-infringement under ADE’s
‘525 patent. On the same day, the magistrate issued recommendations that
the court enter summary judgment in favor of ADE on the issue of
non-infringement of two of our patents. The district court judge subsequently
substantially adopted the recommendations of the magistrate regarding claims
construction.

Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd.

On June 27, 2001,
we sued Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd. and TSK America Inc.  ("TSK"),  a competitor,  in the U.S. District Court
in the Northern District of California  alleging that TSK infringes on one of the Company's  patents.
The suit seeks damages and an injunction under U.S. Patent No.  4,805,123  ("`123 patent").  TSK filed a counterclaim
in the same court seeking a declaration that the `123 patent is invalid,  unenforceable and not infringed,
and also alleged  violations of the antitrust and unfair  competition laws.  The  district  court  judge has
entered a ruling  that calls  into  question  the  validity  of the  patent in
suit.  We are examining remedies in connection with that determination.

Although
we cannot predict the outcome of these claims, we do not believe that any of
these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial
position. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur in one or more of the pending
claims, there exists a possibility of a material impact on our operating results
for the period in which the ruling occurred.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the
related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains
forward-looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual
results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking
statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those
discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES

The
preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on
historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure they
remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical
accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a
quarterly basis, and the audit committee has reviewed the Company’s
disclosure relating to them in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our
financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as
follows:

Revenue
Recognition

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, the sale price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred or
services rendered, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We changed our
interpretation of “delivery” based on guidance provided in SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101) effective July 1, 2000. Prior to adoption
of SAB 101, we generally recognized system revenue when title transferred to the
customer (mostly upon shipment). System revenue includes hardware and software
that is incidental to the product. We now generally recognize system revenue
upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and
is operating according to pre-determined specifications. This positive
affirmation is generally evidenced by an acceptance document signed by the
customer. This change has the impact of prolonging the cycle time between order
placement and revenue recognition. In limited cases, we allow for exceptions
where we recognize system revenue upon shipment if acceptance is not required;
however, these exceptions have accounted for approximately 3.1% and 2.5% of our
revenue for the fiscal years ended 2003 and 2002. Shipping charges billed to
customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are
included in cost of sales. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements under “Revenue Recognition” for detailed description of
exceptions.)

Page 28

Revenue
from software license fees is typically recognized upon shipment if collection
of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and
vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee
to any undelivered elements of the arrangement. Such undelivered elements in
these arrangements typically consist of services and/or upgrades. If
vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements
of the arrangement, all revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist, or
until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. In instances where an
arrangement to deliver software requires significant modification or
customization, license fees are recognized under the percentage of completion
method of contract accounting. Allowances are established for potential product
returns and credit losses. To date, revenue from license fees have been less
than 10% of total revenue.

Spare
parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has
passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.

Service
and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance
contract. If maintenance is included in an arrangement, which includes a
software license agreement, amounts related to maintenance are allocated based
on vendor specific objective evidence. Consulting and training revenue is
recognized when the related services are performed.

The
deferred system profit balance as of June 30, 2003 was $177 million. This amount
equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on
shipment and deferred under SAB 101 less applicable product and warranty costs.
The deferred profit balance decreased from $194 million at June 30, 2002
primarily because shipments were lower than customer acceptance for which
revenue was recognized during fiscal 2003.

We
also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales
as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the
standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is
recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period
commences. The unearned revenue balance decreased to $48 million at June 30,
2003 from $55 million at June 30, 2002 primarily due to the increase in service
revenue recognized from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003.

Inventory
Reserves

We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly
basis. For production inventory, our methodology involves matching our on-hand
and on-order inventory with our build forecast over the next twelve months. We
then evaluate the parts found to be in excess of the twelve-month demand and
take appropriate reserves to reflect the risk of obsolescence. For spare parts
inventory, we match our on-hand inventory against twenty-four months of usage.
We then evaluate the parts in excess of the twenty-four month usage and take
appropriate reserves to reflect risk of obsolescence. Both methodologies are
significantly affected by the usage assumption. The longer the time period of
estimated usage, the lower the reserves are required. Based on our past
experience, we believe the twelve-month/twenty-four month time periods best
reflect the reasonable and relative obsolescence risks. If actual demand or
usage were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional inventory
adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Inventory reserves, once established, are not reversed until the
related inventory has been sold.

Page 29

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

A majority of our trade receivables are derived from
sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world.
In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for
doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses based upon our
assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The
allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically to assess the adequacy
of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we
are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and
(2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their
impact on our customers. If circumstances change, and the financial condition of
our customers were adversely affected resulting in their inability to meet their
financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which
would result in a reduction of our net income.

Warranty

We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for twelve months,
providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty
period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to cost of sales
when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical
product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we
calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the
labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update
these estimated charges every quarter. The actual product performance and/or
field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty
reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty
costs tends to be larger for new product introductions for which there is
limited or no historical product performance on which to base the estimated
warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories
tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non-standard warranty
generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week
coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is deferred as unearned
revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term
period commences.

Contingencies
and Litigation

We are currently named as a party to various legal
proceedings, including those outlined in Part I, Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we currently
believe the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, both individually and in the
aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but
may adversely affect our quarterly operating results, the results of complex
legal proceedings are difficult to predict. We would accrue the cost of an
adverse judgment if, in our estimation, the adverse settlement is probable and
we can reasonably estimate the ultimate cost to us. We have made no such
accruals as of June 30, 2003.

Income
Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires that deferred tax assets
and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of
temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and
liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a
valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred
tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable
income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However,
should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we
could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax
assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in
which we determined that the recovery was not probable.

Page 30

On
a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an annual effective
income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region,
availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning
strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our
effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these
estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and
results of operations.

Results of
Operations

During
fiscal 2003 we continued to face a significant downturn in the semiconductor
industry, which started in early calendar year 2001. In calendar year 2001, the
demand for semiconductors dropped by approximately 32% and remained flat to
slightly higher in calendar year 2002. Although new orders grew, quarter on
quarter by approximately $21 million in the three months ended June 30, 2003, we
are still cautious about the timing of a broad based turnaround in the growth of
demand for semiconductors looking forward. Electronics industry analysts
forecast semiconductor shipments for calendar year 2003 to grow over calendar
year 2002.

Over
the longer term, we expect process control to continue to represent a higher
percentage of our customers’ capital spending. We believe this increase in
process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise
diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further
shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to copper and other new
materials, and the transition to new 300-millimeter fabs. We anticipate these
factors will drive increased demand for our products and services when the
semiconductor industry recovers.

New
system and service orders by region were as follows (in millions):

Page 31

KLA-Tencor’s
backlog for unshipped system orders as of June 30, 2003 was approximately $509
million, a majority of which we expect to ship over the next six to nine months.
In addition, we have $351 million of SAB 101 deferred revenue that is related to
products that have been delivered but are awaiting written acceptance from the
customer.

Revenues and
Gross Margin

Product
revenue in fiscal 2003 decreased $368 million, or 26% to $1.06 billion, from
$1.43 billion in fiscal 2002. Product revenue decreased $479 million, or 25%, to
$1.43 billion in fiscal 2002 from $1.91 billion in fiscal 2001. Product revenue
declines were primarily from reduced capital spending by our customers as a
result of a significant reduction in the demand for semiconductors over the last
two years. In fiscal 2003, international product revenue increased slightly to
71% of revenue, from 69% in fiscal 2002, due to higher demand in Taiwan. In
fiscal 2002, international product revenue increased slightly to 69% of revenue,
from 67% in the prior year, due to higher demand in Japan and Western Europe,
partially offset by lower demand in Taiwan.

Service
revenue is generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and
material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of
the warranty period. Service revenues were $263 million, $209 million, and $196
million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively. Service revenue continued to
increase throughout the 3-year-period as our installed base of equipment at our
customers’ sites continued to grow. The amount of service revenue generated
is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our
customers’ sites and the degree of utilization of those systems.

Gross
margins as a percentage of revenues were 49%, 50% and 55% in fiscal 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 and
fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 were primarily due to reduced capacity
utilization, resulting from lower business volume and an increased percentage of
revenue in the lower margin service business. Although gross margins fell below
the 50% level in fiscal 2003, we have implemented plans for continued expense
reductions aimed at bringing margins back above the 50% range even if industry
conditions remain weak. Our plans for expense reduction include streamlining
manufacturing costs through the use of common platforms, leveraging
manufacturing procurement through consolidation of vendors and further expanding
on outsourcing initiatives.

Engineering,
Research and Development

Net
engineering, research and development expenses were $268 million, $287 million,
and $356 million, or 20%, 18% and 17% of revenues in fiscal 2003, 2002, and
2001, respectively. The absolute dollars decreased in fiscal 2003, compared to
fiscal 2002, due to engineering programs reaching certain milestones that
resulted in reductions in labor and material expense, additional external
funding and cost saving measures such as company mandated time-off and reduction
in discretionary spending implemented over the last several quarters in response
to the industry slow down. The dollars decreased in fiscal 2002, compared to
fiscal 2001, primarily due to temporary shutdowns, management pay cuts,
reductions in temporary labor and discretionary spending as well as other cost
saving measures implemented over the last year. We expect our net engineering,
research and development expenses to be flat to slightly up in absolute dollars
as we make investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and
existing product enhancements.

Page 32

Net
engineering, research and development expenses were partially offset by $18
million, $14 million and $8 million in external funding received under certain
strategic development programs conducted with several of our customers and
government grants in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Our
future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce
products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our
marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial
investments in our research and development efforts. We remain committed to
product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the further
shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to copper and other new
materials, and the transition to new 300-millimeter fabs. Our investments in new
technology and existing product enhancements are intended to enable our
customers to achieve a higher return on their capital investments and higher
productivity through cost-effective, leading edge technology solutions.

Selling,
General and Administrative

Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $254 million, $291 million and $354
million, or 19%, 18% and 17% of revenues, in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively. The absolute dollars for selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased primarily due to company mandated time-off, reductions in
labor and discretionary spending as well as other cost saving measures
implemented over the last several quarters in response to the industry slowdown
and the ongoing global economic weakness. We expect our selling, general and
administrative expenses to be flat to slightly down in absolute dollars as we
continue to realize the benefits from these cost saving measures.

Non-Recurring
Acquisition, Restructuring and Other Charges

The
following is a summary of non-recurring acquisition, restructuring and other
charges for the three fiscal years ending June 30:

Page 33

Restructuring and Other
Charges

In
fiscal 2003, we structured
 certain of our operations to realign costs with planned business levels in light of
 the industry downturn. We classified restructuring
costs into two main categories: facilities and other charges of $4.6 million and
severance and benefits of $1.1 million. As part of the facilities consolidation,
we exited several of our leased buildings and have included the remaining net
book value of the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease
payments, net of anticipated sublease revenue, in the charge. Severance and
benefit charges were related to the involuntary termination of approximately 70
personnel from manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and administration
in the United States, Japan and Europe. The restructuring actions taken in
fiscal 2003 are proceeding as planned, with the termination of employees having
been completed and the facilities related lease payments scheduled to be
completed by the end of fiscal 2004. In addition, during the first fiscal
quarter of 2003, we received $15.2 million as a second and final installment on
the sale of software and intellectual property associated with our

iSupport

™ on-line customer support technology, which was netted
against the above non-recurring charges, resulting in a reported net gain of
$9.4 million

In
addition to the restructuring action, we also recorded severance charges
totaling $10.9 million in operating expenses, throughout fiscal 2003, relating
to a series of employee involuntary terminations. We believe that both these
actions will result in annual reductions in costs of goods sold and operating
expenses of approximately $60 million.

In
fiscal 2002, there were no restructuring charges. We recorded severance charges
of $8.5 million in operating expenses relating to a series of employee involuntary
terminations throughout fiscal 2002. This resulted in annual cost
reductions in costs of goods sold and operating expenses of approximately $44
million. In fiscal 2001, in response to the downturn in the semiconductor
industry, we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce spending. Charges
related to the restructuring plan included: facilities of $4.7 million,
severance and benefits of $1.6 million, and other costs of $1.0 million.
Facilities related charges were associated with two of our leased office
buildings that were vacated and included the remaining net book value of the
related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease payments, net of
anticipated sublease revenue in the charge. During fiscal 2001, we reduced our
workforce by approximately 5%, primarily in the manufacturing areas and recorded
severance charges related to these terminations. The restructuring actions taken
in fiscal 2001 were substantially completed at the end of fiscal 2002. These
restructuring actions resulted in annual reductions in cost of goods sold and
operation expenses of approximately $18 million. In addition, during the fourth
fiscal quarter of 2001, we sold software and intellectual property associated
with its

iSupport

™ on-line customer support technology and recorded
$10.0 million pretax, non-recurring income, which was netted with the other
non-recurring charges.

The
following table shows the details of the facilities, severance and other
restructuring costs accrual for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003:

Page 34

The
semiconductor equipment industry that we operate in is a highly cyclical
industry. This cyclical nature affects our ability to accurately predict future
revenue and, thus, future expense levels. We are currently in a down cycle, and
if this current down cycle continues to linger or worsens, we may need to take
appropriate actions to scale down operating expenses to even lower business
levels.

Acquisitions

During fiscal years 2002
and 2001, we completed certain purchase acquisitions. The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the operating results of each business from the date of
acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the
effects of these acquisitions were not material on either an individual or
aggregate basis. For a period of up to twelve months from the acquisition date,
we may change the original purchase price allocation for pre-acquisition
uncertainties. After twelve months, we record the fair value of such reasonably
estimable contingencies.

The
amounts allocated to in-process research and development (“in-process
R&D”) were determined through established valuation techniques in the
high-technology equipment industry and were expensed upon acquisition because
technology feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses
existed. Amounts allocated to goodwill and purchased intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding five years.

A
summary of purchase transactions is outlined as follows (in thousands):

Interest
Income and Other, Net

Interest
income and other, net was $42 million, $43 million and $54 million in fiscal
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Interest income and other, net is comprised
primarily of interest income earned on the investment and cash portfolio, gains
realized on sales of marketable securities and income recognized upon settlement
of certain foreign currency contracts. The decrease in fiscal 2003 as compared
to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to decreased interest income resulting from
declining interest rates and an increase in foreign currency losses resulting
from increased volatility in foreign exchange markets partially offset by an
increase in realized gains on investments resulting from investment decisions
which impacted the timing of realizing gains and losses for these investments.
The decrease in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to
decreased interest income resulting from declining interest rates.

effective income tax rate was 24%, 25% and 27% in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. In general, our effective income tax rate differs from the
statutory rate of 35% largely as a function of benefits realized from our
Extraterritorial Income (“ETI”) exclusion, research and development
tax credits and income derived from tax exempt interest.

The
overall reduction in our effective income tax rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal
2003 of 1% is primarily the result of more R&D credit, more tax-exempt
interest and less nondeductible losses relative to these same items as a
percentage of pre-tax income in the prior fiscal year. These reductions were
partially offset by more relative foreign tax expense. The overall reduction in
our effective income tax rate from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 of 2%, was the
result of a combination of factors, most important of which, were more export
sales benefits, more tax-exempt interest income and less state tax expense
relative to these same items as a percentage of pre-tax income in fiscal 2001.
These reductions were partially offset by more relative foreign tax expense.

Our
future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax
legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, non tax
deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, amounts of
tax-exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage
of aggregate pre-tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning
strategies. There currently is pending legislation to repeal the existing export
incentive provided by the United States Internal Revenue Code. If the
legislation were enacted it would likely increase our effective rate in future
periods.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Working
capital was $1.16 billion as of June 30, 2003, compared to $932 million as of
June 30, 2002. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities at
June 30, 2003 increased to $957 million from $673 million at June 30, 2002. In
addition, we maintained $531 million and $660 million in marketable securities
classified as long-term as of June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

KLA-Tencor
has historically financed its operations through cash generated from operations.
Cash provided by operating activities was $246 million, $270 million, and $408
million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in cash
provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was
primarily due to a decline in net income, increase in gains from sale of
investments and other long-term assets partially offset by lower accounts
receivable and inventory balances. Net income decreased in fiscal 2003 compared
to fiscal 2002 primarily due to declining shipments, revenues and gross margins
partially offset by decreased engineering, selling, general and administrative
expenses associated with cost saving measures in response to the industry
slowdown. Gains from the sale of investments increased due to investment
decision regarding the timing of realizing gains and losses on these
investments. Accounts receivable declined primarily due to strong collection
efforts, as well as lower shipments. The reduction in inventory primarily
occurred in production inventory, where stringent processes have been put in
place for managing material procurement. The decrease in cash provided by
operating activities in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to
decreased income before the cumulative effect of accounting change and lower
accounts payable, partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory
balances. Income before cumulative effect of accounting change decreased in
fiscal 2002, compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to declining shipments,
revenues and gross margins partially offset by decreased engineering, selling,
general and administrative expenses associated with cost saving measures in
response to the industry slowdown. Accounts payable shrank due to decreased
expenditures and lower incoming invoices. Accounts receivable declined primarily
due to strong collection efforts, as well as lower shipments. The reduction in
inventory was driven primarily in production inventory, where stringent
processes have been put in place for managing material procurement.

We have
agreements with two
Japanese institutions to sell without recourse certain of our trade receivables
and promissory notes. During fiscal 2003 we sold $99 million and during 2002 we
sold $98 million of trade notes and accounts receivable from Japanese customers,
under these arrangements. At June 30, 2003 and 2002, $27 million and $48
million, respectively, of these receivables and notes were outstanding, which
have not been included in our consolidated balance sheet as the criteria for
sale treatment established by SFAS 140 have been met. Under SFAS 140, after a
transfer of financial assets, an entity derecognizes financial assets when
control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
The total amount available under the facilities is the Japanese yen equivalent
of $92 million based upon exchange rates as of June 30, 2003. We do not
believe we are materially at risk for any losses as a result of these
agreements.

Page 37

Cash
used in investing activities was $99 million, $362 million and $295 million in
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Investing activities typically consist
of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of
capital assets to support long-term growth and acquisitions of technology or
other companies to allow access to new market segments or emerging technologies.
Additions of capital assets during fiscal 2003 consisted mainly of the purchase
of certain of our leased buildings in November 2002 compared to fiscal 2002
additions that consisted mainly of the planned completion of our Livermore
facilities.

We generated
$27 million of
cash from financing activities in fiscal 2003 compared with $9 million and $58
million of cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of
our common stock, as well as borrowings and repayments of debt. Issuance of
common stock, net of repurchases, provided $27 million in fiscal 2003.
Repurchases of common stock, net of issuance, used $8 million and $60 million in
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, respectively.

We
have adopted a plan for the systematic repurchase of shares of our common stock
in the open market to reduce the dilution created by our stock-based employee
benefit and incentive plans. Since the inception of the repurchase program in
1997 through June 30, 2003 our Board of Directors has authorized KLA-Tencor to
repurchase a total of 17.8 million shares, including 5 million shares authorized
in October 2002. In fiscal 2003, we repurchased 1,972,000 shares of our common
stock at an average price of $33.42 per share, for a total of $66 million. In
fiscal 2002, we repurchased 3,341,000 shares of our common stock at an average
price of $36.89 per share, for a total of $123 million. In fiscal 2001, we
repurchased 4,580,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $33.54
per share, for a total of $154 million. Since the inception of the repurchase
program in 1997 through June 30, 2003, we have repurchased a total of 13,321,000
shares at an average price of $32.70 per share, with an additional 4.5 million
shares available for repurchase under the plan. All repurchased shares remain as
treasury shares.

Certain
of our leased facilities qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under
SFAS 13, “Accounting for Leases,” and, as such, the facilities are not
included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lease agreement for certain
Milpitas and San Jose, California facilities had a term of five years ending in
November 2002, with an option to extend up to two more years. Under the terms of
the lease, we, at our option, could acquire the properties at their original
cost or arrange for the properties to be acquired. In November 2002, we
purchased these facilities at the end of the lease term. The purchase
transaction increased land and property by approximately $120 million and
decreased cash by the same amount.

At
June 30, 2003, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.49 billion of
cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Our liquidity is affected by many
factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the
business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies
and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash
requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, our
management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the
liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our
liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.

Page 38

The
following is a schedule summarizing our significant operating lease commitments
as of June 30, 2003 (in millions):

Additionally,
we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to
ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability in
these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon
as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time-horizon can vary
amongst different suppliers. As such, it is difficult to accurately report our
true open commitments at any particular point in time. However, we estimate our
open inventory purchase commitment as of June 30, 2003 to be no more than $42
million.

FACTORS
AFFECTING RESULTS, INCLUDING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Fluctuations in Operating Results
and Stock Price

Our
operating results have varied widely in the past, and our future operating
results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon numerous
factors, including those listed in this section and throughout this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. In addition, future operating results may not follow any
past trends. We believe the factors that could make our results fluctuate and
difficult to predict include:

o   global economic
uncertainty;

o   the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry;

o   changing international economic conditions;

o   competitive pressure;

o   our ability to develop and implement new technologies
and introduce new products;

o   our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements;

o   our ability to protect our intellectual property;

o   our ability to attract, retain, and replace key employees;

o   worldwide political instability; and

o   earthquake and other uninsured
risks.

Operating
results also could be affected by sudden changes in customer requirements,
currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions affecting
customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets
in which we do business. As a result of these or other factors, we could fail to
achieve our expectations as to future revenue, gross profit and income from
operations. Our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published
by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price
of our stock, particularly on a short-term basis, and could negatively affect
the value of any investment in our stock.

Page 39

Global Economic Uncertainty

Our
business is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by
consumers and businesses. This end-user demand has been significantly depressed
over the last few quarters and there has been very limited visibility as to the
timing of turnaround in demand growth and from which sector this growth will
come. A protracted global economic slowdown will continue to exacerbate this
issue and may adversely affect our business and results of operation.

Semiconductor Equipment Industry Volatility

The
semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical. The purchasing decisions of
our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in
which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide. The timing,
length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment
industry are difficult to predict. This cyclical nature of the industry in which
we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus,
future expense levels. When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected
revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction
measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially
sound. During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and
expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate
and retain our key employees. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we
must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer
demand. We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely
manner in response to industry cycles. If we fail to respond to industry cycles,
our business could be seriously harmed.

We
are currently in an industry down cycle. We are not able to predict when the
semiconductor industry will recover. During a down cycle, the semiconductor
industry typically experiences excess production capacity that causes
semiconductor manufacturers to decrease capital spending. We generally do not
have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not
control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers. Whether and to
what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, as well as the
mix and quantities of products included in those orders, are factors beyond our
control. Insufficient orders, especially in our down cycles, will result in
under-utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure and will
negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.

International Trade and Economic Conditions

We
serve an increasingly global market. A majority of our annual revenue is derived
from outside the United States, and we expect that international revenue will
continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue. Our international
revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each
country and region. Because of our significant dependence on international
revenue, a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which
we do business could negatively affect our operating results.

Page 40

Managing
global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges
associated with, among other things, cultural diversity and organizational
alignment. Moreover, each region in the global semiconductor equipment market
exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment
patterns to vary significantly from period to period. Periodic local or
international economic downturns, trade balance issues, political instability in
regions where we have operations, such as Israel, and fluctuations in interest
and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of
operations. Although we attempt to manage near-term currency risks through the
use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be
adequate. In addition, our ability to address normal business transaction issues
in Asia is at risk due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in
Asia, which has resulted in management’s decision to limit travel to Asia
in accordance with the World Health Organization’s recommendations.

Competition

Our
industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support
customers worldwide. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability
to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are
diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive
research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support
capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose
strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services, some of which
compete with the products and service that we offer. These competitors may
bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing
our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging
semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the
products and services, which we offer, using innovative technology to sell
products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could negatively
affect our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin, and market share, any
of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.
Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously
harm our business.

Technological Change and Customer Requirements

Success
in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual
improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions. For
example, the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of
semiconductor devices, transition to copper and other new materials, and
transition to new 300-millimeter fabs. While we expect these trends will
increase our customers’ reliance on our diagnostic products, we cannot
ensure that they will directly improve our business. These and other evolving
customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to
cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide
support. Technical innovations are inherently complex and require long
development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our competitive
advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately
predict evolving industry standards, to develop and introduce new products which
successfully address changing customer needs, to win market acceptance of these
new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and
cost-effective manner. If we do not develop and introduce new products and
technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or
customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed.

Page 41

In
this environment, we must continue to make significant investments in research
and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our
products, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands
for improved performance, features and functionality. There can be no assurance
that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to
recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements or
that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future
development. Substantial research and development costs typically are incurred
before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a
product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable
products. In addition, we cannot ensure that these products or enhancements will
receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at
prices that are favorable to us. Our business will be seriously harmed if we are
unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we
operate does not accept our products.

Key Suppliers

We
use a wide range of materials in the production of our products, including
custom electronic and mechanical components, and we use numerous suppliers to
supply these materials. We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements
with our suppliers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’
orders, we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for
manufacturing. We seek to minimize the risk of production and service
interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying
alternative suppliers for key parts, monitoring the financial stability of key
suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. Although we make
reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers,
key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of
suppliers. Our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to
meet our production requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Manufacturing Disruption

Most
of our manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, with a small
operation located in Israel. Operations at our manufacturing facilities and our
assembly subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons,
including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, energy
shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. Such disruption could cause
delays in shipments of products to our customers. We cannot ensure that
alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to
occur or that, if it were available, it could be obtained on favorable terms.
Such disruption could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and
could seriously harm our business.

Page 42

Intellectual Property
Obsolescence and Infringement

Our
success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. We
own various United States and international patents and have additional pending
patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. The
process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be
certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued
patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to
provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. Other companies and
individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies and
obtain patents relating to our technology that are similar or superior to our
technology or may design around the patents we own, adversely affecting our
business.

We
also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim
copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation.
However, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be
upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.

While
patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is
important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most
dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel. We
attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through
confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees
and consultants and through other security measures. We also maintain exclusive
and non-exclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in
certain products. However, these employees, consultants and third parties may
breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. In
addition, the laws of certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or
sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same
extent as do the laws of the United States.

As
is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry, from time to time we have
received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent
rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which
they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or
information. Our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to
consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate. However, we cannot ensure
that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or
that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. The
inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could
seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.

Key Employees

Our
employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and
other employees are difficult to replace. We generally do not have employment
contracts with our key employees. Further, we do not maintain key person life
insurance on any of our employees. The expansion of high technology companies
worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel. If we
are unable to retain key personnel, or if we are not able to attract, assimilate
or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future,
our business and operations could be harmed. These factors could seriously harm
our business.

Page 43

Acquisitions

In
addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources, we
also seek to acquire new technologies from external sources. As part of this
effort, we may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses
with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Acquisitions involve
numerous risks, including management issues and costs in connection with the
integration of the operations and personnel, technologies and products of the
acquired companies, the possible write-downs of impaired assets, and the
potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. The inability to
manage these risks effectively could seriously harm our business.

Litigation

From
time to time we are involved in litigation of various types, including
litigation that alleges infringement of intellectual property rights and other
claims. Litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management
time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations
or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms.
If we lose in a dispute concerning intellectual property, a court could require
us to pay substantial damages and/or royalties or could issue an injunction
prohibiting us from using essential technologies. For these and other reasons,
this type of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Also, although we may seek to
obtain a license under a third party’s intellectual property rights in
order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us, we may
not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all.

Terrorism and Political Instability

The
threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do
business, including the United States, increases the uncertainty in our markets
and may delay any recovery in the general economy. Any delay in the recovery of
the economy and the semiconductor industry could seriously impact our business.

Increased
international political instability, as demonstrated by the September 2001
terrorist attacks, disruption in air transportation and further enhanced
security measures as a result of the terrorist attacks, and the continuing
instability in the Middle East, may hinder our ability to do business and may
increase our costs of operations. Such continuing instability could cause us to
incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable,
increase our insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to
fluctuate. This same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers
and their ability to timely deliver their products. If this international
political instability continues or increases, our business and results of
operations could be harmed.

Earthquake and other uninsured risks

We
purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable
risks, however, certain other risks that are uninsurable or are insurable only
at significant costs are not mitigated via insurance. An earthquake could
significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, most of which are conducted
in California. It could also significantly delay our research and engineering
effort on new products, most of which is also conducted in California. We take
steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake, but there is
no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an
earthquake. We self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is the
prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost
and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market. Certain other
risks are also self insured either based on a similar cost benefit analysis, or
based on the unavailability of insurance. If one or more of the uninsured events
occur, we could suffer major financial loss.

Page 44

Effects of
Recent Accounting Pronouncements

We
have adopted Statement No. 143, (“SFAS 143”) “Accounting for
Obligations Associated with the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets” and
Statement No. 144 (“SFAS 144”) “Accounting for the Impairment of
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS 143 establishes accounting standards
for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its
associated asset retirement cost. It also provides guidance for legal
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. SFAS
144 establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. Adoption of these
pronouncements did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial
statements.

In
June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146 (“SFAS 146”),
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.”
SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with
exit or disposal activities, and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3, Liabilities Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). This Statement requires that a liability for
costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured
initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. SFAS 146 will be
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after March 31,
2003. The standard will in certain circumstances change the timing of
recognition of restructuring costs.

In
November 2002, EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21,
“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” This
issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one
deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement
consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of
accounting. EITF Issue No. 00-21 will be effective for revenue arrangements
entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003 or we may
elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative-effect adjustment. We
are reviewing EITF Issue No. 00-21 and have not yet determined the impact
this issue will have on our consolidated operating results and financial
position.

In
December 2002, FASB issued SFAS 148, an Amendment of SFAS 123. This Statement
amends SFAS 123, to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that
voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of that
Statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net
income of an entity’s accounting policy decisions with respect to
stock-based employee compensation. Finally, this Statement amends APB Opinion
No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure about those effects
in interim financial information. Since we are continuing to account for stock-
based compensation according to APB 25, our adoption of SFAS 148 requires us to
provide prominent disclosures about the effects of SFAS 123 on reported income
and requires us to disclose these affects in our interim consolidated financial
statements as well. SFAS 148 was effective for interim fiscal periods beginning
after December 15, 2002. Adoption of this standard had no material impact on our
consolidated operating results and financial position.

Page 45

In
January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” an Interpretation of
ARB No. 51.  FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be
consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in
the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest
or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created
or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or
acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for
the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003.  We
believe that although the adoption of this standard will result in consolidation
of certain entities, it will have no material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In
April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 149 (“SFAS No. 149”),
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments by requiring that contracts with comparable
characteristics be accounted for similarly. In particular, this statement
clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net
investment meets the characteristics of a derivative, clarifies when a
derivative contains a financing component, amends the definition of an
underlying to conform it to the language used in FIN 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” and amends certain other existing
pronouncements. The provisions of SFAS No. 149, which were not already applied
under an Implementation Issue, are effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003. We believe that the adoption of this standard will
not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of
operations.

In
 May 2003, the FASB
issued Statement No. 150 (“SFAS No. 150”), “Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for classification and
measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity. It requires financial instruments within its scope to be
classified as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of those
financial instruments were previously classified as equity. SFAS No. 150 is
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003.
For financial instruments created before and still existing as of the issuance
of this statement, a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle shall
be reported upon implementation in the first interim period beginning after June
15, 2003. We believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material
impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations.

ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We
are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates,
foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To
mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the
potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our
financial position at June 30, 2003. Actual results may differ materially.

At
the end of fiscal 2003, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income
securities of $858 million, excluding those classified as cash and cash
equivalents (detail of these securities is included in Note 4 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8, “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). These
securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate
risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market
interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as
of June 30, 2003, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $1
million.

As
of June 30, 2003, we had net forward contracts to sell $56 million in foreign
currency in order to hedge currency exposures (detail of these contracts is
incorporated by reference from Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements under “Derivative Instruments.” If we had entered into
these contracts on June 30, 2003, the U.S. dollar equivalent would be $55
million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the
contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $23 million.
However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by
the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that
the hedging of our foreign currency exposure should have no material impact on
income or cash flows.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description
of Operations and Principles of Consolidation

KLA-Tencor Corporation
(“KLA-Tencor”) is a global provider of process control and yield
management solutions for the semiconductor manufacturing and related
microelectronics industries. Headquartered in San Jose, California, KLA-Tencor
has subsidiaries both in the United States and in key markets throughout the
world.

The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of KLA-Tencor and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Partially owned, non-controlled, equity affiliates
are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.

Management
Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated
Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

KLA-Tencor has evaluated the estimated fair
value of financial instruments using available market information and valuation
methodologies as provided by the custodian. The use of different market
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on
the estimated fair value amounts. The fair value of KLA-Tencor’s cash, cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities
approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these
items.

Cash
Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid debt instruments
with remaining maturities of ninety days or less are considered to be cash
equivalents. Investments with remaining maturities greater than three months and
that mature within one year from the balance sheet date are considered to be
short-term marketable securities. Non-current marketable securities include debt
securities with maturities exceeding one year from the balance sheet date.
Short-term and non-current marketable securities are generally classified as
available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, presented as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. KLA-Tencor has classified some equity securities that have
readily determinable fair values in a similar manner. The fair value of
marketable securities is based on quoted market prices. All realized gains and
losses and unrealized losses and declines in fair value that are other than
temporary are recorded in earnings in the period of occurrence. The specific
identification method is used to determine the realized gains and losses on
investments. Certain equity securities have been classified as trading
securities. These trading securities are reported at fair value determined based
on quoted market prices at the reporting date for those instruments, with
unrealized gains or losses included in earnings for the applicable period. The
net amount of such gains and losses for the twelve months June 30, 2003 were not
material. As of June 30, 2003, the fair value of the trading securities was $10
million.

Page 53

Non
Marketable Equity Securities and Other Investments

KLA-Tencor acquires
certain equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic
objectives, and to the extent these investments continue to have strategic
value, the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate the
inherent market risks. Non-marketable equity securities and other investments
are accounted for at historical cost or, if KLA-Tencor has significant influence
over the investee, using the equity method of accounting. KLA-Tencor’s
proportionate share of income or losses from investments is accounted for under
the equity method and any gain or loss is recorded in interest income and other,
net. Non-marketable equity securities, equity-method investments, and other
investments are included in “Other assets” on the balance sheet.
Non-marketable equity securities are subject to a periodic impairment review;
however, there are no open-market valuations, and the impairment analysis
requires significant judgment. This analysis includes assessment of the
investee’s financial condition, the business outlook for its products and
technology, its projected results and cash flow, the likelihood of obtaining
subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity
preferences held by KLA-Tencor or others. If an investee obtains additional
funding at a valuation lower than KLA-Tencor’s carrying amount, it is
presumed that the investment is other than temporarily impaired, unless specific
facts and circumstances indicate otherwise, for example if KLA-Tencor holds
contractual rights that include a preference over the rights of other investors.
Impairment of non-marketable equity securities is recorded in interest income
and other, net.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or
market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and reserves
are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value.
KLA-Tencor reviews the adequacy of its inventory reserves on a quarterly basis.
Its methodology involves matching its on-hand and on-order inventory with its
demand forecast. For parts that are in excess of its forecasted demand,
KLA-Tencor takes appropriate reserves to reflect risk of obsolescence. If actual
demand declined below its forecast, KLA-Tencor may need to take additional
inventory reserves.

Property
and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of
property and equipment is based on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which are thirty to thirty-five years for buildings,
ten to fifteen years for leasehold improvements, five to seven years for
furniture and fixtures, and three to five years for machinery and equipment.
Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method over the
shorter of the life of the related asset or the term of the underlying lease.
Construction in process does not depreciate until the assets are placed in
service.

Intangible
Assets

Purchased technology, patents, trademarks, favorable leases and
goodwill are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Effective July
1, 2001, KLA-Tencor replaced ratable amortization of goodwill with periodic
testing of goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and
Intangible Assets.” Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized
over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.

Software
Development Costs

Development costs incurred in the research and development
of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological
feasibility of the product has been established. Software development costs
incurred after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized up
to the time the product is available for general release to customers. At June
30, 2003 and 2002, there were no amounts capitalized as KLA-Tencor’s
current development process is essentially completely concurrent with the
establishment of technological feasibility.

Page 54

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

KLA-Tencor evaluates the carrying value of its
long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of the asset may be impaired in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” An impairment loss is
recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of
the asset including disposition, is less than the carrying value of the asset.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject KLA-Tencor to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
equivalents, short-term and non-current marketable securities, trade accounts
receivable and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.
KLA-Tencor invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as, but not
limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate and municipal bonds, U.S.
Treasury and agency securities, equity securities and, by policy, limits the
amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial
issuer. KLA-Tencor has not experienced any material credit losses on its
investments.

A
majority of KLA-Tencor’s trade receivables are derived from sales to large
multinational semiconductor manufacturers located throughout the world.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is considered to
be limited due to its customer base and the diversity of its geographic sales
areas. KLA-Tencor performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
financial condition and generally requires no collateral to secure accounts
receivable. KLA-Tencor maintains a provision for potential credit losses based
upon expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. In addition, KLA-Tencor
may utilize letters of credit or non-recourse factoring to mitigate credit risk
when considered appropriate.

KLA-Tencor
is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on
the foreign exchange contracts used in hedging activities. These counterparties
are large international financial institutions and to date, no such counterparty
has failed to meet its financial obligations to us. KLA-Tencor does not
anticipate nonperformance by these counterparties.

Foreign
Currency

The functional currencies of KLA-Tencor’s significant foreign
subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. Accordingly, all assets and
liabilities of the foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars at current
period end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated to U.S.
dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period. The gains and
losses from foreign currency translation of these subsidiaries’ financial
statements are recorded directly into a separate component of stockholders’
equity under the caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Page 55

KLA-Tencor’s
subsidiaries in Israel use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated using
exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, except for non-monetary
assets, such as inventories and property, plant and equipment that are
translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs are translated
using average exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to those
balance sheet items that are translated using historical exchange rates. The
resulting translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations as incurred.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

KLA-Tencor uses financial instruments, such as forward
exchange contracts, to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated
foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months.
The purpose of KLA-Tencor’s foreign currency program is to manage the
effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated
revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The effect of exchange rate changes on
forward exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate
changes on the underlying hedged items. KLA-Tencor believes these financial
instruments do not subject it to speculative risk that would otherwise result
from changes in currency exchange rates. KLA-Tencor does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

All
of KLA-Tencor’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value
based upon quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative
instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign
currency denominated transactions, the effective portion of the gain or loss on
these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income in stockholders’ equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the
hedged transaction affects earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to
occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the
associated financial instrument is recorded immediately in earnings. For
derivative instruments used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated
assets or liabilities, the gain or loss on these hedges is recorded immediately
in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities
being hedged.

At
June 30, 2003, KLA-Tencor had foreign exchange forward contracts maturing
throughout fiscal 2004 to sell $215 million and purchase $159 million, in
foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen. At June 30, 2002, KLA-Tencor had
foreign exchange forward contracts maturing throughout fiscal 2003 to sell $155
million and purchase $40 million, in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen.
All foreign exchange forward contracts are carried on the consolidated balance
sheets at fair market value. See Note 8 for further information related to
derivatives and hedging activities.

Warranty

KLA-Tencor provides standard warranty coverage on its systems for twelve
months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the
warranty period. KLA-Tencor accounts for the estimated warranty cost as a charge
to cost of sales when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is
based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual
service records, KLA-Tencor calculates the average service hours and parts
expense per system and applies the actual labor and overhead rates to determine
the estimated warranty charge. KLA-Tencor updates these estimated charges every
quarter. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may
differ, and in those cases KLA-Tencor adjusts warranty accruals accordingly (see
Note 8 “Commitments and Contingencies”).

Page 56

Revenue
Recognition

In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.” The SEC Staff addressed several issues in SAB 101, including
the timing of revenue recognition for sales that involve contractual customer
acceptance provisions and installation of the product if these events occur
after shipment and transfer of title. KLA-Tencor implemented the provisions of
SAB 101 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001, retroactive to July 1, 2000. Prior
to adoption of SAB 101, KLA-Tencor’s general policy was to recognize
revenue on shipment.

KLA-Tencor
derives revenue from four sources – system sales, spare part sales, service
contracts and software license fees. System sales include hardware and software
that is incidental to the product. Prior to the implementation of SAB 101,
system revenue was generally recognized upon shipment. Effective July 1, 2000,
KLA-Tencor changed its method of accounting for system sales to generally
recognize revenue upon a positive affirmation by the customer that the system
has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications.
In certain limited cases, KLA-Tencor may deviate from the need for a written
acceptance by the customer, as follows:

o
When system sales to independent distributors have no installation, contain no
acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is
recognized on shipment;

o
When the system requires no integration and installation is inconsequential,
revenue is recognized on shipment. In these cases KLA-Tencor is required to
perform the installation but KLA-Tencor considers installation not essential to
the functionality of the equipment, and there are no additional tests required
to be performed on-site. In addition, third party distributors and customers
regularly complete the installation of these tools;

o
When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same
specifications on the same process, for the same application, and it can be
objectively demonstrated that it meets all of the required acceptance criteria
upon shipment, a portion of revenue can be recognized at the time of shipment.
Revenue recognized upon shipment is exclusive of the amount allocable to the
installation element. Revenue attributable to the installation element is the
higher of the payment amount due upon acceptance or the fair value of
installation;

o
When the system is performing in production and meets all published and
contractually agreed specifications, but the customer withholds signature on our
acceptance document due to warranty or other issues unrelated to product
performance;

o When the system is
damaged during transit, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from
the customer.

Total
revenue recognized under conditions where KLA-Tencor deviates from the need for
a written acceptance by the customer were approximately 3.1% of total revenue
for fiscal year 2003 and 2.5% of total revenue for fiscal years 2002 and 2001.
Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the
related shipping costs are included in cost of sales.

Page 57

In
accordance with SAB 101, KLA-Tencor also allows for multiple element revenue
arrangement in cases where certain elements of a sales contract are not
delivered and accepted at the same time. In such cases, KLA-Tencor defers the
fair value of the unaccepted element until that element is delivered to and
accepted by the customer. To be considered a separate element, the product or
service in question must represent a separate earnings process, and is not
essential to the functionality of the delivered and accepted portion of the same
sales contract. If the unaccepted element is essential to the functionality of
the delivered and accepted portion, the whole amount of the sales contract is
deferred until all elements are accepted.

Spare
parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has
passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.

Service
and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance
contract. If maintenance is included in an arrangement, which includes a
software license agreement, amounts related to maintenance are allocated based
on vendor specific objective evidence. Non-standard warranty includes services
incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months.
Non-standard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably
as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Consulting and
training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed.

Revenue
from software license fees is typically recognized upon shipment if collection
of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and
vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee
to any undelivered elements of the arrangement. Such undelivered elements in
these arrangements typically consist of services and/or upgrades. If
vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements
of the arrangement, all revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist, or
until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. In instances where an
arrangement to deliver software requires significant modification or
customization, license fees are recognized under the percentage of completion
method of contract accounting. Allowances are established for potential product
returns and credit losses. To date, revenue from license fees have been less
than 10% of total revenue.

Page 58

As
a result of implementing SAB 101, KLA-Tencor changed its method of accounting
for revenue recognition. This change resulted in cumulative deferred revenue of
$660.9 million as of July 1, 2000, which was recorded as a non-cash charge of
$306.4 million (after reduction for product and warranty costs of $207 million
and income taxes of $147.5 million). The deferred profit balance as of June 30,
2003 and 2002 was $177 million and 194 million, respectively and equals the
amount of system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment but deferred
under SAB 101 less applicable product and warranty costs. KLA-Tencor also defers
the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned
revenue. The unearned revenue balance as of June 30, 2003 and 2002 was $48
million and $55 million, respectively.

Advertising Expenses

KLA-Tencor expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses for
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $4 million, $3 million and $6
million respectively.

Strategic
Development Agreements

Net engineering, research and development expenses
were partially offset by $18 million, $14 million and $8 million in external
funding received under certain strategic development programs conducted with
several of KLA-Tencor’s customers and government grants in fiscal 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

Income
Taxes

KLA-Tencor accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability
approach. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for future taxable amounts and
deferred tax assets are recognized for future deductions.

Earnings
Per Share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by
dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is calculated by using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period and gives effect to all dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period. The reconciling difference between the
computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods presented is
the inclusion of the dilutive effect of stock options issued to employees under
employee stock option plans.

Options
to purchase 5,270,681, 282,746 and 4,459,862 shares of KLA-Tencor’s common
stock were outstanding at June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively, but not
included in the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise price was
greater than the average market price of common shares in each respective year.
The exercise price ranges of these options were $39.35 to $68.00, $52.75 to
$68.00 and $44.69 to $68.00 at June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Plans

KLA-Tencor accounts for its employee
stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the recognition and
measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation is
reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant. In December 2002, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148 (SFAS 148), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure.” This Statement amends SFAS 123, to provide
alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. It
also amends the disclosure provisions of that Statement to require prominent
disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity’s
accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation.
Finally, this Statement amends APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting,
to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information.
Since KLA-Tencor continues to account for stock-based compensation according to
APB 25, its adoption of SFAS No. 148 required the Company to provide prominent
disclosures about the effects of SFAS 123 on reported income and required the
Company to disclose these affects in the financial statements as well.

Page 59

Pro
forma information regarding net income and net income per share is required by
SFAS 123, and has been determined as if KLA-Tencor had accounted for its
employee stock purchase plan and employee stock options granted subsequent to
June 30, 1995, under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model and the single option approach with the following
weighted-average assumptions:

SFAS
No. 123 requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for
use in valuing employee stock options. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model
was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the price volatility
of the underlying stock. Because the company’s employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in the opinion of management, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee
stock options.

Page 60

For
purposes of pro forma disclosures required by SFAS 123, the estimated fair value
of the options is amortized to expense over the options’ vesting periods
using straight-line method. KLA-Tencor’s pro forma information is as
follows:

Page 61

Reclassifications

Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current
financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on
previously reported results of operations or stockholders’ equity.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2002, KLA-Tencor adopted Statement No. 143
(“SFAS 143”), “Accounting for Obligations Associated with the
Retirement of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS 143 establishes accounting standards
for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its
associated asset retirement cost. It also provides guidance for legal
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets.
Adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements

In
November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21,
“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” This
issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one
deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement
consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of
accounting. EITF Issue No. 00-21 will be effective for revenue arrangements
entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003 or the Company
may elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative-effect adjustment.
The Company believes that the adoption of this standard will have no material
impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In
January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” an Interpretation of
ARB No. 51.  FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be
consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in
the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest
or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created
or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or
acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for
the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003.  The
Company believes that although the adoption of this standard will result in
consolidation of certain entities, it will have no material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 149 (“SFAS No. 149”),
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments by requiring that contracts with comparable
characteristics be accounted for similarly. In particular, this statement
clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net
investment meets the characteristics of a derivative, clarifies when a
derivative contains a financing component, amends the definition of an
underlying to conform it to the language used in FIN 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” and amends certain other existing
pronouncements. The provisions of SFAS No. 149, which were not already applied
under an Implementation Issue, are effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003. The Company believes that the adoption of this
standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or
statement of operations.

In
May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150 (“SFAS No. 150”),
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for
classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires financial
instruments within its scope be classified as a liability (or an asset in some
circumstances). Many of those financial instruments were previously classified
as equity. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003. For financial instruments created before and still
existing as of the issuance of this statement, a cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle shall be reported upon implementation in the first interim
period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company believes that the adoption of
this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet
or statement of operations.

Restructuring and Other Charges

In fiscal 2003, KLA-Tencor
restructured certain of its operations to realign costs with planned business levels in light of  the industry
downturn.  Restructuring costs were classified into two main categories: facilities and other charges of $4.6 million and
severance and benefits of $1.1 million.  As part of the facilities consolidation, KLA-Tencor exited several of its leased
buildings and has included the remaining net book value of the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease
payments, net of anticipated sublease revenue, in the charge.  Severance and benefit charges were related to the involuntary
termination of approximately 70 personnel from manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and administration in the United
States, Japan and Europe.  The restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2003 are proceeding as planned, with the termination of
employees having been completed and the facilities related lease payments scheduled to be completed by the end of fiscal 2004. In
addition, during the first fiscal quarter of 2003, KLA-Tencor received $15.2 million as a second and final installment on the sale
of software and intellectual property associated with its iSupport(TM)on-line customer support technology, which was netted against
the above non-recurring charges, resulting in a reported net gain of $9.4 million.  In addition to the restructuring action,
KLA-Tencor also recorded severance charges totaling $10.9 million in operating expenses, throughout fiscal 2003, relating to a
series of employee involuntary terminations.

In
fiscal 2002, there were no restructuring charges. KLA-Tencor recorded severance
charges of $8.5 million in operating expenses relating to a series of employee
involuntary terminations throughout fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2001, in
response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry, KLA-Tencor implemented a
restructuring plan to reduce spending. Charges related to its restructuring plan
included: facilities of $4.7 million, severance and benefits of $1.6 million,
and other costs of $1.0 million. Facilities related charges were associated with
two leased office buildings that were vacated and included the remaining net
book value of the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease
payments, net of anticipated sublease revenue in the charge. During fiscal 2001,
KLA-Tencor reduced its workforce by approximately 5%, primarily in the
manufacturing areas and recorded severance charges related to these
terminations. The restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2001 were substantially
completed at the end of fiscal 2002. In addition, during the fourth fiscal
quarter of 2001, KLA-Tencor sold software and intellectual property associated
with its

iSupport

™ on-line customer support technology and recorded
$10.0 million pretax, non-recurring income, which was netted with the other
non-recurring charges.

Page 65

The
following table shows the details of the facilities, severance and other
restructuring costs accrual for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003:

Acquisitions

During
fiscal years 2002 and 2001, KLA-Tencor completed certain purchase acquisitions.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of each
business from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not
been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material on
either an individual or aggregate basis. For a period of up to twelve months
from the acquisition date, KLA-Tencor may change its original purchase price
allocation for pre-acquisition uncertainties. After twelve months, KLA-Tencor
records the fair value of such reasonably estimable contingencies.

The
amounts allocated to in-process research and development (“in-process
R&D”) were determined through established valuation techniques in the
high-technology equipment industry and were expensed upon acquisition because
technology feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses
existed. Amounts allocated to purchased intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods not exceeding five years.

A

United
States federal income taxes have not been provided for the undistributed
earnings of two of KLA-Tencor’s foreign subsidiaries. These undistributed
earnings aggregated $31 million at June 30, 2003, and it is the Company’s
intention that such undistributed earnings be permanently reinvested. The
Company has tax credits at June 30, 2003 totaling $129 million, of which $4
million will begin to expire in 2008 and $38 million will begin to expire in
2021. The Company enjoys tax holidays in Israel where it manufactures certain of
its products. These tax holidays are scheduled to expire at varying times within
the next ten years. During the last three fiscal years, the effect of these tax
holidays has not had a material impact on the Company’s net income and net
income per share.

NOTE 6 -
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Stockholders’
Rights Plan

In March 1989, KLA-Tencor implemented a plan to protect
stockholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of KLA-Tencor.
Each stockholder under the plan is entitled to one right per common stock owned.
The Plan was amended in April 1996. The Plan provides that if any person or
group acquires 15% or more of KLA-Tencor’s common stock, each right not
owned by such person or group will entitle its holder to purchase, at the
then-current exercise price, KLA-Tencor’s common stock at a value of twice
that exercise price. As amended to date, under the Plan, the rights are
redeemable at KLA-Tencor’s option for $0.01 per right and expire in April
2006.

Stock
Repurchase Program

In July 1997, the Board of Directors authorized
KLA-Tencor to systematically repurchase shares of its common stock in the open
market. This plan was entered into to reduce the dilution from KLA-Tencor’s
employee benefit and incentive plans such as the stock option and employee stock
purchase plans. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997 through
June 30, 2003 the Board of Directors had authorized KLA-Tencor to repurchase a
total of 17.8 million shares, including 5 million shares authorized in October
2002. In fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, KLA-Tencor repurchased 1,972,000,
3,341,000 and 4,580,000 shares at an average price of $33.42, $36.89 and $33.54
per share, respectively. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997
through June 30, 2002, KLA-Tencor has repurchased a total of 13,321,000 shares
at an average price of $32.70 per share, with an additional 4.5 million
available for repurchase under the plan . All such shares remain as treasury
shares.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

KLA-Tencor’s employee stock purchase plan provides
that eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their eligible earnings
toward the semi-annual purchase of KLA-Tencor’s common stock. The
employee’s purchase price is derived from a formula based on the fair
market value of the common stock at the time of enrollment into the Offering
period versus the fair market value on the date of purchase. Offering periods
are generally two years in length. As the plan is non-compensatory under APB 25,
no compensation expense is recorded in connection with the plan. In fiscal years
2003, 2002 and 2001 employees purchased 1,071,571, 1,155,213 and 1,275,837 of
shares issued at a weighted average fair value of $30.26, $29.72 and $28.59
respectively. The plan shares are replenished annually on the first day of each
fiscal year by virtue of an evergreen provision. The provision allows for share
replenishment equal to the lesser of 2,000,000 shares or the number of shares
which the Company estimates will be required to issue under the plan during the
forthcoming fiscal year. At June 30, 2003, a total of 930,769 shares were
reserved and available for issuance under this plan.

Stock
Option and Incentive Plans

KLA-Tencor’s stock option program is a
broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain
qualified management and technical employees (“knowledge employees”),
and align stockholder and employee interests. Under KLA-Tencor’s stock
option plans, options generally have a vesting period of five years, are
exercisable for a period not to exceed ten years from the date of issuance and
are granted at prices not less than the fair market value of KLA-Tencor’s
common stock at the grant date. This program consists of three plans: one under
which non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our
stock, another in which officers, key employees, consultants and all other
employees may be granted options and a third in which consultants and all
employees other than directors and officers may be granted options to purchase
shares of our stock. Substantially all of our employees that meet established
performance goals and that qualify as knowledge employees participate in one of
our stock option plans. Options granted to officers and employees from fiscal
year 2000 through June 30, 2003 are summarized as follows (in thousands):

During
fiscal 2003, the Company granted options to purchase approximately 4.9 million
shares of stock to employees. After deducting options forfeited the net grant of
options was 2.5 million shares. The net options granted after forfeiture
represented 1.3% of weighted average outstanding shares of approximately 189.8
million as of June 30, 2003.

Options
granted to the top five officers, who represent the chief executive officer and
each of the four other most highly compensated executive officers whose salary
plus bonus exceeded $100,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, as a
percentage of the total options granted to all employees vary from year to year.
In 2003, there were 270,000 options granted to the top five officers. In fiscal
2002, options granted to the top five officers were a higher percentage of the
total grants than in the other years shown because the Board of Directors
approved additional grants to the CEO in recognition of his future potential to
lead the corporation. The additional grants to the CEO totaled 227,400 options
with vesting on said grants extended for up to an eight-year period.

All
stock option grants to officers are approved by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors. All members of the Compensation Committee are
independent directors, as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on
the NASDAQ Stock Market.

Page 71

The following table summarizes KLA-Tencor's stock option plans as of June 30, 2003:

(1) In July 2003,  an  additional  5,750,290  securities  were  reserved for  issuance in  accordance  with the stock option  plan's
    evergreen feature.

(2) Officers and directors are not eligible to receive options granted under this plan.

In
order to retain the incentive value for many new employees who had stock option
grants with exercise prices that were far out of the money, in December 2000,
569 employees of KLA-Tencor were offered the opportunity to participate in a
surrender program. This program applied to less than 9 percent of total
employees and less than 5 percent of total options outstanding. The program
allowed participating employees to exchange their stock options with exercise
prices over $55.00 per share and all subsequently issued options for a promise
to issue new options no sooner than six months and two days after the
cancellation of the forfeited options. Employees who elected to participate in
the exchange program were required to exchange all options issued during the
period six months prior to December 2000 as well forgo any grant of new options
during the six months subsequent to December 2000. The new options were granted
on July 10, 2001 at the NASDAQ market closing price of $46.67. The terms of the
new option replicated the surrendered option. Only 49 percent of eligible
employees elected to participate in this program. A total of 278 employees
surrendered an aggregate of 722,814 options with exercise prices ranging from
$26.25 to $68.00 per share or an average exercise price of $45.46 per share.

Page 72

The
activity under the option plans, combined, was as follows:

(1) In addition in August 2003,
  KLA-Tencor  granted 1.4 million  stock  options (1.3 million to non  -executive  employees  and 0.1
million to executive employees) as part of the fiscal year 2002 annual performance cycle review of KLA-Tencor.

NOTE 7
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

KLA-Tencor
has a profit sharing program for eligible employees, which distributes on a
quarterly basis, a percentage of pretax profits. In addition, KLA-Tencor has an
employee savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Starting fiscal year 2000,
KLA-Tencor has matched up to a maximum of $1,000 or 50% of the first $2,000 of an
eligible employee’s contribution, with $500 of the amount funded from the
profit sharing program. The total charge to operations under the profit sharing
and 401(k) programs aggregated $10 million, $3 million and $57 million in fiscal
years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. KLA-Tencor has no defined benefit plans
in the United States. In addition to the profit sharing plan and the U.S.
employee saving plan, several of KLA-Tencor’s foreign subsidiaries have
retirement plans for their full time employees, several of which are defined
benefit plans.

Net
periodic pension cost for defined benefit pension plans is determined in
accordance with FAS 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

, and is
made up of several components that reflect different aspects of the
Company’s pension-related financial arrangements and the cost of benefits
earned by participating employees. These components are determined using certain
actuarial assumptions. Summary data relating to the Company’s foreign
defined benefit pension plans, including key weighted average assumptions used
is provided in the following tables:

The
components of KLA-Tencor's net periodic cost relating to its foreign
subsidiaries defined pension plans are as follow:

KLA-Tencor
has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan whereby certain executives may
defer a portion of their salary and bonus. Participants are credited with
returns based on their allocation of their account balances among mutual funds.
The Company controls the investment of these funds and the participants remain
general creditors of the Company. Distributions from the plan commence the
quarter following a participant’s retirement or termination of employment.
At June 30, 2003, KLA-Tencor had a deferred compensation liability under the
plan of $78 million included as a component of other current liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 8 -
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Factoring

KLA-Tencor has agreements with two Japanese banking institutions to sell certain
of its trade receivables and promissory notes without recourse. During fiscal
2003 and 2002, approximately $99 million and $98 million of receivables were
sold under these arrangements, respectively.

As of June 30, 2003 and
2002, approximately $27 million and $48 million were outstanding, respectively.
The total amount available under the facility is the Japanese yen equivalent of
$92 million based upon exchange rates as of June 30, 2003.

KLA-Tencor
does not believe it is materially at risk for any losses as a result of these
agreements.

Facilities

KLA-Tencor leases certain of its facilities under operating leases, which
qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS 13, “Accounting
for Leases,” and, as such, these facilities are not included on its
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Rent expense was approximately $16.2
million, $20.3 million and $21.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

The lease
agreement for certain Milpitas and San Jose, California facilities had a term of
five years ending in November 2002, with an option to extend up to two more
years. Under the terms of the lease, KLA-Tencor, at its option, could acquire
the properties at their original cost or arrange for the properties to be
acquired. In November 2002, the Company purchased these facilities at the end of
the lease term. The purchase transaction increased land and property by
approximately $120 million and decreased cash by the same amount.

Purchase
Commitments

KLA-Tencor maintains certain open inventory purchase commitments
with its suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key
components. KLA-Tencor’s liability in these purchase commitments is
generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon
between the parties. This forecast time-horizon can vary amongst different
suppliers. The Company’s open inventory purchase commitments were less than
$42 million as of June 30, 2003.

Guarantees

During the quarter ended December 31, 2002 KLA-Tencor adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”), ”
Guarantor’s Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Indebtedness of
Others.” FIN 45 requires disclosures concerning KLA-Tencor’s
obligations under certain guarantees.

In
connection with certain business combinations and purchased technology
transactions, KLA-Tencor was subject to certain contingent consideration
arrangements at June 30, 2003. These arrangements are based upon sales volume or
the occurrence of other events subsequent to the acquisition and lapse in fiscal
years 2004 to 2005. The payment of the contingency would result in an increase
to goodwill or operating expenses. Amounts paid under these arrangements have
not been and are not expected to have a material effect on KLA-Tencor’s
financial condition or results of operations and could range, in aggregate from
$2.2 million to $3.6 million.

Subject
to certain limitations, KLA-Tencor indemnifies its current and former officers
and directors for certain events or occurrences. Although the maximum potential
amount of future payments KLA-Tencor could be required to make under these
agreements is theoretically unlimited, based on prior experience, we believe the
fair value of this liability is de minimis and no liability has been recorded.

Legal
Matters

KLA-Tencor is named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the
normal course of our business. Litigation, in general, and intellectual property
and securities litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to
normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings
are difficult to predict. KLA-Tencor believes that it has defenses in each of
the cases set forth below and is vigorously contesting each of these matters.

ADE Corporation

On
October 11, 2000, ADE Corporation (“ADE”), a competitor, filed a
patent infringement lawsuit against KLA-Tencor in the U.S. District Court in
Delaware. ADE claimed damages and sought an injunction under U.S. Patent No.
6,118,525 (“'525 patent”). KLA-Tencor filed a counterclaim in the same
court alleging that ADE has infringed four of our patents. KLA-Tencor is seeking
damages and a permanent injunction against ADE. In addition, KLA-Tencor is
seeking a declaration from the District Court that ADE’s patent is invalid
and not infringed by KLA-Tencor. On October 22, 2001, KLA-Tencor filed a
separate action for declaratory judgment against ADE in the Northern District of
California requesting a declaration that U.S. Patent No. 6,292,259 (“'259
patent”) is invalid and not infringed. That action has now been
consolidated with the prior action in the Delaware proceeding, and ADE has
amended its complaint in that proceeding to allege that KLA-Tencor is infringing
the ‘259 patent. On August 8, 2002, the magistrate presiding over the
action issued a recommendation that the court enter summary judgment in favor of
KLA-Tencor on the issue of non-infringement under ADE’s ‘525 patent.
On the same day, the magistrate issued recommendations that the court enter
summary judgment in favor of ADE on the issue of non-infringement of two of
KLA-Tencor’s patents. The district court judge subsequently substantially
adopted the recommendations of the magistrate regarding claims construction.

Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd.

On June 27,  2001,
 KLA-Tencor  sued Tokyo  Seimitsu  Co. Ltd.  and TSK America Inc.  ("TSK"),  a  competitor,  in the U.S.
District Court in the Northern District of California  alleging that TSK infringes on one of the Company's  patents.  The suit seeks
damages and an injunction  under U.S. Patent No.  4,805,123  ("`123  patent").  TSK filed a counterclaim in the same court seeking a
declaration  that the `123 patent is invalid,  unenforceable  and not  infringed,  and also alleged  violations of the antitrust and
unfair  competition  laws.  The  district  court judge has entered a ruling that calls into  question  the validity of the patent in
suit.  KLA-Tencor is examining remedies in connection with that determination.

NOTE 9 –
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Under
its foreign-currency risk management strategy, KLA-Tencor utilizes derivative
instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings
and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial
exposure is monitored and managed by KLA-Tencor as an integral part of its
overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of
financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the
volatility of these markets may have on its operating results. KLA-Tencor
continues its policy of hedging its current and anticipated foreign currency
exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to twelve months.

Page 78

On July 1, 2001, KLA-Tencor
adopted SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (SFAS 133). SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be recorded
on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
which do not qualify, or are not effective as hedges must be recognized
currently in earnings. Upon adoption KLA-Tencor recognized the fair value of
foreign currency forward contracts, previously held off balance sheet, and
reflected their fair value on the balance sheet. These were principally offset
by recording on the balance sheet the change in value of the hedged item,
generally forecasted shipments. KLA-Tencor did not separately report a
cumulative transition adjustment to earnings upon adoption of the standard as
the impact was immaterial. All derivatives were reflected at fair value on the
balance sheet at that date.

Cashflow Hedges

KLA-Tencor’s
international sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. For foreign
currency denominated sales, however, the volatility of the foreign currency
markets represents risk to KLA-Tencor’s margins. KLA-Tencor defines its
exposure as the risk of changes in the functional-currency-equivalent cash flows
(generally U.S. dollar) attributable to changes in the related foreign currency
exchange rates. Upon forecasting the exposure, KLA-Tencor hedges with forward
sales contracts whose critical terms are designed to match those of the
underlying exposure. These hedges are evaluated for effectiveness at least
quarterly using regression analysis. Ineffectiveness is measured by comparing
the change in value of the forward contracts to the change in value of the
underlying transaction, with the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in
Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Any measured ineffectiveness is included
immediately in “Interest income and other, net” in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Deferred hedge gains and losses and OCI associated
with hedges of foreign currency sales are reclassified to revenue upon
recognition in income of the underlying hedged exposure. All amounts reported in
OCI at June 30, 2003 are anticipated to be reclassified to revenue within twelve
months. At June 30, 2003, KLA-Tencor had cash flow hedge contracts, maturing
throughout fiscal year 2004 to sell $66 million and purchase $7 million, in
foreign currency, primarily in Japanese yen. The following table summarizes
hedging activity in the OCI account during the years ended June 30, (in
thousands):

Other Foreign Currency Hedges

KLA-Tencor
hedges its monetary non-functional assets and liabilities, and those of its
subsidiaries. SFAS 52 requires that such monetary assets and liabilities be
remeasured periodically for changes in the rate of exchange against the
entities’ functional currency. Changes in value of these assets and
liabilities are recorded in “Interest income and other, net” in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The volatility of the non-functional
currencies together with the requirement to remeasure non-functional assets and
liabilities may result in some volatility to KLA-Tencor’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations if left unhedged. In order to mitigate these effects,
KLA-Tencor enters into remeasurement hedges which are forward contracts used to
offset the foreign currency positions represented by non-functional monetary
assets and liabilities. Remeasurement hedges are not SFAS 133 designated hedges,
thus changes in value of the remeasurement hedges are recorded currently in
earnings. Changes in the values of underlying monetary non-functional assets and
liabilities are also recorded currently in earnings and should offset the change
in value of the hedges. At June 30, 2003, KLA-Tencor had other foreign currency
hedge contracts maturing throughout fiscal 2004 to sell $149 million and
purchase $152 million, in foreign currency, primarily in Japanese yen.

Page 79

NOTE 10 –
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Effective
July 1, 2001, KLA-Tencor adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
141, “Business Combinations,” and No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” Under these accounting standards, KLA-Tencor ceased
amortization of goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to
July 1, 2001, and reclassified amounts attributed to workforce in acquisitions
made prior to July 1, 2001 that did not meet the criteria for separate
recognition as other intangible assets under SFAS 141 to goodwill. The net
carrying value of goodwill recorded through acquisitions is $16.2 million as of
June 30, 2003. In accordance with SFAS 142, KLA-Tencor in fiscal 2003 evaluated
the goodwill for impairment and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill.

The
following table reflects the components of other intangible assets as of June
30, 2003 (in thousands):

Other
intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, as a result of the
discontinuation of a product, management evaluated certain intangible assets for
impairment. Using a fair-value approach based on discounted future cash flows,
management determined that these assets were impaired. For the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2003 amortization expense for other intangible assets was $4.2 million,
including an impairment charge of $2.0 million. For the years ended June 30,
2002 and 2001, amortization expense for other intangible assets was $2.1 million
and $1.0 million, respectively. KLA-Tencor will continue to review the carrying
value of the other intangible assets in relation to the fair value of the
discounted cash flows. Based on intangibles assets recorded at June 30, 2003,
and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the annual
estimated amortization expense is expected to be as follows (in thousands):

NOTE 11 –
SEGMENT REPORTING AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

In
fiscal 1999, KLA-Tencor adopted SFAS 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information.” SFAS 131 establishes standards for
reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements
and requires that certain selected information about operating segments be
reported in interim financial reports. It also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, and geographic areas. Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision
maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in
assessing performance. KLA-Tencor’s chief operating decision makers are the
Chief Executive Officer and the President/Chief Operating Officer.

KLA-Tencor is engaged primarily in designing, manufacturing, and marketing yield management and process monitoring systems
for the semiconductor industry.  All operating units have been aggregated due to their inter-dependencies, commonality of long-term
economic characteristics, products and services, the production processes, class of customer and distribution processes.  Since
KLA-Tencor operates in one segment, all financial segment information required by SFAS 131 can be found in the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

KLA-Tencor's  significant  operations  outside  the  United  States  include a  manufacturing  facility  in Israel  and sales,
marketing  and service  offices in Western  Europe,  Japan,  and the Asia Pacific  region.  For  geographical  reporting,  revenues are
attributed  to the  geographic  location in which the customer is located.  Long-lived  assets  consist of net property and  equipment,
goodwill,  capitalized  software and other  intangibles,  and other long-term assets,  excluding  long-term deferred tax assets and are
attributed to the geographic  location in which they are located.  The following is a summary of operations by entities  located within
the indicated geographic areas for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Page 81

The
following is a summary of revenues by major products for fiscal years 2003, 2002
and 2001 (as a percentage of total revenue).

For
the fiscal period ended June 30, 2003, one customer accounted for 11% of
revenues and two customers accounted for 13% and 11% of accounts receivable. No
single customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues or accounts receivable
for the fiscal periods ended June 30, 2002 and 2001.
