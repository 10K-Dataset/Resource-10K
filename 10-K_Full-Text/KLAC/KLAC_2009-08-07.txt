PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

The Company

KLA-Tencor Corporation (“KLA-Tencor” or the “Company” and also referred to as “we” or “our”) is a leading supplier
of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our products are also used in a number of other industries, including light emitting diode (“LED”), data storage, solar process
development and control, and general materials research.

Within our primary area of focus, our comprehensive portfolio of products,
services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication process—from research and development to final volume production. These products and
solutions are designed to help customers accelerate their development and production ramp cycles, to achieve higher and more stable semiconductor die yields, and to improve overall profitability.

KLA-Tencor’s products and services are used by the vast majority of wafer, IC, disk and reticle manufacturers in the world. These customers turn to
us for inline wafer and IC defect monitoring, review and classification; reticle defect inspection and metrology; packaging and interconnect inspection; critical dimension (“CD”) metrology; pattern overlay metrology; film thickness,
surface topography and composition measurements; measurement of in-chamber process conditions, wafer shape and stress metrology; computational lithography tools; and overall yield and fab-wide data management and analysis systems. Our advanced
products, coupled with our unique yield management services, allow us to deliver the solutions our customers need to accelerate their yield learning rates and significantly reduce their risks and costs.

KLA-Tencor Corporation was formed in April 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments Corporation and Tencor Instruments, two long-time leaders in the
semiconductor equipment industry that had originally begun operations in 1975 and 1976, respectively.

Industry

General Background

The semiconductor or chip industry is KLA-Tencor’s core focus. The semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round
disk that is six, eight or twelve inches in diameter, about as thick as a credit card and gray in color. The process of manufacturing wafers is itself highly sophisticated, involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a
vat of molten silicon. The ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish.



The manufacturing cycle of an IC is grouped into three phases: design, fabrication and testing. IC design
involves the architectural layout of the circuit, as well as design verification and reticle generation. The fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors, semiconductors or insulators. The
deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns, remove portions of the film layers, and perform other functions such as heat treatment, measurement and inspection. Most advanced chip
designs require hundreds of individual steps, many of which are performed multiple times. Most chips consist of two main structures: the lower structure, typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions
of the chip; and the upper “interconnect” structure, typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure. When all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated, each chip on the wafer is tested for
functionality. The wafer is then cut into individual devices, and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged. Final testing is performed on all packaged chips.

Current Trends

Companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new
technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market. During past industry cycles, semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends, such as a specific
design rule shrink. In today’s market, driven by consumer demand for low-cost electronic goods from smart phones and MP3 players to laptops and portable devices, the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of
new process technologies into production at the same time, some requiring new substrate and film materials, new geometries and advanced lithography techniques.

While many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing, significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected their adoption
into full-volume production. For example, as design rules decrease, yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects, while device performance characteristics (namely speed, capacity or power management) become more sensitive to such
parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation. New process materials, such as high-k dielectrics, silicon-on-insulator (“SOI”) wafers and immersion lithography-capable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can
be used in the manufacturing process. Moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face.

The continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multi-level circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to
manufacture these devices. Construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over $5 billion, substantially more than previous generation facilities. In addition, recent global economic conditions have delayed new fab builds,
upgrades and expansions. As a result, chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment.

By developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume
production, we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment (“ROI”). Once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume, our tools help
ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution. In addition, the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules, coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased in-process variability
which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling.

With our broad portfolio of application-focused technologies and our
dedicated yield technology expertise, we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ next-generation products, including those required for the 32nm chip generation and beyond.



Our Process Control and Yield Acceleration Solutions

Accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of high-performance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing. Ramping to
high-volume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an IC manufacturer realizes for a given product. KLA-Tencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer, reticle and IC
manufacturing processes, but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems. The ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers
to improve control over their manufacturing processes. This allows them to increase their yield of high-performance parts and deliver their products to market ahead of their competitors—thus maximizing their profit.

Products

KLA-Tencor operates in one reportable
segment for the design, manufacture and marketing of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. We design, market, manufacture and sell our equipment—consisting of patterned and
unpatterned wafer inspection, defect review and classification; reticle defect inspection; packaging and interconnect inspection; critical dimension metrology; pattern overlay metrology; film thickness, surface topography and composition
measurement; measurement of in-chamber process conditions, wafer shape and stress metrology; computational lithography tools; and overall yield and fab-wide data management and analysis. We also currently offer products that serve the LED, data
storage, solar and other industries.

In September 2008, KLA-Tencor completed its acquisition of the Microelectronic Inspection Equipment
business unit (“MIE business unit”) of Vistec Semiconductor Systems. Based in Weilburg, Germany, the MIE business unit provides advanced semiconductor mask and wafer inspection and metrology systems. The MIE business unit complements our
product portfolio and provides an opportunity for growth into new segments of the mask and wafer markets. The MIE mask metrology tools include registration metrology (pattern placement) tools and scanning electron microscopy (“SEM”)-based
tools for mask critical dimension measurements. Other MIE technologies include macro defect-inspection systems, optical review tools and overlay-measurement systems for micro-electromechanical systems (“MEMS”) applications.

KLA-Tencor’s offerings can be broadly categorized into the following groups: Chip Manufacturing, Wafer Manufacturing, Reticle Manufacturing, Data
Storage Media/Head Manufacturing, Solar Manufacturing, High Brightness LED Manufacturing, Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing, MEMS Manufacturing and General Purpose/Lab Applications. For our customers manufacturing larger design-rule devices, we
provide refurbished KLA-Tencor Certified tools along with service and support.

Chip Manufacturing

KLA-Tencor’s comprehensive portfolio of defect inspection, review, metrology, in-situ process monitoring and lithography modeling tools help chip
manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication process—from research and development to final volume production. These products and solutions are designed to help fabs accelerate their development and production ramp cycles, to
achieve higher and more stable semiconductor die yields, and to improve overall profitability.

Front-End Defect Inspection

KLA-Tencor’s front-end defect inspection tools cover a broad range of yield applications within the IC
manufacturing environment, including incoming wafer qualification, reticle qualification, research and development, and tool, process and line monitoring. Patterned and unpatterned wafer inspectors find particles, pattern defects and electrical
issues on the front surface, back surface and edge of the wafer,



allowing engineers to detect and monitor critical yield excursions. Fabs rely on our high sensitivity reticle inspection systems to identify defects in
reticles at an early stage, to prevent reticle defects from printing on production wafers. The defect data generated by our inspectors is compiled and reduced to relevant root-cause and yield-analysis information with our suite of data management
tools. By implementing our front-end defect inspection and analysis systems, chipmakers are able to take quick corrective action, resulting in faster yield improvement and better time to market.

In fiscal year 2009, we launched five front-end defect inspection products that help accelerate yield for 45nm and
32nm design node devices. The 2820

TM

Series systems are high-productivity
brightfield patterned wafer inspectors, utilizing full-spectrum deep ultraviolet (“DUV”)/ultraviolet (“UV”)/visible illumination, unique optical modes, and an improved data rate to capture a broad range of defect types in the
lithography cell and other process modules throughout the fab. The XP

TM

upgrade
option provides a cost-effective means to extend the performance of the 2810

TM

Series and 2820 Series brightfield inspectors by integrating design-aware inspection capability and recipe acceleration features. The eS35

TM

electron-beam inspection system is our tenth-generation e-beam inspector, enabling the identification of yield, reliability and
performance issues by providing the capture and classification of buried electrical and small physical defects. The Surfscan

®

SP2

XP

unpatterned wafer surface inspection system delivers high throughput for
process tool monitoring throughout the fab and a high sensitivity operating mode to accelerate development of next-generation devices. Improvements in the Klarity

®

Defect automated defect analysis module and data management system enable the analysis of edge inspection defect data, the rapid analysis of large sets of defect
data, and faster identification of defect excursions by comparing the spatial distribution of defect clusters with known patterns of defectivity.

The products that we launched during fiscal year 2009 further strengthened our broad range of offerings that support
the front-end defect inspection market. For patterned wafer inspection, for example, we offer our 2367

TM

, 2810 Series and 2820 Series systems (for broadband brightfield optical defect inspection); our Puma

TM

9100 Series systems (for laser-based darkfield optical defect inspection); and our eS32

TM

and eS35 systems (for e-beam defect inspection). In the field of unpatterned wafer and surface inspection, our
primary offering is our Surfscan SP Series (a series of wafer defect inspection systems for process tool qualification and monitoring using blanket films and bare wafers), to which our SURFmonitor

TM

module may be added to enable capture of low-contrast defects. For reticle inspection, we offer our TeraFab

TM

products, which are photomask inspection systems that allow IC fabs to qualify incoming
reticles and inspect production reticles for contaminants. In addition, we offer a number of other products for the front-end defect inspection market, as reflected in the product table at the conclusion of this “Products” section.

Back-End Defect Inspection

KLA-Tencor, through its ICOS division, offers a series of standalone inspection systems for various applications in the field of semiconductor packaging (i.e., at the back-end of the semiconductor manufacturing
process). Our Component Inspector (“CI”) products inspect various semiconductor components that are handled in a tray, such as microprocessors or memory chips. Component inspection capability includes 3D coplanarity inspection, measurement
of the evenness of the contacts, and 2D surface inspection. Our Wafer Inspector (“WI”) products inspect either undiced wafers, or diced wafers mounted on film frame carriers. They inspect the surface quality of the wafers, the quality of
the wafer cutting, or wafer bumps.

Defect Review

KLA-Tencor’s defect review systems capture high resolution images of the defects detected by inspection tools. These images enable
defect classification, helping chipmakers to identify and resolve yield issues. Our complete line of defect review and classification tools spans optical and electron-beam technologies, from bench-top research systems to production-worthy tools
having full factory automation.



KLA-Tencor’s suite of defect inspectors, defect review and classification tools and data management systems form a comprehensive solution for finding,
identifying and tracking yield-critical defects and process issues.

Metrology

Metrology is a critical discipline in the production of high performance, reliable devices. Whether verifying that a design will be
manufacturable, characterizing a new process, or monitoring high-volume manufacturing processes, our comprehensive set of metrology, analysis and process window optimization products gives IC manufacturers the ability to maintain tight control of
their processes.

In May 2009, we collaborated with Tokyo Electron Limited to jointly introduce AcuShape

TM

, a new modeling and library-generation package to meet optical critical dimension
metrology requirements for the 32nm node and below. This new software package enables metrology engineers in IC fabs to measure the dimensions of 3D logic and memory structures, such as FinFETs, bulb RCATs, and structures created by advanced
patterning techniques such as spacer pitch splitting and double-patterning lithography.

In-Situ Process Monitoring

KLA-Tencor’s SensArray

®

SensorWafers

TM

series provides a unique way, not available from conventional equipment monitors, to capture the effect of the process environment on production wafers. Measurements, such as temperature and radio frequency
(“RF”) voltage, are used by both chipmakers and process equipment manufacturers to visualize, diagnose and control their processes and process tools.

During fiscal year 2009, we launched two new in-situ process monitoring tools. The PlasmaVolt

TM

X2, for measurement of plasma chamber conditions, offers an increased number of embedded
sensors and improved spatial resolution and is highly sensitive to changes in various parameters such as RF power, gas flows, magnetic fields and chamber design. The EtchTemp

TM

SensorWafer captures the effect of the process environment on production wafers and offers unique new capabilities to robustly
characterize the high-power, high-frequency etch recipes proliferating at 65nm nodes and below.

Lithography Modeling

Researchers at advanced IC manufacturers, stepper companies, track companies and material providers use virtual
lithography software to explore critical-feature designs, manufacturability and process-limited yield of proposed lithographic technologies without the time and expense of printing hundreds of test wafers using experimental materials and prototype
process equipment. Our PROLITH

TM

product line provides uniquely rigorous tools to
enable researchers to model the local interactions of light with the mask, patterning materials and processes, to predict the outcome of the pattern on the wafer. During fiscal year 2009, we launched both PROLITH 11 and PROLITH 12, which enable
modeling of double-patterning lithography, a method for constructing the small features of advanced devices by dividing the pattern into two interleaved patterns, and Extreme Ultra-Violet (“EUV”) lithography systems, respectively.

Wafer Manufacturing

KLA-Tencor’s
wafer manufacturing tools include inspection, metrology and data management systems. Specialized inspection tools assess surface quality and detect, count and bin defects during the wafer manufacturing process and as a critical part of outgoing
inspection. Wafer geometry tools ensure the wafer is extremely flat and uniform in thickness, with precisely controlled surface topography. Specifications for wafer defectivity, geometry and surface quality are tightening as the dimensions of
transistors become so small that the properties of the substrate can substantially affect transistor performance.

Key products in the
wafer manufacturing field include our Surfscan SP series systems, which offer defect and surface quality inspection for polished wafers, epi wafers and engineered substrates, as well as



SURFmonitor, an optional module for Surfscan SP2 and Surfscan SP2

XP

systems that performs both surface and defect inspection (by monitoring process drift and capturing low-contrast defects) as well
as wafer geometry and nanotopography metrology (by indicating sub-Angstrom surface topography variation on bare substrates). Other products that we offer for the wafer manufacturing market are highlighted in the product table at the conclusion of
this “Products” section.

Reticle Manufacturing

Error-free reticles, or masks, are the first step in achieving high semiconductor device yields, since reticle defects can be replicated on production wafers. KLA-Tencor offers high sensitivity reticle inspection and
metrology systems for mask shops, helping them manufacture reticles that are free of any relevant defects and meet mask metrology requirements. The reticle inspection systems use optical imaging and multiple inspection modes to find numerous types
of reticle defects prior to printing on the wafer. The metrology systems enable quality reticle manufacturing by providing outstanding precision for reticle pattern placement and accurate measurement of reticles’ critical dimensions.

In September 2008, we launched the die-to-database version of Wafer Plane Inspection (“WPI”), our latest
mask inspection technology that allows leading-edge logic and foundry mask makers to concurrently detect defects on the mask and assess whether the defects are likely to print on the wafer. This was followed in April 2009 with the launch of the
TeraScan

TM

XR, a reticle inspection system that utilizes high-resolution reticle-,
aerial- and wafer-plane inspection capability to provide mask manufacturers better sensitivity, lower cost-per-inspection and faster mask dispositioning.

These new reticle manufacturing products extend the performance of our existing reticle inspection portfolio, which includes our
photomask defect inspection systems TeraScan (for mask shop production of advanced-node reticles) and TeraStar

TM

(for larger design-rule devices). Other products that we offer for the reticle manufacturing market are highlighted in the product table at the conclusion of this “Products” section.

Data Storage Media/Head Manufacturing

Growth in data
storage is being driven by a wave of innovative consumer electronics with small form factors and immense storage capacities. Our process control and yield management solutions are designed to enable customers to rapidly understand and resolve
complex manufacturing problems, which can help improve time to market and increased product yields. In the front-end and back-end of thin-film head wafer manufacturing, we offer the same process control equipment with which we serve the
semiconductor industry. In addition, we offer an extensive range of test equipment and surface profilers with particular strength in photolithography and magnetics control. In substrate and media manufacturing, we offer metrology and defect
inspection solutions with KLA-Tencor’s optical surface analyzers and magneto-optical mappers.

Solar Manufacturing

Photovoltaic or “solar” cells are used to produce electrical power from light. The continuing growth of the solar industry is closely related to
the production cost of solar cells, as economic viability increases with lowering prices. To address our customers’ needs in this important industry, KLA-Tencor offers both surface profilers and solar wafer and cell inspection modules which are
integrated in different stages of the solar wafer and cell production lines to increase yield and lower production costs.

In July 2008, we launched the P-6

TM

system which provides stylus profiling
and analysis of surface topography, for issues such as roughness, film stress and curvature, in an economical benchtop design for samples up to 150mm. This was followed in March 2009 with the launch of the ICOS

®

PVI-6

TM

inspection module—designed for high speed, automated, optical in-line inspection of both the front surface and back surface of monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar wafers and cells, as well as the fast and
reliable optical classification of solar cells at the final stage of the production flow.



High Brightness LED Manufacturing

High brightness LED (“HB-LED”) usage is increasing for new applications as manufacturing costs decrease and their
performance improves. Applications such as mobile phone liquid crystal display (“LCD”) screens and camera phone keypads and flashlights of HB-LEDs have been the drivers for market growth in the last couple of years, as well as car
headlights, LCD TV backlights and traffic signals. HB-LEDs typically are used for high-end applications, making quality control imperative. Our ICOS wafer inspector offers outgoing automated visual inspection of HB-LED wafers for quality of the
wafer surface. Candela

TM

®

Optical Surface Analyzer technology is being used by industry leaders in the LED manufacturing industry to monitor production lines, identify mission critical defects
of interest, and create process-specific recipes to detect and classify killer defects while ignoring nuisance defects.

Compound Semiconductor
Manufacturing

With tighter design limits and the escalating need to increase yield and reduce costs, automated defect inspection in
compound semiconductor manufacturing is becoming increasingly more critical. KLA-Tencor’s Candela inspection tool combines the elemental principles of scatterometry, ellipsometry, reflectometry and topographical analysis to detect and classify
defects in substrates, epi-layers and process films. Candela technology is being used by industry leaders in LED, single-crystalline thin film, silicon carbide and semiconductor industries to monitor production lines, identify mission critical
defects of interest, and create process-specific recipes to detect and classify killer defects while ignoring nuisance defects.

MEMS Manufacturing

The increasing demand for MEMS technology is coming from diverse industries such as automotive, space and consumer electronics. MEMS has
the potential to revolutionize nearly every product category by bringing together silicon-based microelectronics with micromachining technology, making possible the realization of complete systems-on-a-chip. KLA-Tencor offers the tools and
techniques, first developed for the integrated circuit industry, for this emerging market.

General Purpose/Lab Applications

A range of industries, including general scientific and materials research, optoelectronics and data storage, require measurements of surface topography
to either control their processes or research new material characteristics. Typical measurement parameters that our tools address include flatness, roughness, curvature, peak-to-valley, asperity, waviness, texture, volume, sphericity, slope,
density, stress, bearing ratio and distance (mainly in the micron to nanometer range).

Customers

To support our growing global customer base, we maintain a significant presence throughout the United States, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Japan, staffed with local sales and applications engineers, customer and field service engineers and
yield management consultants. We count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers from each of these regions. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, two customers, Intel Corporation and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.,
accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. In each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.

Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand
for ICs and products utilizing ICs. We do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature, but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers, and it is impacted by the investment
patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets. Downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.

Sales, Service and Marketing

Our sales, service and
marketing efforts are aimed at building long-term relationships with our customers. We focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services. Customers benefit from
the simplified planning and coordination, as well as the increased equipment compatibility that are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier. Our revenues are derived primarily from product sales, mostly through our direct sales force.

We believe that the size and location of our field sales, service and applications engineering, and marketing organizations represent a
competitive advantage in our served markets. We have direct sales forces in the United States, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Japan. We maintain an export compliance program that is designed to fully meet the requirements of the United States Departments
of Commerce and State.

As of June 30, 2009, we employed approximately 2,050 sales and related personnel, service engineers and
applications engineers. In addition to sales and service offices in the United States, we conduct sales, marketing and services out of wholly-owned subsidiaries or branches in other countries, including Belgium, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong,
India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom. International revenues accounted for approximately 76%, 79% and 76% of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. Additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in Note 17, “Segment Reporting and Geographic Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We believe that sales outside the United States will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues. Our future performance
will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to compete successfully in Asia, one of the largest markets for our equipment. Our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between
countries in the region and the United States, and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region.

International sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, restrictions on export technology, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and the
difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations. In addition, international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country. The revenues from our international business may also be affected by
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in non-dollar product sales through hedging activities, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate. These factors could have
a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.



Backlog

Our backlog for system shipments and associated warranty totaled $332 million and $715 million as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and includes sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is
anticipated within the next 12 months. We make backlog adjustments for backlog obtained from acquired companies, cancellations, customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments. Orders for service contracts and unreleased products are
excluded from backlog. All orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, often with limited or no penalties.

Because
customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders, and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual
sales for any succeeding periods. Our backlog is not subject to our normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements. The concept of backlog is not defined in the accounting
literature, making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading.

Research and Development

The market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation. These
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. We believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain
our competitive position. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs. As part of
our customer relationships, we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby our customers offset certain of our research and development costs. As of June 30, 2009, we employed approximately 1,150 research and
development personnel.

Our key research and development activities during fiscal year 2009 involved development of process control and
yield management equipment for sub-65nm processing. For information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years, including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs, see Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry, we are committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development. New product introductions may contribute to
fluctuations in operating results, since customers may defer ordering existing products. If new products have reliability or quality problems, those problems may result in reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and
payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products, or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace. If we do not
successfully introduce new products, our results of operations will be adversely affected.

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies

We perform system design, assembly and testing in-house and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies. Our
in-house manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through third-party vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products. Our principal manufacturing
activities take place in San Jose and Milpitas, California, with additional significant operations in Israel, Singapore, Belgium, Germany and China. As of June 30, 2009, we employed approximately 700 manufacturing personnel.



Many of the parts, components and subassemblies (collectively “parts”) that we use are standard
commercial products, although certain parts are made to our specifications. We use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts are available from
multiple suppliers, this is not always possible and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by selecting and
qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts, by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers, and by ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain manufacturing schedules.

Although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources
could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers, damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Competition

The worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive. In each of our
product markets, we face competition from established and potential competitors, some of which may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have, such as Applied Materials, Inc. and Hitachi
Electronics Engineering Co., Ltd. We may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and
processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics. We believe that to remain competitive, we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain
customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process research and development.

Significant competitive
factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, installed base and technical service and support. We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive
factors, the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity.

Management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services. However, any loss of
competitive position could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues, gross margins and market share, any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.

Acquisitions and Alliances

We continuously evaluate
strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations,
technologies and products of the acquired companies, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. The inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Additional
information regarding our business combination during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 can be found in Note 5, “Business Combinations” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Patents and Other Proprietary Rights

We protect our
proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws, including patent, copyright and trade secret. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the United States and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the
legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws. In addition, from time to time we acquire license rights under United States and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.



Although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business, due to the
rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry, we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise,
continuing development of new systems, market penetration, installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide.

No assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications, that license assignments will be made as anticipated, or that our patents, licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently
broad to protect our technology. No assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage. In
addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology.

Employees

As of June 30, 2009, we employed
approximately 4,900 people. None of our employees are represented by a labor union; however, our employees in France (pursuant to French industrial relations law) and in the German operations of our acquired MIE business unit are represented by
employee work councils. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.

Competition is intense in
the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management, marketing and technical employees.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

A description of factors that could
materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is provided below.

Risks Associated with Our Industry and Market Conditions

The semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical. The purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the
economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide. If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.

The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of the
industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity, which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization, consumer demand for products,
inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital. This cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue, and in some cases, future expense levels. In the current environment, our ability to accurately predict our future
operating results is particularly limited. During down cycles in our industry, the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted, which could result not only in a decrease in, or cancellation or delay of, orders (which are generally
subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty) but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers. When
cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During periods of declining
revenues, as was experienced during fiscal year 2009, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees. If we fail to respond, or if our
attempts to respond (such as the global workforce reductions and cost-reduction efforts that we announced in November 2008 and March 2009) fail to accomplish our intended results, then our business could be seriously harmed. Furthermore, any
workforce reductions and cost-reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges, disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be
able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand. We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles. Each of these factors could adversely impact our operating
results and financial condition.

In addition, the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly
developing and changing over time. These changes currently, or in the future may, include the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers’ investment decisions; the
variability of future growth rates in the semiconductor and related industries; the ever-increasing cost and complexity involved in the adoption by our customers of technology advances and the potential impact that may have on their rate of
adoption; pricing trends in the end-markets for consumer electronics and other products, which places a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership; overall changes in capital spending patterns by our customers; and demand by
semiconductor manufacturers for shorter cycle times for developing, manufacturing and installing capital equipment. If we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries, our business,
financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted.

We are exposed to risks associated with the current weakened
condition of the financial markets and the global economy.

The recent severe tightening of the credit markets, turmoil in the
financial markets and weakening of the global economy have contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate, which slowdowns are likely to worsen if these economic conditions are prolonged or deteriorate further.



The markets for semiconductors, and therefore our business, are ultimately driven by the global demand
for electronic devices by consumers and businesses. Economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending, which, in the recent economic slowdown, has caused our customers to decrease, cancel or delay their equipment and
service orders from us. In addition, the recent tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit have made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of
capital equipment, including the products we sell. Reduced demand, combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing (or the unavailability of such financing), has adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues
and therefore has harmed our business and operating results, and our operating results and financial condition may be further adversely impacted if the current economic conditions persist.

In addition, a further decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments.
Our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities, auction rate securities, money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments. Although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due
to the quality and (where applicable) credit ratings and government guarantees of the underlying investments, a further decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market values of our investments and their liquidity. If
the market value of such investments were to decline, or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions, we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales, either of
which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

If we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to
changes resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide.

Our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research,
engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support capabilities than we possess. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services, some of which compete with the products and
services that we offer. These competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products, including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings. In addition, we face
competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive
position could negatively affect our prices, customer orders, revenues, gross margins and market share, any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.

We have recorded significant restructuring, inventory write-off and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future, which
could have a material negative impact on our business.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we recorded material
restructuring charges of $38.7 million related to our global workforce reduction, large excess inventory write-offs of $85.6 million, and material impairment charges of $446.7 million related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets. If the
current challenging economic conditions persist, we may implement additional cost-reduction actions, which would require us to take additional, potentially material, restructuring charges related to, among other things, employee terminations or exit
costs. We may also be required to write off additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory experience further declines, and such additional write-offs could constitute material charges.

As noted above, we recorded a material charge during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased
intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is instead tested for



impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

. Purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 144,

Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. The valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows,
market multiples, and discount rates. A substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to
calculate the amount of such impairment charge, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge.

Any such additional material charges, whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment, may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial
statements.

We are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.

Our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, historically has been, and is becoming increasingly, highly concentrated. In this
environment, orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of our sales. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer,
may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders, or they delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business. Furthermore, because our products are configured to customer
specifications, any changes, delays or cancellations of orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that
are less favorable to us. Also, certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes, experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities, any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer
relationships and transactions. In the current challenging economic environment, we are exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers. For instance, during the fiscal year ended June 30,
2009, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $23.2 million from $12.3 million at June 30, 2008 for potential losses relating to a heightened risk of non-payment of accounts receivable by customers facing financial difficulty. To
the extent our customers experience liquidity issues, we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers. In addition, customers with liquidity issues may be forced to discontinue
operations or may be acquired by one of our customers, and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
operating results.

A majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the United States, and we expect that international
revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue. A protracted economic slowdown in any of the countries in which we do business may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

A majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the United States, and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a
substantial percentage of our revenue. Our international revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each country and region. Because of our significant dependence on international revenue, a decline in the economies of
any of the countries or regions in which we do business could negatively affect our operating results. Managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with, among other things, cultural diversity and
organizational alignment. Moreover, each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period. Periodic local or
international economic downturns, trade balance issues, tariffs or other trade barriers, political instability, legal or regulatory changes or terrorism in regions where we have operations or where we do business, along with fluctuations in interest
and currency exchange rates, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Although we attempt to manage near-term currency risks through the use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate.



Risks Related to Our Business

If we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed.

Success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new
solutions. For example, the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes. While we expect these trends will increase our customers’
reliance on diagnostic products such as ours, we cannot be sure that these trends will directly improve our business. These and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue
older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support. Technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees. Our competitive advantage and future business
success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards, to develop and introduce new products that successfully address changing customer needs, to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new
products in a timely and cost-effective manner.

In this environment, we must continue to make significant investments in research and
development in order to enhance the performance, features and functionality of our products, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands. Substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm
the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to
recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements. In addition, we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are
favorable to us. Our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products.

Our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.

We use a wide range of materials in the production of our products, including custom electronic and mechanical components, and we
use numerous suppliers to supply these materials. We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders, we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials
for manufacturing. We seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts, monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and
maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. In addition, if
certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations, which is a heightened risk during the current economic downturn, that would affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our
products. Our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements, or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms.

Disruption of our manufacturing facilities due to earthquake, flood, other natural catastrophic events or terrorism could result in cancellation of
orders or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business.

We have significant manufacturing operations in the United
States, with additional operations in Israel, Singapore, Belgium, Germany and China. Operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of
war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. Such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers. We cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major
disruption were to occur or that, if it were available, it could be obtained on favorable terms.



As part of the cost-cutting actions that we have recently announced, we are currently in the process of
consolidating several of our operating facilities. During fiscal year 2009 and in previous years, our operations in California have been distributed among several locations, including Milpitas, San Jose, Fremont and Santa Clara. However, upon
completion of our current consolidation efforts, our California operations will be primarily centralized in our Milpitas facility. The consolidation of our California operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any
of the disruptive events described in the preceding paragraph, such as acts of war or terrorism, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters, if any such event were to impact our Milpitas facility.

We outsource a number of services to third-party service providers, which decreases our control over the performance of these functions.
Disruptions or delays at our third-party service providers could adversely impact our operations.

We outsource a number of
services, including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts, to domestic and overseas third-party service providers. While outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations, they also reduce our direct control over the
services rendered. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered, or our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions. Disruptions or delays at our
third-party service providers due to events such as regional economic, business, environmental or political events, information technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact our operations and our ability to ship products,
manage our product inventory or record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.

Our success
is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. If we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology, we may lose valuable assets.

Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. We own various United States and international patents and have
additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued
patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies and obtain patents
relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own, adversely affecting our business. In addition, we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and
suppliers, and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects. The termination of any such collaboration, or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated
challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration, could significantly impair our research and development efforts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.

We also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation.
However, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.

While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel. We
attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. We also maintain exclusive and
non-exclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products. However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. In addition, the
laws of certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In any event, the extent to which we can protect our trade
secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited, and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors.



We might be involved in intellectual property disputes or other intellectual property infringement
claims that may be costly to resolve, prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.

As is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry, from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual
property rights which they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. In addition, we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to
intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties. Litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose
or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms. Our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate. However, we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or, if
obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. The inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms, or the instigation of litigation or other
administrative proceedings, could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.

We depend on key personnel to manage
our business effectively, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our key employees, our sales and product development could be harmed.

Our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and other employees are difficult to replace. We generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees. Further, we do not
maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. The expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain key personnel, or if we are not able to
attract, assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future, our business and operations could be harmed.

Acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but, because of the uncertainties involved, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses. We are
also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter.

In addition to our efforts to develop new
technologies from internal sources, part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources. As part of this effort, we may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with
complementary products, services and/or technologies. There can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful. In addition, we may use equity to finance future acquisitions,
which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current shareholders.

If we are unable to successfully integrate
and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly, then our business and financial results may suffer. It is possible that the businesses we have acquired, as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future, may perform
worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected. In addition, we may lose key employees of the acquired companies. As a result, risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material
adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons, including:

•

we may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses;

•

the combination of businesses may cause the loss of key personnel or an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our company and/or the acquired
business;

•

we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions;

•

we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products;



•

we may face difficulties in coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;

•

the customers, suppliers, employees and others with whom the companies we acquire have business dealings may have a potentially adverse reaction to the acquisition;

•

we may have to write-off goodwill or other intangible assets; and

•

we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions.

At times, we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers, suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and
intellectual property. These alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary, highly sensitive information. The success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no
control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

Compliance with federal securities laws, rules and
regulations, as well as NASDAQ requirements, is becoming increasingly complex, and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business.

Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as NASDAQ rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance
measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive
officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations. These laws, rules and regulations have increased, and in the future are expected to continue to increase, the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance,
reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations.

We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war. If international political instability continues or increases, our business and results of operations could be harmed.

The threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets. Any
act of terrorism which affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business. Increased international political instability in various parts of the world, disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security
measures as a result of terrorist attacks, may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations. Such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable,
increase our insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to fluctuate. This same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products. If international political instability
continues or increases, our business and results of operations could be harmed. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war.

We self insure certain risks including earthquake risk. If one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.

We purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks; however, certain other risks are uninsurable
or are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance. An earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, most of which are conducted in California, an area highly susceptible to earthquakes. It could
also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products, most of which are also conducted in California. We take steps to minimize the damage that would



be caused by an earthquake, but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake. We self insure earthquake risks
because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market. Certain other risks are also self-insured either based on a similar
cost-benefit analysis, or based on the unavailability of insurance. If one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.

A change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices (or changes in interpretations of such standards, practices or rules) can have a significant effect on our
reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective.

New accounting
pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to (or revised interpretations of) existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning
of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

For example, the
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment,

which required us to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method beginning in fiscal year 2006 and record such expense in our consolidated financial
statements, has had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

A change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business.

A number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and
taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses
not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes
in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (for example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, such as the recent proposal by President Obama’s Administration, if enacted); changes in generally accepted accounting
principles; and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. A change in our effective tax rate can adversely impact our results from operations.

We are exposed to various risks related to the legal and regulatory environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business.

We are subject to various risks related to compliance with new, existing, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules
and regulations enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply, including environmental, safety, antitrust and export control regulations. For example, we are subject to
environmental and safety regulations in connection with our global business operations, including regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of our products, recycling and disposal of materials used in our products or in producing
our products, the operation of our facilities, and the use of our real property. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws, rules or regulations, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations, including changes that result
in inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules or regulations, in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our reported financial results or our ability to conduct
our business.

In addition, we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment, contracts, product
performance, product liability, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, unfair competition and other matters (in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters, which are separately discussed elsewhere in this
Item 1A). These legal proceedings and claims, regardless of



their merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend, divert management’s attention and resources, and/or inhibit our ability to sell
our products. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims, which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and our ability to operate our business.

We are also exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments
and government agencies, both domestically and internationally. Under the terms of these government grants, the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur, directly and indirectly, in connection with such
programs. Any such audit could result in modifications to, or even termination of, the applicable government funding program. For example, if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program, those costs
would not be reimbursed, and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded. We do not know the outcome of any future audits. Any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties (financial or
otherwise), termination of funding programs, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency, any of which could adversely impact our operating
results, financial condition and our ability to operate our business.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
although we hedge certain currency risks, we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries.

We have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro and the Japanese Yen. We have international subsidiaries
that operate and sell our products globally. We routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with various financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may
be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations. To the extent that these hedges are inadequate, or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place, our
reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a financial counter-party to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency
hedge, we may experience material financial losses.

We are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to
receivables factoring and banking arrangements.

We enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of
our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions, any of which may prove not to be financially viable. If we were to stop
entering into these factoring arrangements, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables. However, by entering into these arrangements, and by engaging
these financial institutions for banking services, we are exposed to additional risks. If any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements, we
may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds, any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

There are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness.

As of June 30, 2009, we had $750 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness represented by our senior notes that will mature in 2018, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the
future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other risk factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
manage any of these risks successfully. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities.



In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of our
senior notes, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We cannot make any assurance that we
will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the senior notes. Our ability to repurchase the senior notes in such event may be limited by law, by the indenture associated
with the senior notes, or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time. If we fail to repurchase the senior notes as required by the indenture, it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the
senior notes which, in turn, may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations.

We are exposed to fluctuations
in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings. In addition, we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock.

Our investment portfolio consists of both corporate and government securities that have a maximum effective maturity of 10 years.
The longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. We have the
ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity. Unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and bond yields.

Auction rate securities backed by student loans which are collateralized, insured and guaranteed by the United States Federal Department of Education are also included in our investment portfolio. Due to the current illiquidity in the
auction rate security market, the funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. Although
we believe our auction rate securities continue to represent sound investments due to the AAA/Aaa credit ratings of the underlying investments, we may be forced to sell some of our auction rate securities portfolio under illiquid market conditions,
which could result in our recognizing a loss on such sales.

In August 2008, UBS AG entered into a settlement in principle with the SEC and
various state regulatory agencies to restore liquidity to all clients holding auction rate securities. Per the settlement, UBS has agreed to offer certain clients the option to redeem all of their auction rate securities at par, no loss, from UBS
between June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2012, and we formally accepted this offer and entered into a repurchase agreement with UBS on November 11, 2008. However, UBS has expressly disclaimed any assurance that it will have enough financial
resources necessary to perform its obligations under the agreement. If we elect to retain our auction rate securities in reliance upon that offer, with the intent of participating in the offer, but UBS is unable to satisfy its obligations under the
offer at the applicable time, we may be required to sell the auction rate securities at that time at a significant loss or hold the auction rate securities until they may be sold, which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results and
financial condition.

In addition, the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years.
The trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors, including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate,
fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets, our operating results or other performance metrics, or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A. Volatility in the market
price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common
stock as consideration to acquire other companies.



We are exposed to risks related to our indemnification of third parties and the performance of our
products.

From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual
relationships, including customers and lessors, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or
covenants, other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. We may be compelled to enter into or
accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes. In addition, notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our
liability that we seek to include in our business agreements, the counter-parties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions, and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor, any of
which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings. It is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations, whether or not
asserted, due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim. Our business, financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal
period could be materially adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims, regardless of their merit or outcomes.

We are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues. Our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects, especially
when products are first introduced. Unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us, including increased service or warranty costs, providing product replacements for (or modifications to) defective
products, litigation related to defective products, product recalls, or product write-offs or disposal costs. These costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business, financial condition and operating results. In
addition, our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects, which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business.

We rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operation. Our inability to use or access these information systems at
critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations.

Our global operations
are linked by information systems, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, network communications, email and various computer hardware and software applications. Despite our implementation of network security measures,
our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites, or could be subject to system failures or malfunctions for other
reasons. Any such event could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

We may experience
difficulties with our customer relationship management (“CRM”) system, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system or other IT systems. System failure or malfunctioning may result in a disruption of operations or the inability to
process transactions, and this could adversely affect our financial results

.

We may experience difficulties
with our recently implemented CRM system that could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of our consolidated operations, our financial position and cash flows. System failure or malfunctioning
could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our ERP system or other systems
(whether in connection with the regular operation of such systems or as a result of the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems) could also adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the



evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we encounter unforeseen
problems with regard to our CRM system, ERP system or other systems, our business could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to the Restatement of Our
Prior Financial Results

We have been named as a party to a number of shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits relating to
our historical stock option practices, and we may be named in additional lawsuits in the future. This litigation has been and continues to be time consuming and expensive and could result in the payment of significant judgments and settlements,
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

In connection with our historical
stock option practices and resulting restatements, a number of derivative actions were filed against certain of our current and former directors and officers purporting to assert claims on the Company’s behalf. In addition, a number of
securities class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers seeking damages related to our historical stock option practices and the resulting investigation, inquiries and restatements. There
may be additional lawsuits or other legal proceedings of this nature filed in the future (such as claims by former officers and employees in connection with their stock options, employment terminations and other matters). We cannot predict the
outcome of these lawsuits, nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve these lawsuits. If these lawsuits become time consuming and expensive, or if there are unfavorable outcomes in any of these cases, there
could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our insurance coverage will not cover
our total liabilities and expenses in these lawsuits, in part because we have a significant deductible on certain aspects of the coverage. In addition, subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors,
officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government actions. We currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers, although our
insurance coverage may not be sufficient in some or all of these matters. Furthermore, the insurers may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters, in which case we may have to self-fund all or a substantial portion of our
indemnification obligations.

We are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms
of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered.

In connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other
legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices, we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws, such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. If we
were to violate any such law, we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation, but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation, which could give rise to additional government actions or other
legal proceedings. Any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses, and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business.
These expenditures and diversions, as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices and the resulting restatements have been time consuming and expensive,
and have had a material adverse effect on us.

The Special Committee investigation and the resulting restatement activities have
required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses. The period of time that will be necessary to resolve these matters is uncertain, and these matters could require significant additional
attention and resources.

PROPERTIES

Information regarding our principal
properties as of June 30, 2009 is set forth below:



(1)

Portions of certain properties are sublet, are vacant and marketed to sublease, or leased to third parties.

(2)

The land on which the Serangoon, Singapore building resides is leased.

(3)

All or portions of certain properties are being made available for sale.

As of June 30, 2009, we owned or leased a total of approximately 2.7 million square feet of space worldwide, including the locations listed above and office space for smaller sales and service offices in
several locations throughout the world. Our operating leases expire at various times through June 30, 2016 with renewal options at the fair market value for additional periods up to five years. Additional information regarding these leases is
incorporated herein by reference from Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our production
facilities have capacity adequate for our current needs, even after giving effect to the sale of certain properties as noted above.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Government Inquiries and SEC Settlement
Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices

On May 23, 2006, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s
Office (“USAO”) requesting information relating to our past stock option grants and related accounting matters. Also on May 23, 2006, we received a letter from the SEC making an informal inquiry and request for information on the same
subject matters. We learned on February 2, 2007 that the SEC had opened a formal investigation into these matters. We cooperated fully with the SEC investigation. On July 25, 2007, we announced that we had reached a settlement with the SEC
by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement resolves completely the SEC investigation into our
historical stock option granting practices. We were not charged by the SEC with fraud, nor were we required to pay any civil penalty, fine or money damages as part of the settlement. On July 31, 2008, the USAO informed us that it had closed its
investigation and had determined not to take any action against us. Both the SEC and USAO investigations with respect to us are now closed.

We have also responded to inquiries from the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”), which conducted an examination of our 401(k) Savings Plan prompted by our stock option issues. We cooperated fully with this examination,
and the DOL has advised us that it has closed its examination with no further action, subject to confirmation of resolution of any potential claims on behalf of our 401(k) Savings Plan in connection with its investments in our stock. We believe
there is no basis for any such claims; however, an independent fiduciary appointed to act in the best interests of our 401(k) Savings Plan has elected to participate in the previously announced settlement of the shareholder class action of all
potential non-ERISA claims (described below), which will involve no additional cost to the Company, and we have agreed to enter into a separate settlement with the independent fiduciary of any and all potential ERISA claims, in which we denied all
liability and paid our 401(k) Savings Plan a total of $25,000. As a result, the DOL examination has been concluded without any material adverse consequence to us. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service conducted an audit covering calendar year
2006 related to our historical stock option practices, which was concluded in July 2008 with a payment by us of $0.1 million. There can be no assurance that other inquiries, investigations or actions will not be started by other United States
federal or state regulatory agencies or by foreign governmental agencies.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option
Practices

Beginning on May 22, 2006, several persons and entities identifying themselves as shareholders of KLA-Tencor filed
derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the Company against several of our current and former directors and officers relating to our accounting for stock options issued from 1994 to the present. The complaints
in these actions allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and other obligations to us and violated state and federal securities laws in connection with our historical stock option granting process, our accounting for
past stock options, and historical sales of stock by the



individual defendants. Three substantially similar actions are pending, one in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the
“Federal Derivative Action,” which consists of three separate lawsuits consolidated into one action); one in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County; and one in the Delaware Chancery Court.

The plaintiffs in the derivative actions have asserted claims for violations of Sections 10(b) (including Rule 10b-5 thereunder), 14(a), and 20(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting such breach, negligence, misappropriation of information, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, breach of
contract, constructive fraud, rescission, and violations of California Corporations Code section 25402, as well as a claim for an accounting of all stock option grants made to the named defendants. KLA-Tencor is named as a nominal defendant in these
actions. On behalf of KLA-Tencor, the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and other relief against the named defendants. The plaintiffs are James Ziolkowski, Mark Ziering, Alaska Electrical Pension Fund, Jeffrey Rabin and Benjamin Langford.
The individual named defendants are current directors and officers Edward W. Barnholt, Robert T. Bond, Stephen P. Kaufman, and Richard P. Wallace; and former directors and officers H. Raymond Bingham, Robert J. Boehlke, Leo Chamberlain,
Gary E. Dickerson, Richard J. Elkus, Jr., Dennis J. Fortino, Jeffrey L. Hall, John H. Kispert, Kenneth Levy, Michael E. Marks, Stuart J. Nichols, Arthur P. Schnitzer, Kenneth L. Schroeder, Jon D. Tompkins, and Lida Urbanek. Current
director David C. Wang and former director Dean O. Morton were originally named as defendants in one of the derivative actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, but were dropped as named defendants
as of December 22, 2006 upon the filing of a consolidated complaint in that action.

The derivative actions are at an early procedural
stage. The defendants are not yet required to respond to the complaints in the actions. Our Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee (“SLC”) composed solely of independent directors to conduct an independent
investigation of the claims asserted in the derivative actions and to determine our position with respect to those claims. On March 25, 2008, the SLC filed a motion to terminate the Federal Derivative Action and to approve certain settlements
with Gary E. Dickerson, Kenneth Levy, Kenneth Schroeder and Jon D. Tompkins related to the claims brought against them in connection with the derivative actions. The Court denied the motion to terminate and to approve the settlements on
December 12, 2008. The SLC filed an appeal and petition for writ of mandate challenging that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which dismissed the appeal on May 8, 2009 and denied the petition for writ
of mandate on July 10, 2009. As a result, the derivative actions remain ongoing. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint in the Federal Derivative Action and will not be required to do so until after the plaintiff has had an
opportunity to amend the complaint. The parties are currently participating in a mediation of the derivative claims in the Federal Derivative Action. No defendant is yet required to answer the complaints in the state court derivative actions in the
California Superior Court for Santa Clara County and the Delaware Chancery Court. Response dates in the California Superior Court action have been stayed until responses are due in the Federal Derivative Action. It is not known whether the
California Superior Court action will remain stayed after that time. On March 17, 2009, the Delaware Chancery Court issued an order staying the Delaware action so that the litigation of the issues can be confined to the prior Federal Derivative
Action. Plaintiff sought leave to appeal the stay decision, which was denied by the Chancery Court on April 14, 2009. Plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court seeking to overturn the Chancery Court’s
denial of the application to appeal, which the Delaware Supreme Court denied on April 27, 2009.

We cannot predict whether these
derivative actions are likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to us.

Shareholder Class Action Litigation Relating to Historical Stock
Option Practices

KLA-Tencor and various of our current and former directors and officers were named as defendants in putative
securities class action filed on June 29, 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Two similar actions were filed later in the same court, and all three cases were consolidated into a



single action. On September 26, 2008, Judge Charles Breyer of the Northern District granted final approval of a settlement resolving all class claims
and dismissing with prejudice all claims brought by the consolidated action. The class action had alleged material misrepresentations in our SEC filings and public statements and brought claims under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,
Section 14(a), Section 20(a), and Section 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a result of the Company’s past stock option grants and related accounting and reporting. The settlement resolved all claims against all
defendants, who were KLA-Tencor, Edward W. Barnholt, H. Raymond Bingham, Robert T. Bond, Gary E. Dickerson, Richard J. Elkus, Jr., Jeffrey L. Hall, Stephen P. Kaufman, John H. Kispert, Kenneth Levy, Michael E. Marks, Stuart J. Nichols, Kenneth L.
Schroeder, Jon D. Tompkins, Lida Urbanek and Richard P. Wallace.

We made a payment of $65.0 million to the settlement class as a term of
the court-approved settlement during the three months ended September 30, 2008, which provides a full release of KLA-Tencor and the other named defendants in connection with the allegations raised in the lawsuit. We had reached an
agreement in principle to resolve the action prior to December 31, 2007, and therefore an amount of $65.0 million was accrued by a charge to selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2007.

Another plaintiff, Chris Crimi, filed a putative class action complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of
Santa Clara on September 4, 2007 against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers. The plaintiff sought to represent a class consisting of persons who held KLA-Tencor common stock between September 20, 2002 and
September 27, 2006, originally alleging causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and rescission based on alleged misstatements and omissions in our SEC filings concerning our past stock option grants, and seeking unspecified damages based
upon purported dilution of our stock, injunctive relief, and rescission. The plaintiff named us, Edward W. Barnholt, H. Raymond Bingham, Robert T. Bond, Richard J. Elkus, Jr., Stephen P. Kaufman, Kenneth Levy, Michael E. Marks, Dean O. Morton,
Kenneth L. Schroeder, Jon D. Tompkins, and Richard P. Wallace as defendants in the action. We filed a demurrer to the complaint, which was sustained, and then removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California upon
plaintiff’s filing an amended complaint. We then filed a motion to dismiss the action in the Northern District of California, which was granted in part, with the remaining claims being remanded back to the California Superior Court on
September 12, 2008. We filed a demurrer to plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint and plaintiff responded by agreeing to dismiss the action with prejudice, bringing an end to this action.

As part of a derivative lawsuit filed in the Delaware Chancery Court on July 21, 2006, a plaintiff claiming to be a KLA-Tencor shareholder also
asserted a separate putative class action claim against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers alleging that shareholders incurred damage due to purported dilution of KLA-Tencor common stock resulting from historical stock
option granting practices. On March 17, 2009, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the putative class action claim and stayed the derivative claims in the action. Plaintiff sought leave to appeal this decision, which the Chancery Court denied
on April 14, 2009. Plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court seeking to overturn the Chancery Court’s denial of the application to appeal, which the Delaware Supreme Court denied on April 27,
2009.

A final judgment has not been entered in the Delaware Chancery Court action, and we cannot predict the final outcome or estimate the
likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse result. However, an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse impact upon the financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome
occurs and in future periods.

Litigation with Former CEO Kenneth Schroeder

On April 17, 2009, Kenneth Schroeder, our former Chief Executive Officer, served us with a lawsuit filed in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara
County asserting various contract and tort claims in connection with our termination of Mr. Schroeder and the cancellation of certain of his stock options and restricted stock units in October 2006. We filed a motion to compel arbitration of Mr.
Schroeder’s claims on June 15, 2009. The



California Superior Court issued an order compelling the arbitration of his claims and staying the state court action on July 27, 2009. We have not yet
responded to Mr. Schroeder’s claims. We deny having any liability and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against all claims asserted by Mr. Schroeder.

At this early stage of the litigation, we cannot predict the final outcome or estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse result. However, an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could have a
material adverse impact upon the financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods.

Indemnification Obligations

Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors,
officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and ongoing government inquiry. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws,
applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in
connection with these matters. We are currently paying or reimbursing legal expenses being incurred in connection with these matters by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. We are also paying defense costs to two
former officers and employees facing SEC civil actions to which we are not a party. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of
this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.

Other Legal Matters

We are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation,
in general, and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation
can be substantial, regardless of outcome. We believe the amounts provided in our financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimated liabilities. However, because such matters are subject to many uncertainties, the ultimate
outcomes are not predictable and there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from the matters described above will not exceed the amounts reflected in our financial statements or will not have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

ITEM 6.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following tables
include selected consolidated summary financial data for each of our last five fiscal years. This data should be read in conjunction with Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1)

In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018.

Effective in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we implemented SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

. It requires us to measure all
employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and
the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results
could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES

The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these
estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of
the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company’s related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial
statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows:

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the seller’s price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare
parts and services. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize
revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer, as follows:

•

When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is
recognized upon shipment.

•

When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred
based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.

•

When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the
required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.

•

When the customer withholds signature on our acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing
as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications.

•

When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer.

Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 14%, 16% and 14% of total
revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 is
primarily driven by lower shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily driven by



increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation, primarily with respect to sales of products of companies that we have acquired during the past
two fiscal years. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues.

Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is
recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.

Spare parts revenue is recognized
when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.

Service
and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Services performed in absence of a contract, such as consulting and training revenue, are recognized when the related services are performed, and
collectability is reasonably assured.

The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced
and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs.

We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with
equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period
commences.

Software is incidental to our products as determined in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (“SOP”)
No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-05,

Applicability of SOP 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software

. We
periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with SOP No. 97-2 and EITF Issue No. 03-05.

Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost, and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net
realizable value. We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis.

We review and set standard costs semi-annually at
current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal
inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges.

We write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic
direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.

Warranty.

We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to
repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses.
Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis.
The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions
as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature



products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. See Note 13, “Commitments and
Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

A
majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial
condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to
assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in
the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional
allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.

Stock-Based Compensation.

Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted
the modified prospective transition method as provided by provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, the fair
value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights
under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. We believe that the
implied volatility is reflective of market conditions. Prior to July 1, 2005, we applied Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

and its related Interpretations and
provided the required pro forma disclosures of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

.

Contingencies and
Litigation.

We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or
settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed
description.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

As required by SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. Purchased technology, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets are presented
at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets

. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible
and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and concluded that the carrying value of our Metrology
reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. Our impairment evaluation of goodwill was based on comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and
requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates and operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. Unanticipated changes in revenue, gross margin, long-term growth factor or
discount rate could result in a material impact on the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second
quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.



Income Taxes.

We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
Income Taxes

, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also
requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of
our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision
in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable.

On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an
estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax
planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results
of operations.

In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations. As a result of the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available
evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is
more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax
law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

We adopted FIN 48 on July 1, 2007. See Note 12, “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.

Valuation of Marketable Securities.

Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized
gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific
identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would
require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its
cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily
impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.

Fair Value Measurements.

We adopted SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, as of the beginning of fiscal year 2009. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) SFAS No. 157-2,
which allows companies to elect a one-year delay in applying SFAS No. 157 to certain fair value measurements, primarily related to nonfinancial instruments. We elected the delayed adoption date for the portions of SFAS No. 157 impacted by
FSP SFAS No. 157-2. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for



measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under SFAS
No. 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under SFAS No. 157 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on
our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Concurrently with our adoption of SFAS No. 157, we adopted SFAS No. 159,

Establishing the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities,

which permits entities to elect, at specified election
dates, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168,

The FASB Accounting
Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles—a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162

. SFAS No. 168 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative
accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
This SFAS is effective for our interim reporting period ending on September 30, 2009. This SFAS is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,

Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)

. SFAS No. 167 changes how a company
determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things,
an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. This SFAS is effective for our interim reporting period ending on
September 30, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 167 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165,

Subsequent Events

. SFAS No. 165 is intended to establish general standards of accounting for
and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This SFAS requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the
basis for that date. The disclosure requirement under this SFAS is effective for our annual reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 141(R)-1,

Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies

. FSP SFAS No. 141(R)-1 will amend
the provisions related to the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination under SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

. The FSP
will carry forward the requirements in SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

, for acquired contingencies, thereby requiring that such contingencies be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably
estimated during the allocation period. Otherwise, entities would typically account for the acquired contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

. The FSP will have the same effective date as SFAS
No. 141(R), and will therefore be effective for our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of FSP SFAS No. 141(R)-1 on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.



In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-4,

Determining Fair Value When the Volume and
Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly

. FSP SFAS No. 157-4 provides guidelines for making fair value measurements more consistent with the principles
presented in SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. The FSP relates to determining fair values when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales. It reaffirms what SFAS No. 157 states is
the objective of fair value measurement—to reflect how much an asset would be sold for in an orderly transaction (as opposed to a distressed or forced transaction) at the date of the financial statements under current market conditions.
Specifically, it reaffirms the need to use judgment to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive. The FSP is effective for our annual reporting for the fiscal year
ended on June 30, 2009. The implementation of FSP SFAS No. 157-4 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1,

Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

. FSP SFAS
No. 107-1 and APB 28-1 enhances consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures. The FSP relates to fair value disclosures for any financial instruments that are not currently reflected on a
company’s balance sheet at fair value. Prior to the effective date of this FSP, fair values for these assets and liabilities have only been disclosed once a year. The FSP will now require these disclosures on a quarterly basis, providing
qualitative and quantitative information about fair value estimates for all those financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value. The disclosure requirement under this FSP is effective for our interim reporting period ending
on September 30, 2009.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 115-2 and SFAS No. 124-2,

Recognition and
Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

. FSP SFAS No. 115-2 and SFAS No. 124-2 provides additional guidance designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting and presenting impairment losses on securities. The
FSP is intended to bring greater consistency to the timing of impairment recognition, and provide greater clarity to investors about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold. The measure of
impairment in comprehensive income remains fair value. The FSP also requires increased and more timely disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses, and an aging of securities with unrealized losses. The FSP is effective for our annual
reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009. The implementation of FSP SFAS No. 115-2 and SFAS No. 124-2 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 132(R)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets.

FSP SFAS
No. 132(R)-1 amends SFAS No. 132(R) to provide guidance on an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The FSP requires disclosures surrounding how investment allocation
decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies. The disclosure requirement under this FSP is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not
Active.

FSP SFAS No. 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, which we adopted as of July 1, 2008, in situations where the market for a particular financial asset is not active. We have considered the guidance provided by
FSP SFAS No. 157-3 in its determination of estimated fair values, and the impact was not material.

On August 27, 2008, the SEC
announced that they will issue for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by U.S. issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). IFRS is a comprehensive
series of accounting standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board. Under the proposed roadmap, we could be required in fiscal year 2014 to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The SEC is expected to make a
determination in



2011 regarding the mandatory adoption of IFRS. We are currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our consolidated financial
statements, and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of IFRS.

In April 2008, the FASB adopted FSP
SFAS No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

, amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under
SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. This FSP is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of FSP SFAS No. 142-3 on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February 2008, the FASB adopted FSP SFAS No. 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,

delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of the deferred portion of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007),

Business Combinations

. SFAS No. 141(R) retains the
fundamental requirements of the original pronouncement requiring that the purchase method be used for all business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business
combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair values as of the acquisition
date. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) requires expensing of acquisition-related and restructure-related costs, remeasurement of earn-out provisions at fair value, measurement of equity securities issued for purchase at the date of close of the
transaction and non-expensing of in-process research and development related intangibles. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009, except that resolution of
certain tax contingencies and adjustments to valuation allowances related to business combinations, which previously were adjusted to goodwill, will be adjusted to income tax expense for all such adjustments after July 1, 2009, regardless of
the date of the original business combination. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB
No. 51

. This SFAS amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the
amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. This SFAS establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation. SFAS No. 160
is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. This SFAS is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

KLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Within our primary area of focus, our comprehensive
portfolio of products, services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire wafer fabrication process – from research and development to final volume
production. In addition to the semiconductor industry, our technologies serve a number of other industries, including light emitting diode (“LED”), data storage, solar process development and control, and general materials research.

Our products and services are used by virtually every major wafer, IC and photomask manufacturer in the world. Our revenues are driven
largely by capital spending by our customers who operate in one or more of several key semiconductor markets, including the memory, foundry and logic markets. Our customers purchase our products either in response to the need to drive advances in
process technologies or to ramp up production to satisfy demand from industries such as communication, data processing, consumer electronics, automotive and aerospace. We believe that, over the long-term, our customers will continue to invest in
advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as reduced cost, which in turn will drive increased adoption of process control to reduce defectivity.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of
which can be difficult to predict. The industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity. We expect our customers’ technology-related capital spending on process control (as
differentiated from capacity-related capital spending) to increase over the long term, as technology spending is driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of
device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. However, our ability to predict future capacity-related capital spending by our customers is more
limited, as such spending is more closely connected to the unpredictable business cycles within their industries.

The demand for our
products is generally affected by the profitability of our customers, which is driven by capacity and market supply for their products. While semiconductor content in communication, data processing, consumer electronics, automotive and aerospace
products continues to increase, the global economic weakness has adversely impacted our customers that operate in those industries. During the recent economic downturn, the demand for our products has been adversely affected by lower profitability
of our customers, especially in the memory market, as well as the weak macroeconomic and credit environment and its overall impact on capital spending.

Our results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 reflect the impact of the global economic downturn and the resulting contraction in near-term demand for semiconductor and nanoelectronic manufacturing
equipment. Several of our customers have reduced their expenditures for production equipment in response to declining sales of their end products and resulting reductions in the utilization of existing manufacturing capacity. Although some customers
continue to invest in equipment that is critical to technology development, capacity-related purchases have dropped to historically low levels. This decline was also a result of difficulty experienced by some customers in obtaining financing for
their capital expenditure plans. We expect demand for semiconductor capital equipment to continue to remain weak until macroeconomic conditions improve. We cannot predict the severity or duration of the global economic downturn, or the resulting
impact on our customer base or on our customers’ manufacturing strategies. However, as long as such conditions persist, we expect that our product order levels and revenues will remain depressed.

We have taken significant steps to reduce our production levels and operating cost structure in alignment with expected near-term order and revenue
levels. We have lowered our production volumes in response to anticipated near-term business levels in an effort to size our operations to expected demand levels. However, our reduced scale of operations has led to increased inventory-related
charges (as our manufacturing inventory



requirements decline) and reduced manufacturing capacity utilization, which has adversely impacted our results of operations. Declines in factory utilization
by our customers have also resulted in lower service revenue levels and additional inventory-related charges (due to the related decline in customer usage of our systems). During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we announced global
workforce reductions and other cost-reduction efforts aimed at lowering our operating expenses in response to the demand environment, and we continue to evaluate further cost-reduction activities as well as the need to further adjust production
levels in the event that business conditions deteriorate further. These activities, if implemented, will result in additional near-term charges. However, we believe that our cost-reduction efforts, combined with our strategy and our ability to
innovate and execute, will enable us to strengthen our relative competitive position in the current difficult business environment, and will put us in position to take advantage of long-term growth opportunities when favorable business conditions
emerge.

We continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution
capabilities. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we completed the acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Microelectronic Inspection
Equipment business unit (“MIE business unit”) of Vistec Semiconductor Systems. The acquired MIE business unit is a provider of mask registration measurement tools, SEM-based tools for mask critical dimension measurement and macro defect
inspection systems. The results of operations of the MIE business unit are included in the following table from the date of the acquisition on September 30, 2008.

The following table sets forth some of our key quarterly unaudited financial information:

Revenues and Gross Margin

Product revenues

Product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as a result of a reduction in capital spending by our customers due to the recent weakness in
the semiconductor industry and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, which have resulted in customers delaying their purchases and installations of our products. The decline in revenues reflects the slowdown in worldwide demand for
semiconductor equipment, as semiconductor manufacturers reduce capital spending and conserve cash in response to their business environment, even as their need for more precise diagnostics capabilities increases with technological advances. The weak
macroeconomic and credit environments have adversely impacted the profitability of our customers, their access to capital and their capital spending and are likely to result in product revenues in the near term that are lower than our revenue levels
in comparable periods during prior fiscal years.

Product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as many of our customers, primarily in the memory markets, scaled back on their capacity investments as the market for their products weakened. In addition, as the macroeconomic environment deteriorated towards
the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, semiconductor companies reduced their capital spending, which resulted in lower revenues for our products compared to those for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, two customers, Intel Corporation and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., accounted for more than 10% of total
revenues. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, two customers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and
Intel Corporation, accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable.

Service revenues

Service revenues are generated from
maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post-warranty
systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems. Service revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as customers idled their under-utilized
production equipment in response to the recent weakness in the semiconductor industry and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. Service revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2007 as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow.



Revenues by region

Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):

A significant portion of our revenues continue to be generated in Asia, where a substantial
portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that will continue to be the case.

Gross margin

Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product and revenue mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to
manufacturing and servicing our products. Our gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 due to lower product and service revenues, higher intangible assets
amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit, decreased manufacturing capacity utilization, and excess inventory write-downs, which were partially offset by lower employee-related expenses as a result of a
number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken. The following are costs that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008:

•

$290.9 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $375.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008,

•

$85.6 million charge for excess inventory write-downs, compared to $42.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and

•

$48.2 million for amortization of intangibles, compared to $30.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.

The decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was primarily due to
$21.4 million of inventory write-downs related to disposal of service inventory as well as discontinued products in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The following are costs that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008
compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007:

•

$375.2 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $396.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, and

•

$30.3 million for amortization of intangibles, compared to $33.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.



Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”)

R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 decreased compared to the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease is primarily attributable to reduced employee-related expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken, as well as reduced engineering material costs due to a reduced
number of projects during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. These decreases were partially offset by additional R&D spending as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit. The following are expenses that were recorded
in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008:

•

$220.8 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $226.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008,

•

$97.9 million for engineering material costs, compared to $112.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008,

•

$31.6 million for outside services such as consulting and legal, compared to $36.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008,

•

$31.1 million for depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangibles and expensed in-process R&D (“IPR&D”), compared to $47.4 million
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and

•

$21.7 million of benefit to R&D expense from external funding, compared to $20.4 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.

The decrease in R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2007 is primarily attributable to lower stock-based compensation expense due to our transition from granting stock options to our employees to granting restricted stock units, which carry with them lower stock-based compensation
expense. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007:

•

$226.5 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $254.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007,

•

$112.7 million for engineering material costs, compared to $104.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007,

•

$36.8 million for outside services such as consulting and legal, compared to $33.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, and

•

$20.4 million of benefit to R&D expense from external funding, compared to $12.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we expensed IPR&D of $8.6 million, $22.7 million
and $16.6 million, respectively, upon the completion of the acquisitions during the applicable fiscal year in connection with acquired intellectual property for which, as of the acquisition date, technological feasibility had not been established
and no future alternative uses existed. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking
into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. We determined a discount rate for each



project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological
change in the project and the industry, among other factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk
due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into
commercially viable products consists primarily of planning, designing, experimenting, and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we determined that we would not pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed to us
during fiscal year 2006 for approximately $14.0 million. Since we did not have any alternative use for these patents and we believe the fair value to be $0, the carrying value of $10.7 million was written off. The write-off was recorded as $10.0
million to R&D expense and $0.7 million to costs of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

R&D expenses include the
benefit of $21.7 million, $20.4 million and $12.7 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We
expect our R&D expenses to increase with increases in our business activity levels as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products.

Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our
marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers
face at future technology nodes.

Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”)

SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were lower compared to the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to lower expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices and reduced employee-related expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities
that we have undertaken, which are partially offset by additional SG&A spending and higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit, additional bad debt expense and lower gain on
sale of real estate assets. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008:

•

$328.0 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $378.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008,

•

$23.2 million for bad debt expense, compared to $0.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008,

•

$59.2 million for depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles, compared to $34.3 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008,



•

$13.9 million for expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices, compared to $76.9 million during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2008, and

•

$4.1 million in net gains recorded on the sale of real estate assets, compared to $20.1 million recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.

The decrease in SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2007 is primarily attributable to gains recognized on sale of our certain real estate assets, lower severance and benefits related to employee workforce reductions, lower stock-based compensation expense and improvements in our
operational efficiency. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007:

•

$378.2 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $408.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007,

•

$76.9 million for expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices, compared to $14.7 million during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2007,

•

$1.9 million for fixed asset impairment charges, compared to $56.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, and

•

$20.1 million in net gains recorded on the sale of real estate assets, compared to no such gain recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

In November 2006, as part of our long-term business plan, we decided to sell certain real estate properties that we
owned in San Jose, California and Livermore, California. Based on the valuation of these assets, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $56.8 million, which has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. See Note 18, “Sale and Impairment of Real Estate Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

On October 16, 2006, following the Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices, we terminated all aspects of our
employment relationship and agreement with Kenneth L. Schroeder, who ceased to be our Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2006 and had thereafter been employed as a Senior Advisor. As a result, vesting of Mr. Schroeder’s then
outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 0.9 million unvested option shares and 0.1 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the time of termination were
canceled. Accordingly, in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we reversed $20.3 million of the non-cash, stock-based compensation charges in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 43 of SFAS No. 123(R), because
Mr. Schroeder would no longer be able to fulfill his service obligations. The $20.3 million reversal related to the charges that had been recorded in prior periods related to unvested option shares and restricted stock award shares.

In December 2006, we canceled 0.6 million vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the time of termination, representing those
shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. In accordance with paragraph 57 of SFAS No. 123(R), previously recognized stock-based compensation expense related to these awards was not reversed upon cancellation.

Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

For the three months ended December 31, 2008, we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit and concluded that the carrying value of our Metrology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair
value. As a result of the global economic downturn, reductions to our revenue and operating forecasts, and a significant reduction in our market capitalization, we determined that the goodwill related to our Metrology reporting unit was fully
impaired. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $272.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2008.



As a result of the aforementioned impairment indicators and in accordance with SFAS No. 144, we also
performed an analysis utilizing discounted future cash flows related to the long-lived and intangible assets to determine the fair value of each of our asset groups. Based on the assessment, we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of
$162.8 million related to existing technology, patents, customer relationships and trademarks, as well as an additional $2.0 million related to long-lived assets, during the three months ended December 31, 2008. There have been no significant
events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill or purchased intangible assets subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.

Restructuring Charges

In March 2009, we announced a
plan to further reduce our global workforce by approximately 10%, which followed our announcement in November 2008 of a global workforce reduction of approximately 15%. We are undertaking a number of cost reduction activities, including these
workforce reductions, in an effort to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate in response to the current demand environment. The program in the United States is accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112,

Employers’ Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits—an amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statements No. 5 and 43,

whereas the programs in our international locations are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
Contingencies

. We expect to recognize significant cost savings from a number of activities we have recently undertaken, including estimated annual cost savings of approximately $130 million as a result of the November 2008 and March 2009
workforce reductions. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we recorded a $38.7 million net restructuring charge, of which $15.9 million was recorded to costs of revenues, $8.6 million to engineering, research and development expense and
$14.2 million to selling, general and administrative expense. These charges represent the estimated minimum liability associated with expected termination benefits to be provided to employees. In addition, we are currently in the process of
evaluating additional restructuring activities which, if implemented, may result in additional restructuring charges.

The following table
shows the activity primarily related to severance and benefits expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009:

Substantially all of the restructuring charges related to our workforce reductions announced in
November 2008 and March 2009 are expected to be paid out during the calendar year ending December 31, 2009.

Interest Income and Other, Net



Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and
cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, as well as gains or losses recorded upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The decrease in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was primarily due to lower interest income from our investment and cash portfolio as well as lower foreign currency transaction gain. The decrease in interest income and other,
net in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily due to the lower interest income earned on lower average cash balances during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

The increases in interest expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2008 as well as for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 were primarily due to additional interest expense as a result of the issuance of $750 million aggregate
principal amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax provision was 13.1%, 35.9% and 22.2% in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Our effective rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 included the effect of $276.6 million of goodwill impairment charges, which are
non-deductible for tax purposes. In addition, we recognized an expense of $38.1 million related to the effect of the New California Budget Legislation signed on February 20, 2009, which will allow for a taxpayer to elect an alternative method
to attribute taxable income to California for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to make the election to use the alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2012.
The expense included a reduction in non-current deferred tax assets of $9.7 million and a $28.4 million valuation allowance on excess California research and development credits that we believe will not be utilized due to the effect of the lower
apportionment rate.

Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 included $52.9 million of incremental U.S. tax
expense associated with the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy. The incremental U.S. tax expense was a result of an inter-company licensing agreement related to the migration of manufacturing to Singapore. That increase in our U.S.
tax expense was partially offset by a benefit of $14.4 million that we recognized during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 resulting from revising the amount of prior year cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered
to be permanently reinvested outside the United States.

Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 included a
reduction in tax expense of $15.3 million resulting from the reduction in tax reserves primarily due to the resolution of an examination by the State of California for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 to June 30, 1999, receipt by the
Company of a federal tax refund for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation’s confirmation of the Internal Revenue Service’s audit findings related to the fiscal year ended June 30,
2003.

Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, R&D tax credits,
state taxes and tax audit settlements. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, non tax-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions,
research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.

Windfall tax benefits arise when a company’s tax deductions for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded
as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are recorded as decreases to



capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are
recorded as provision for income taxes.

At June 30, 2009, we had cumulative windfalls in excess of shortfalls of approximately $6.0
million recorded as part of capital in excess of par value. In our fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, we expect cumulative shortfalls will begin to exceed cumulative windfalls since the adoption date of SFAS No. 123, and we will therefore
report higher provision for income taxes as a result. Because we can not determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, we cannot currently estimate this impact on
our tax rate for the next fiscal year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At June 30, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion,
a decrease of $249.5 million from June 30, 2008. We generated $195.7 million in cash from operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. We used $484.9 million in cash for investing activities and an additional $299.1 million for
financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.

We have historically financed our operations through cash generated
from operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $195.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 consisted primarily of net loss of $523.4
million, offset by goodwill, purchased intangible asset and long-lived asset impairment charges of $452.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $135.8 million, non-cash stock-based compensation of $105.5 million, a decrease in inventories of
$120.2 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $277.3 million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. These increases in operating cash flow
were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $432.5 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.

Cash
provided by operating activities was $662.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 consisted primarily of net income of $359.1 million, increased by
depreciation and amortization of $126.4 million, non-cash stock-based compensation of $106.5 million, a decrease in inventories of $100.2 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $149.3
million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. These increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $183.7 million in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2008.



Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 consisted primarily of
net income of $528.1 million increased by depreciation and amortization of $109.3 million, non-cash stock-based compensation of $99.6 million and non-cash impairment charges of $67.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of
$107.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $45.6 million, and changes in other assets and liabilities of $32.8 million.

Investing
activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of capital assets to support long-term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging
technologies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we paid $141.4 million for acquisition of the MIE business unit completed during the fiscal year. Also, sales of certain real estate assets during the fiscal year ended June 30,
2009 generated $21.8 million, which was offset by capital expenditures of $22.2 million.

Financing activities include dividend payments to
our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock. Issuances of common stock (net of applicable tax withholding payment) provided $27.9 million, $155.6 million and $263.2 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively. We used $226.5 million, $1,111.2 million and $808.5 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we announced plans to reduce our global workforce by approximately 15% and 10% in November 2008 and
March 2009, respectively. We expect to recognize estimated annual cost savings of $130 million as a result of these reductions in workforce. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we recorded a $38.7 million net restructuring charge, of
which $31.9 million was paid out as of June 30, 2009, and the remaining balance is expected to be paid out by the end of calendar year 2009. We anticipate incurring additional severance costs and other related expense in connection with the
workforce reductions at least through the remainder of calendar year 2009.

The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $102.1 million, $108.5 million and $95.1 million, respectively.

In February 2007, we entered
into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program with a third-party investment bank and prepaid $750.0 million to repurchase our common stock. The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the ASR was determined
and adjusted based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during a period following the execution of the ASR agreement, subject to a maximum price per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we
repurchased 14.0 million shares of our common stock under the ASR, of which 2.0 million shares were delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

The shares repurchased under the ASR decreased our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. This decrease was partially offset by
additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In October 2008, we suspended our stock repurchase program.



Contractual Obligations

The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2009:

(1)

In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018.

(2)

Represents the non-current income tax payable obligation under FIN 48. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12
months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.

We have agreements with financial institutions to sell
certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment for goods.

The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid during
the years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

(1)

Discounting fees were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest income and other, net.

We maintain guarantee arrangements of $29.1 million in various locations to fund customs guarantees for VAT and LC needs of our subsidiaries in Europe
and Asia. Approximately $18.9 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of June 30, 2009.

We maintain certain purchase
commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This
forecast time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. We estimate our purchase commitments as of June 30, 2009 to be approximately $74.4 million, most of which is due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the
volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential
cancellation penalties.



We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing
labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product
performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be
larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates.
Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed
description.

Working capital decreased to $1.8 billion as of June 30, 2009, compared to $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2008. This
decrease is primarily due to cash payments for the share repurchase program, cash payments of dividends to stockholders and an acquisition in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 offset by cash generated from operations. As of June 30,
2009, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others
of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from
operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities, which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years. They are typically issued in the form of municipal bonds, preferred stock,
a pool of student loans, or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset. The reset typically occurs every seven to forty-nine days, through an auction process. At the end of each reset period, investors can sell or continue to
hold the securities at par. The auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans and are collateralized, insured and guaranteed by the United States Federal Department of Education. In addition, all auction rate securities held by us
are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either AAA or Aaa. In February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $48.2 million in par value of municipal auction rate securities that we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. These
failures are not believed to be a credit issue, but rather caused by a lack of liquidity. The funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found
outside of the auction process, or the security matures. Prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, a total of $4.8 million of the auction rate securities with a net book value of $4.6 million were called at par by the issuer; therefore, no
losses were recognized on these securities. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, an additional $2.8 million of the auction rate securities were called at par by the issuer; therefore, no losses were recognized on these securities during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The fair value of our auction rate securities at June 30, 2009 was $38.2 million, which is included in marketable securities under current assets, as our intention is to exercise our right with UBS AG
(“UBS”) to sell these auction rate securities at par value at the earliest date possible, which is June 30, 2010.

By letter
dated August 8, 2008, we received notification from UBS, in connection with a settlement entered into between UBS and certain regulatory agencies, offering to repurchase all of our auction rate security holdings at par value. We formally
accepted the settlement offer and entered into a repurchase agreement (“Agreement”) with UBS on November 11, 2008 (“Acceptance Date”). By accepting the Agreement, we (1) received the right (“Put Option”) to
sell our auction rate securities at par value to UBS between June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2012 and (2) gave UBS the right to purchase the auction rate securities from us any time after the Acceptance Date as long as we receive the par
value.

We expect to sell the auction rate securities under the Put Option. However, if the Put Option is not exercised before
June 30, 2012, it will expire, and UBS will have no further rights or obligation to buy the auction rate securities.



UBS’s obligations under the Put Option are not secured by its assets and do not require UBS to
obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the Put Option. UBS has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the Put Option.

The Agreement covers $40.7 million par value (fair value of $38.2 million) of the auction rate securities held by us as of June 30, 2009. We are
accounting for the Put Option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option of SFAS No. 159 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. As a result, $2.4 million was recorded as an
increase to interest income and other, net for the fair value of the Put Option during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The fair value of the Put Option at June 30, 2009 was $2.4 million.

During the three months ended December 31, 2008, we made an election pursuant to SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities

, to transfer these auction rate securities from available-for-sale to trading securities. The transfer to trading securities reflects our intent to exercise the Put Option during the period June 30, 2010 to
June 30, 2012. Prior to entering into the Agreement, our intent was to hold the auction rate securities until the market recovered. At the time of transfer, the unrealized loss on the auction rate securities was $1.3
million. Prior to the transfer, this unrealized loss had been included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Upon transfer of the auction rate securities to trading securities during the three months ended December 31,
2008, we immediately recognized an unrealized loss of $1.3 million, included in interest income and other, net, for the amount of the unrealized loss not previously recognized in earnings. Subsequently, we recognized an additional decline in
fair value of $5.4 million for a total unrealized loss of $6.7 million, included in interest income and other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 31, 2008. During the three months ended
March 31, 2009, we recognized an increase in the fair value of the auction rate securities of $4.9 million, which is included in interest income and other, net. During the three months ended June 30, 2009, we recognized a decrease in the
fair value of the auction rate securities of $0.7 million, which is included in interest income and other, net.

We expect that the future
changes in the fair value of the Put Option will continue to be largely offset by the fair value movements in the auction rate securities. We estimated the fair value of the auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model incorporating
assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Some of these assumptions include estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate securities. We
estimated the fair value of the Put Option using the expected value that we will receive from UBS, which was calculated as the difference between the anticipated recognized losses and par value of the auction rate securities as of the option
exercise date. This value was discounted by using UBS’s credit default swap rate to account for the credit considerations of the counterparty risk. We will reassess the fair value in future reporting periods based on several factors, including
continued failure of auctions, failure of investments to be redeemed, deterioration of credit ratings of investments, market risk and other factors. Based on our expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash, we do not believe that any
reduction in liquidity of our auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs.

In
April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior, unsecured long-term debt due in 2018 with an effective interest rate of 7.00%. The discount on the debt amounted to $5.4 million and is being amortized over the life of
the debt using the straight-line method as opposed to the interest method due to immateriality. Interest is payable semi-annually on November 1 and May 1. The debt indenture includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our
facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. We are in compliance with all of our covenants as at June 30, 2009.



Our credit ratings and outlooks as of July 23, 2009 are summarized below.

Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the
economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Under our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to
protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign
currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge
contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows:



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign
currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2009. Actual
results may differ materially.

As of June 30, 2009, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $804.9 million,
excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase
immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2009, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $2.0 million.

See Note 4, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements; Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources”; and Item 1A, “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at
June 30, 2009.

As of June 30, 2009, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $69.1 million in foreign currency in order
to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts
on June 30, 2009, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $69.7 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $17.5 million. However, if this occurred,
the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency
exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows.

In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal
amount of 6.90% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and
decrease as interest rates rise. At June 30, 2009, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $745.2 million and $702.0 million, respectively. At June 30, 2008, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt
were $744.7 million and $728.9 million, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE
1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Operations and Principles of Consolidation.

KLA-Tencor
Corporation (“KLA-Tencor” or the “Company”) is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Headquartered in Milpitas, California, KLA-Tencor
has subsidiaries both in the United States and in key markets throughout the world.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of KLA-Tencor and its majority-owned subsidiaries, and the ownership interests of minority investors are recorded as minority interests. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company has evaluated
material subsequent events through August 6, 2009, the date these financial statements were issued.

Management Estimates.

The
preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

KLA-Tencor has evaluated the estimated fair value of financial instruments using available market information
and valuations as provided by third-party sources. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The fair value of KLA-Tencor’s cash, cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these items.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities.

All highly liquid debt instruments with original or remaining maturities of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
Marketable securities are generally classified as available-for-sale for use in current operations if required and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, presented as a separate component of stockholders’
equity under the caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” All realized gains and losses and unrealized losses resulting from declines in fair value that are other than temporary are recorded in earnings in the period of
occurrence. The specific identification method is used to determine the realized gains and losses on investments.

Non-Marketable Equity
Securities and Other Investments.

KLA-Tencor acquires certain equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives, and to the extent these investments continue to have strategic value, KLA-Tencor typically does not attempt
to reduce or eliminate the inherent market risks. Non-marketable equity securities and other investments are recorded at historical cost. Non-marketable equity securities and other investments are included in “Other non-current assets” on
the balance sheet. Non-marketable equity securities are subject to a periodic impairment review; however, there are no open-market valuations, and the impairment analysis requires significant judgment. This analysis includes assessment of the
investee’s financial condition, the business outlook for its products and technology, its projected results and cash flow, the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences
held by KLA-Tencor or others.

Variable Interest Entities.

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
No. (“FIN”) 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51

, requires that if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of
operations of the variable interest entity should be included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. KLA-Tencor has



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

concluded that none of the Company’s equity investments are material to the Company’s financial position and do not require consolidation as they
are either not variable interest entities or, in the event they are variable interest entities, KLA-Tencor is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.

Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost, and reserves are recorded to state the
demonstration units at their net realizable value. KLA-Tencor reviews the adequacy of its inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. The Company reviews and sets standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate
actual costs. The Company’s manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle
facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges. The Company writes down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on
past usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from
forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

A
majority of the Company’s trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon the Company’s assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts
is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are
recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally thirty to thirty-five years for buildings, ten to
fifteen years for leasehold improvements, five to seven years for furniture and fixtures, and two to five years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method over the shorter of the life of the related
asset or the term of the underlying lease. Construction in process does not depreciate until the assets are placed in service. Depreciation expense for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $54.7 million, $60.6 million and
$58.3 million, respectively.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. Purchased
technology, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment
under SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over
the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. The Company conducted its annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and concluded
that the carrying value of the Company’s Metrology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The Company’s impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates and operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others.
Unanticipated changes in revenue, gross margin, long-term growth factor or discount rate could result in a



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

material impact on the estimated fair values of the Company’s reporting units. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the
valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

KLA-Tencor evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset including disposition, is less
than the carrying value of the asset. Such an impairment charge would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.

Software Development Costs.

KLA-Tencor capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire and create internal use software in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (“SOP”)
No. 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

. Capitalized software is included in property and equipment when development is complete and is depreciated over three to five years when
placed in service.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

Financial instruments that potentially subject KLA-Tencor to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term and non-current marketable securities, trade accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities. KLA-Tencor invests in a variety of
financial instruments, such as, but not limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate and municipal bonds, United States Treasury and agency securities, and equity securities and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one
financial institution or commercial issuer. KLA-Tencor has not experienced any material credit losses on its investments.

A majority of
KLA-Tencor’s trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers located throughout the world, with a majority located in Asia. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is considered
to be limited due to the Company’s customer base and the diversity of its geographic sales areas. KLA-Tencor performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral to secure accounts
receivable. KLA-Tencor maintains an allowance for potential credit losses based upon expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. In addition, KLA-Tencor may utilize letters of credit or non-recourse factoring to mitigate credit risk when
considered appropriate.

KLA-Tencor is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the foreign exchange
contracts that the Company uses in hedging activities and in certain factoring transactions. These counterparties are large international financial institutions, and to date no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations under
such contracts.

Foreign Currency.

The functional currencies of KLA-Tencor’s foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies,
except as described below. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars at current period end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates
in effect during the period. The gains and losses from foreign currency translation of these subsidiaries’ financial statements are recorded directly into a separate component of stockholders’ equity under the caption “Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss).”

KLA-Tencor’s manufacturing subsidiaries in Germany, Israel and Singapore use the U.S. dollar
as their functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, except for non-monetary assets, such as inventories and property, plant and equipment
that are translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs are translated using average



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting
translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.

Derivative Financial
Instruments.

KLA-Tencor uses financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and currency options, to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within twelve
months. The purpose of KLA-Tencor’s foreign currency program is to manage the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The effect of exchange rate changes on forward
exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items. KLA-Tencor believes these financial instruments do not subject the Company to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in
currency exchange rates. KLA-Tencor does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

All of
KLA-Tencor’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency
denominated transactions, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged
transaction affects earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments
used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or loss on these hedges is recorded immediately in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

Warranty.

KLA-Tencor provides standard warranty coverage on its systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts
necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. KLA-Tencor accounts for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and
field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, KLA-Tencor calculates the average service hours and parts expense per system and applies the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. KLA-Tencor updates these
estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases KLA-Tencor adjusts its warranty accruals accordingly (see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies”).

Revenue Recognition.

KLA-Tencor recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, the seller’s price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. KLA-Tencor derives revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. KLA-Tencor typically recognizes
revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. Under certain circumstances, however, KLA-Tencor recognizes revenue prior to written acceptance
from the customer, as follows:

•

When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is
recognized on shipment.

•

When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred
based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.

•

When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the
required acceptance criteria upon shipment,



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is
recognized upon completion of the installation.

•

When the customer withholds signature on the acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing
as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications.

•

When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer.

Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 14%, 16% and 14% of total
revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 is
primarily driven by lower shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily driven by increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation, primarily with respect to sales of products of companies that the Company has acquired during the past two fiscal years. Shipping
charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues.

KLA-Tencor
also allows for multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales contract are not delivered and accepted at the same time. In such cases, KLA-Tencor defers the relative fair value of the undelivered element until that
element is delivered to the customer. To be considered a separate element, the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting and fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer
on a standalone basis; (b) there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item(s); and (c) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of
the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company. If the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the
customer.

Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. The Company
estimates the value of the trade-in right and reduces the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.

Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable
is probable.

Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. If maintenance is
included in an arrangement, that includes a software license agreement, amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value. Services performed in absence of a contract, such as consulting and
training revenue, are recognized when the related services are performed, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

The deferred system
profit balance as of June 30, 2009 and 2008 was $95.8 million and $150.8 million, respectively, and equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs.

KLA-Tencor also defers the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services
incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term

period commences. The unearned revenue balance was $69.3 million and $88.4 million as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Software is incidental to the Company’s products as determined in accordance with SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

and
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-05,

Applicability of SOP 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software

. The Company periodically reviews the software element of
its systems in accordance with SOP No. 97-2 and EITF Issue No. 03-05.

Research and Development Costs.

Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred.

Strategic Development Agreements.

Gross engineering, research and development expenses
were partially offset by $21.7 million, $20.4 million and $12.7 million in external funding received under certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Shipping and Handling Costs.

Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans.

The Company accounts for its stock-based awards exchanged for employee services under the
provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly, the fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes
valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. In November 2005, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 123(R)-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Award

s (“FSP 123R-3”). The Company has elected not to adopt the alternative transition method
provided in FSP 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R). The Company followed paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123(R) to calculate the initial pool of excess tax benefits and to
determine the subsequent impact on the Additional Paid-in-Capital pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that were outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The Company
has elected to not include the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and recognizes the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event
occurs.

Advertising Expenses.

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $2.3 million, $4.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively.

Income Taxes.

KLA-Tencor accounts
for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax
bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has
determined that its future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of its deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in the Company’s ability to recover its deferred tax assets, the Company could be required to record a
valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to the Company’s tax provision in the period in which the Company determined that the recovery was not probable.

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, on July 1, 2007. FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax
positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of
a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

Earnings Per Share.

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is
calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by using the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and
restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of stock-based compensation required by SFAS No. 123(R) and SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per
Share

. The dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share when a net loss is recorded for the period as their effect would be anti-dilutive.

Contingencies and Litigation.

The Company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary
to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company
accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 13,
“Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 14, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” for a detailed description.

Reclassifications.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. Starting in fiscal year 2008, interest expense is presented as a separate line item in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations (previously reported as a component of interest income and other, net). Cash flows from trading securities were reclassified from operating to investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,
and purchases and proceeds from sale of trading securities are presented separately (previously reported on a net basis) based on the analysis of the provisions of SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities

. Also, starting in fiscal year 2009, goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment is now presented as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (previously reported as a component of the respective
operating expenses). These reclassifications had no effect on the consolidated operating results or the change in cash and cash equivalents, as previously reported.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168,

The FASB
Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles—a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162

. SFAS No. 168 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of
authoritative accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States. This SFAS is effective for the Company’s interim reporting period ending on September 30, 2009. This SFAS is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations
and cash flows.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,

Amendments to FASB Interpretation
No. 46(R)

. SFAS No. 167 changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a company is
required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. This
SFAS is effective for the Company’s interim reporting period ending on September 30, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 167 on its consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.

In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165,

Subsequent Events

. SFAS No. 165 is intended to
establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This SFAS requires the disclosure of the date through which an
entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. The disclosure requirement under this SFAS is effective for the Company’s annual reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 141(R)-1,

Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise
from Contingencies

. FSP SFAS No. 141(R)-1 will amend the provisions related to the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination
under SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

. The FSP will carry forward the requirements in SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

, for acquired contingencies, thereby requiring that such contingencies be recognized at fair
value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period. Otherwise, entities would typically account for the acquired contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

.
The FSP will have the same effective date as SFAS No. 141(R), and will therefore be effective for the Company’s business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of the implementation of FSP SFAS No. 141(R)-1 on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-4,

Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly

. FSP SFAS
No. 157-4 provides guidelines for making fair value measurements more consistent with the principles presented in SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. The FSP relates to determining fair values when there is no active market or
where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales. It reaffirms what SFAS No. 157 states is the objective of fair value measurement—to reflect how much an asset would be sold for in an orderly transaction (as opposed to a
distressed or forced transaction) at the date of the financial statements under current market conditions. Specifically, it reaffirms the need to use judgment to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair
values when markets have become inactive. The FSP is effective for the Company’s annual reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009. The implementation of FSP SFAS No. 157-4 did not have a material impact on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1,

Interim
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

. FSP SFAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1 enhances consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures. The FSP relates to fair value disclosures for any
financial instruments that are not currently reflected on a company’s balance sheet at fair value. Prior to the effective date of this FSP, fair values for these assets and liabilities have only been disclosed once a year. The FSP will now
require these disclosures on a quarterly basis, providing qualitative and quantitative information about fair value estimates for all those financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value. The disclosure requirement under this
FSP is effective for the Company’s interim reporting period ending on September 30, 2009.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 115-2 and SFAS No. 124-2,

Recognition and
Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

. FSP SFAS No. 115-2 and SFAS No. 124-2 provides additional guidance designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting and presenting impairment losses on securities. The
FSP is intended to bring greater consistency to the timing of impairment recognition, and provide greater clarity to investors about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold. The measure of
impairment in comprehensive income remains fair value. The FSP also requires increased and more timely disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses, and an aging of securities with unrealized losses. The FSP is effective for the
Company’s annual reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009. The implementation of FSP SFAS No. 115-2 and SFAS No. 124-2 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 132(R)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
Assets.

FSP SFAS No. 132(R)-1 amends SFAS No. 132(R) to provide guidance on an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The FSP requires disclosures surrounding how
investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies. The disclosure requirement under this FSP is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
July 1, 2009.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
Market for That Asset is Not Active.

FSP SFAS No. 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, which the Company adopted as of July 1, 2008, in situations where the market for a particular financial asset is not active. The
Company has considered the guidance provided by FSP SFAS No. 157-3 in its determination of estimated fair values, and the impact was not material.

On August 27, 2008, the SEC announced that they will issue for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by U.S. issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). IFRS is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board. Under the proposed roadmap, the Company could be required in fiscal year 2014 to prepare
financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The SEC is expected to make a determination in 2011 regarding the mandatory adoption of IFRS. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on its consolidated
financial statements, and the Company will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of IFRS.

In April 2008, the
FASB adopted FSP SFAS No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

, amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized
intangible asset under SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. This FSP is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of FSP SFAS
No. 142-3 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February 2008, the FASB adopted FSP SFAS
No. 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,

delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of the deferred portion of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007),

Business Combinations

. SFAS No. 141(R) retains
the fundamental requirements of the original pronouncement requiring that the purchase method be used for all business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires
the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) requires expensing of acquisition-related and restructure-related
costs, remeasurement of earn-out provisions at fair value, measurement of equity securities issued for purchase at the date of close of the transaction and non-expensing of in-process research and development related intangibles. SFAS No.
141(R) is effective for our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009, except that resolution of certain tax contingencies and adjustments to valuation allowances related to business combinations, which
previously were adjusted to goodwill, will be adjusted to income tax expense for all such adjustments after July 1, 2009, regardless of the date of the original business combination. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation
of SFAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51

. This SFAS amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the
consolidated financial statements. It requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. This SFAS establishes a single method of accounting for
changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. This SFAS is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

NOTE 2—FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Effective July 1, 2008, the Company adopted the fair value measurement and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements

, which establishes specific criteria for the fair value measurements of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are already subject to fair value measurements under current accounting rules. SFAS No. 157 also
requires expanded disclosures related to fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB approved FSP SFAS No. 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,

which allows companies to elect a one-year delay in applying
SFAS No. 157 to certain fair value measurements, primarily related to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least
annually). The Company elected the delayed adoption date for the portions of SFAS No. 157 impacted by FSP SFAS No. 157-2. The partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 was prospective and has not had a significant effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of applying the deferred portion of SFAS No. 157 to the nonrecurring fair value measurements of its nonfinancial assets and liabilities. In accordance with FSP
SFAS No. 157-2, the fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities will be adopted effective for the Company’s fiscal year ending on June 30, 2010.

Concurrently with the adoption of SFAS No. 157, the Company adopted SFAS No. 159,

Establishing the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Liabilities,

which permits entities to elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. As of March 31, 2009, the Company did not elect the fair value option under SFAS No. 159 for any
financial assets and liabilities that were not previously measured at fair value, with the exception of the Put Option related to the auction rate securities repurchase agreement with UBS AG referenced in Note 4, “Marketable Securities.”



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Fair Value Hierarchy.

SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS No. 157 are described below:

A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level
of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Most of the Company’s financial instruments are classified within
Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. The types of instruments valued based on
quoted market prices in active markets include money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs include U.S. agency securities, commercial paper, U.S. corporate bonds and municipal
obligations. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The principal market in which we
execute our foreign currency contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency. The market participants usually are large commercial banks. Our foreign currency
contracts’ valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment. These contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The types of instruments valued based on unobservable inputs include the auction rate securities held by the Company. Such instruments are
generally classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company estimated the fair value of these auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates
of fair value. Some of these assumptions include estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate securities.

NOTE 4—MARKETABLE SECURITIES

The amortized costs and estimated fair value of marketable securities as of June 30, 2009 and 2008 are as follows:



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

KLA-Tencor’s investment portfolio consists of both corporate and government securities that have
a maximum maturity of 3 years. The longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market
unrealized loss. All unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and bond yields. The Company has the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity. The following table summarizes the fair value and gross
unrealized losses of its investments, aggregated by investment instrument and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2009:

(1)

Of the total gross unrealized losses, there were no amounts that have been in a loss position for 12 months or more.

The contractual maturities of securities classified as available-for-sale as of June 30, 2009, regardless of the consolidated balance sheet
classification, are as follows:

1,122,514

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to
call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Net realized loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was approximately $0.6 million. Net realized gain for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was approximately
$10.2 million, and net realized loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was approximately $1.6 million.

The Company’s
investment portfolio includes auction rate securities, which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years. They are typically issued in the form of municipal bonds, preferred stock, a pool of student loans, or
collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset. The reset typically occurs every seven to forty-nine days, through an auction process. At the end of each reset period, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par. The
auction rate securities held by the Company are backed by student loans and are collateralized, insured and guaranteed by the United States Federal Department of Education. In addition, all auction rate securities held by the Company are rated by
the major independent rating agencies as either AAA or Aaa. In February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $48.2 million in par value of municipal auction rate securities that the Company held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. These
failures are not believed to be a credit issue, but rather caused by a lack of liquidity. The funds



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the
auction process, or the security matures. Prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, a total of $4.8 million of the auction rate securities held by the Company with a net book value of $4.6 million were called at par by the issuer; therefore
no losses were recognized on these securities. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, an additional $2.8 million of the auction rate securities held by the Company was called at par by the issuer; therefore no losses were recognized on
these securities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The fair value of the auction rate securities held by the Company at June 30, 2009 was $38.2 million, which is included in marketable securities under current assets, as the
Company’s intention is to exercise its right with UBS AG (“UBS”) to sell these auction rate securities at par value at the earliest date possible, which is June 30, 2010.

By letter dated August 8, 2008, the Company received notification from UBS, in connection with a settlement entered into between UBS and certain
regulatory agencies, offering to repurchase all of the Company’s auction rate security holdings at par value. The Company formally accepted the settlement offer and entered into a repurchase agreement (“Agreement”) with UBS on
November 11, 2008 (“Acceptance Date”). By accepting the Agreement, the Company (1) received the right (“Put Option”) to sell its auction rate securities at par value to UBS between June 30, 2010 and June 30,
2012 and (2) gave UBS the right to purchase the auction rate securities from the Company any time after the Acceptance Date as long as the Company receives the par value.

The Company expects to sell the auction rate securities under the Put Option. However, if the Put Option is not exercised before June 30, 2012, it
will expire, and UBS will have no further rights or obligation to buy the auction rate securities.

UBS’s obligations under the Put
Option are not secured by its assets and do not require UBS to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the Put Option. UBS has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its
obligations under the Put Option.

The Agreement covers $40.7 million par value (fair value of $38.2 million) of the auction rate
securities held by the Company as of June 30, 2009. The Company is accounting for the Put Option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option of SFAS No. 159 during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2009. As a result, $2.4 million was recorded as an increase to interest income and other, net for the fair value of the Put Option during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The fair value of the Put Option at June 30,
2009 was $2.4 million.

During the three months ended December 31, 2008, the Company made an election pursuant to SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, to transfer these auction rate securities from available-for-sale to trading securities. The transfer to trading securities reflects the Company’s intent to exercise the
Put Option during the period June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012. Prior to entering into the Agreement, the Company’s intent was to hold the auction rate securities until the market recovered. At the time of transfer, the
unrealized loss on the auction rate securities was $1.3 million. Prior to the transfer, this unrealized loss was included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Upon transfer of the auction rate securities to trading securities
during the three months ended December 31, 2008, the Company immediately recognized an unrealized loss of $1.3 million, included in interest income and other, net, for the amount of the unrealized loss not previously recognized in
earnings. Subsequently, the Company recognized an additional decline in fair value of $5.4 million for a total unrealized loss of $6.7 million, included in interest income and other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for
the three months ended December 31, 2008. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company recognized an increase in the fair value of the auction rate securities of



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

$4.9 million, which is included in interest income and other, net. During the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company recognized a decrease in the
fair value of the auction rate securities of $0.7 million, which is included in interest income and other, net.

The Company expects that
the future changes in the fair value of the Put Option will continue to be largely offset by the fair value movements in the auction rate securities. The Company estimated the fair value of the auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow
model incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Some of these assumptions include estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate
securities. The Company estimated the fair value of the Put Option using the expected value that the Company will receive from UBS, which was calculated as the difference between the anticipated recognized losses and par value of the auction rate
securities as of the option exercise date. This value was discounted by using UBS’s credit default swap rate to account for the credit considerations of the counterparty risk. The Company will reassess the fair value in future reporting periods
based on several factors, including continued failure of auctions, failure of investments to be redeemed, deterioration of credit ratings of investments, market risk and other factors. Based on the Company’s expected operating cash flows and
other sources of cash, it does not believe that any reduction in liquidity of its auction rate securities will have a material impact on its overall ability to meet its liquidity needs.

NOTE 5—BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

The Company accounts for business combinations using the purchase

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the Company completed its acquisition of the Microelectronic Inspection Equipment business unit
(“MIE business unit”) of Vistec Semiconductor Systems for net cash consideration of approximately $141.4 million. The acquired MIE business unit is a provider of mask registration measurement tools, scanning electron microscopy
(“SEM”) based tools for mask critical dimension measurement and macro defect inspection systems.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired. The $33.1 million of goodwill is assigned to the defect inspection reporting unit, which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition provides the Company with a line of mask
registration measurement tools to complement the Company’s existing mask inspection products. In addition, through the acquisition the Company has acquired a provider of SEM-based tools for mask critical dimension measurement. Other
technologies of the MIE business unit acquired by the Company in the transaction include macro defect inspection systems, overlay measurement systems for microelectromechanical systems (“MEMS”) applications and software packages for defect
classification and data analysis.

The results of operations of the acquired MIE business unit are included in the accompanying
Consolidated Statement of Operations from the closing date of the acquisition on September 30, 2008. Pro forma earnings information has not been presented because the effect of the acquisition of the MIE business unit is not material to the
Company’s results of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the
Company completed its acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV for net cash consideration of approximately $488.8 million primarily to expand the Company’s product portfolio in semiconductor packaging inspection and to gain entry into
the solar cell inspection and light-emitting diode (“LED”) wafer inspection markets. In addition to the ICOS acquisition, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the Company acquired two development stage companies for a total cash
consideration of $5.5 million, and these acquisitions have been accounted for as a purchase of assets primarily consisting of IPR&D and certain patents. The following table summarizes the aggregate estimated fair values of the net assets
acquired on the date of acquisition of ICOS:

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired. The $287.2 million of goodwill was assigned to the wafer inspection business unit, which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition expands the Company’s capabilities to back-end
markets and provides entry into the potentially high-growth solar market.

The results of operations of ICOS are included in the
accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations from the date of the acquisition of majority control on May 30, 2008. The Company considers the acquisition of

ICOS to be material to its results of operations and therefore is presenting pro forma financial information for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008
and 2007. The pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the merger had taken place at July 1, 2008 or 2007, nor is it
indicative of future operating results.

The following unaudited pro forma information presents a summary of the results of operations of
the Company assuming the acquisition of ICOS occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. The pro forma financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 include the Company’s and ICOS’ historical results for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, including amortization related to fair value adjustments based on the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized as of the ICOS acquisition date of May 30, 2008.

The fair value of the purchased IPR&D and identified intangibles was determined using the
income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included; the utilization of core technology; the complexity, cost and time to
complete development; any alternative future use or current technological feasibility; and the stage of completion. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology,
relevant market sizes and industry trends. The Company determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological
change in the project and the industry, among other factors. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination.

The Company expensed IPR&D of $8.6 million, $22.7 million and $16.6 million upon the completion of the acquisitions in the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in connection with acquired intellectual property for which, as of the acquisition date, technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed.

NOTE 6—GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

The following table presents goodwill
balances and the movements during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008:

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. The carrying value of goodwill was allocated to KLA-Tencor’s reporting units pursuant to SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. In accordance with
SFAS No. 142, the Company completed its annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit for the three months ended December 31, 2008. As a result of the global economic downturn, reductions to the Company’s revenue, operating
income, and cash flow forecasts, and a significant reduction in the Company’s market capitalization, the Company determined that the goodwill related to its Metrology reporting unit was impaired. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment
charge of $272.1 million, which represented the entire goodwill amount related to the Metrology reporting unit, during the three months ended December 31, 2008. The Company’s assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the fair values
of the Company’s Defect Inspection, Service, and Other reporting units exceeded their estimated carrying values and therefore goodwill in those reporting units was not impaired. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting
the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.

Goodwill impairment testing is a two-step process. Step 1 involves comparing the fair value of the Company’s reporting units to their carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there
is no impairment. If the reporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than the fair value, the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Step 2 calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair
value of all tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in Step 1. The implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of
goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. The result of the Company’s analysis indicated that there would be no remaining implied value
attributable to the Metrology reporting unit. Accordingly, the Company wrote off all $272.1 million of goodwill associated with its Metrology reporting unit during the three months ended December 31, 2008.

Fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of two market-based approaches and an income approach, as this combination was deemed to be the
most indicative of the Company’s fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants and is consistent in principle with the methodology used for goodwill evaluation in the prior year. Under the market-based approaches, the Company
utilized information regarding the



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value the Company’s
reporting units. The Company assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow due to the fact that current market conditions are depressed (as compared to the goodwill evaluation performed in fiscal year 2008, when the Company assigned equal
weighting for each of the three approaches). Under the income approach, the Company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the
overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions,
including revenue growth rates and operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others.

Solely for purposes of
establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to goodwill impairment testing, the Company made the following assumptions. The Company assumed that the current economic downturn would continue through fiscal year 2010,
followed by a recovery period in fiscal years 2011 and 2012, and long-term industry growth past fiscal year 2012. In addition, the Company applied gross margin assumptions consistent with the Company’s historical trends at various revenue
levels and used a 5% growth factor to calculate the terminal value of its reporting units, which is consistent with the rate used in the prior year. The Company used a 13% discount rate to calculate the terminal value of its reporting units, which
is slightly lower than the 14% discount rate used in the prior year, primarily due to the fact that in April 2008 the Company issued $750 million of unsecured long-term debt due in 2018, which reduced its weighted average cost of capital. The sum of
the fair values of the reporting units was reconciled to the Company’s current market capitalization (based upon the Company’s stock price) plus an estimated control premium.

Given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the Company’s business, there can be no assurance that the
Company’s estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the recent economic downturn, or the period or strength of recovery, made for purposes of the Company’s goodwill impairment testing during the three months ended
December 31, 2008 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If the Company’s assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or margin growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved, the Company may be required to record
additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with the Company’s next annual impairment testing in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 or prior to that, if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter
during which the annual goodwill impairment test is performed. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.

Adjustments to goodwill during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 resulted primarily from revisions to purchase price allocations related
to entities that were acquired in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as well as foreign currency translation adjustments.

Purchased Intangible Assets

The components of purchased intangible assets as of June 30, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. During the quarter ended December 31, 2008, the economic
conditions that affect the Company’s industry deteriorated, which led our customers to scale back their production operations and reduce their capital expenditures. At that time, industry analysts expected (and continue to expect) demand for
semiconductor capital equipment to continue to remain weak until macroeconomic conditions improve. In addition, the Company experienced a significant decline in its stock price, resulting in a significant reduction in the Company’s market
capitalization. These factors were taken into account as the Company performed an assessment of its purchased intangible assets during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 to test for recoverability in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The
assessment of recoverability is based on management’s estimates. Based on the Company’s assessment for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, undiscounted projected future operating cash flows for certain long-lived asset groups did not
exceed the net book value, indicating that a permanent impairment had occurred. The fair value was determined using the income approach which is a present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flows produced by each asset
group. The Company estimated the future cash flows over the weighted average of the remaining useful lives of its intangible assets, which generally range from 1 to 6 years, using a 13% discount rate. Based on the assessment, the Company recorded an
intangible asset impairment charge of $162.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2008, of which $73.1 million related to existing technology, $26.3 million to patents, $38.1 million to customer relationships, $16.6 million to
trademarks and $8.7 million to other intangible assets. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of purchased intangible assets subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2009.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the Company identified a certain business unit as held for
sale, and, based on the estimated selling price of that business unit, the Company determined that the carrying amount of certain related intangible assets, primarily existing technology, patents and customer relationship, exceeded fair value by
$6.5 million. As a result, an impairment charge of $6.5 million was recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, based on the revised estimated selling price of that business unit, the
Company determined that the carrying amount of certain related net assets further exceeded fair value by $11.9 million. As a result, an additional impairment charge of $11.9 million, of which $4.5 million relates to goodwill impairment and $7.4
million relates to intangible assets impairment, was recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, it was determined that the Company would not pursue
future development of certain patents initially licensed to the Company during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 for approximately $14.0 million. Since the Company did not have any alternative use for these patents and the Company believes
the fair value to be $0, the carrying value of $10.7 million was written off. This write-off was recorded as $10.0 million to R&D expense and $0.7 million to costs of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, amortization expense for other intangible assets was $69.3 million, $55.4 million and $29.4
million, respectively. Based on intangible assets recorded as of June 30, 2009, and assuming no subsequent additions to, or impairment of the underlying assets, the remaining estimated annual amortization expense is expected to be as follows
(in thousands):

NOTE 7—LONG-TERM DEBT

In April 2008, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior, unsecured long-term debt due in 2018 with an effective interest rate of 7.00%. The discount on the debt amounted to $5.4
million and is being amortized over the life of the debt using the straight-line method as opposed to the interest method due to immateriality. Interest is payable semi-annually on November 1 and May 1. The debt indenture includes
covenants that limit the Company’s ability to grant liens on its facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. The Company
was in compliance with all of its covenants as at June 30, 2009.

In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a
downgrade of the rating of the Company’s senior notes, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and
unpaid interest. The Company’s ability to repurchase the senior notes in such event may be limited by law, by the indenture associated with the senior notes by the Company’s then-available financial resources or by the terms of other
agreements to which the Company may be party at such time. If the Company fails to repurchase the senior notes as required by the indenture, it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes which, in turn, may
also constitute an event of default under other obligations.

Based on the trading prices of the debt at June 30, 2009 and 2008, the
estimated fair value of the debt at June 30, 2009 and 2008 was $702.0 million and $728.9 million, respectively.

NOTE 8—STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Equity Incentive Program

Under the Company’s current equity incentive program, the Company
issues equity awards under its 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”), under which officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants may be granted options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock, restricted stock
units and other types of equity awards.

Except for options granted to non-employee directors as part of their regular compensation package
for service through the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company has granted only restricted stock units under its equity incentive program since August 1, 2006. For the preceding several years until June 30, 2006, stock
options (except for the retroactively priced options which were granted primarily prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002) were generally granted at the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, with a vesting
period of five years and an exercise period not to exceed seven years (ten years for options granted prior to July 1, 2005) from the date of issuance. Restricted stock units may be granted with varying criteria such as service-based or
performance-based vesting. Substantially all of the Company’s employees that meet established performance goals and qualify as key employees participate in its main equity incentive plan.

On October 18, 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2004 Plan which provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units to its employees, consultants and members of its Board of Directors. The 2004 Plan permits the issuance of
up to 21.0 million shares of common stock, of which 6.1 million shares were available for grant as of June 30, 2009. Any 2004 Plan awards of restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units or deferred stock units with a
per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of fair market value on the grant date are counted against the total number of shares issuable under the 2004 Plan as 1.8 shares for every one share subject thereto. Total options outstanding under
all plans as of June 30, 2009 were 13.0 million shares with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.5 years. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, approximately 0.3 million restricted stock units were granted to
senior management with performance-based and service-based vesting criteria.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The following table summarizes the combined activity under the equity incentive plans for the
indicated periods:

(1)

Any 2004 Plan awards of restricted stock, performance shares, performance units or deferred stock units with a per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of fair market value
on the grant date are counted against the total number of shares issuable under the 2004 Plan as 1.8 shares for every one share subject thereto.

(2)

On November 15, 2007, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2004 Plan to increase the number of shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for
issuance under the 2004 Plan by 8.5 million shares.

The Company accounts for its stock-based awards exchanged for
employee services under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly, the fair value of stock-based awards is measured at grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period applying the straight-line
attribution approach. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of the Company’s common stock
on the grant date for restricted stock units.

Stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 includes a $20.3 million reversal of stock-based compensation charges related to the cancellation of
stock options and restricted stock units held by the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and $9.3 million of cash compensation related to bonuses payable to the holders of 409A Affected Options to compensate them for the increase in their
option exercise prices.

Stock Options

Except for options granted to non-employee directors as part of their regular compensation package for service through the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company has granted only restricted stock
units under its equity incentive program since August 1, 2006. Therefore, no comparative information is presented in the table below for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used
in the Black-Scholes valuation model:

(*)

The Company did not issue any stock options during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption was based on market-based implied
volatility from traded options on the Company’s stock.

Tax benefits realized in connection with option exercises for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 includes $7.9 million of tax benefit realized by the Company for the cash
bonuses paid during the three months ended March 31, 2008 related to 409A Affected Options.

As of June 30, 2009,
11.9 million options were exercisable with a weighted-average exercise price of $43.33 and weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.4 years. The aggregate intrinsic value for the options exercisable as of June 30, 2009 was
insignificant. As of June 30, 2009, the unrecognized stock-based compensation balance related to stock options was $15.7 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 1.2 years.

KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Since the beginning of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the restricted stock units granted
by the Company generally vest in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. Prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the restricted stock units granted by the Company generally vested in two equal
installments over four or five years from the date of the grant. The value of the restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of award. The restricted stock units have been awarded under
the Company’s 2004 Plan, and each unit will entitle the recipient to one share of common stock when the applicable vesting requirements for that unit are satisfied. However, for each share actually issued under the awarded units, the share
reserve under the 2004 Plan will be reduced by 1.8 shares, as provided under the terms of the 2004 Plan.

As of June 30, 2009, the
unrecognized stock-based compensation balance related to restricted stock units was $86.4 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 2.3 years.

In connection with the vested and released restricted stock units, the Company realized tax benefits of $13.3 million for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2009.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

KLA-Tencor’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) provides that eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their eligible earnings toward the semi-annual purchase of KLA-Tencor’s common stock.
The ESPP is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the employee’s purchase price was derived from a formula based on the fair market value of the common stock at the time
of enrollment into the offering period versus the fair market value on the date of purchase. During the quarter ended December 31, 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors, as part of the Company’s ongoing efforts to reduce operating
expenses, approved amendments to the ESPP so as to, among other things, reduce each offering period under the ESPP (and therefore the length of the look-back period) from 24 months to 6 months. This change became effective January 1, 2009, such
that the offering period that began on January 1, 2009 had a duration of six months, and the purchase price with respect to such offering period was 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the
commencement of the six-month offering period or (ii) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the purchase date.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors approved further amendments to the ESPP in continuation of the Company’s cost reduction efforts. These most recent amendments to the ESPP
(a) eliminate the look-back feature (i.e., the reference to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the commencement of the applicable six-month offering period) and (b) reduce the purchase price discount from 15% to
5%. These changes will be effective July 1, 2009, such that the purchase price with respect to each offering period beginning on or after such date will be 95% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the purchase date.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The Company estimates the fair value of purchase rights under the ESPP using a Black-Scholes
valuation model, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. The fair value of each purchase right under the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation
model and the straight-line attribution approach with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The following table shows total cash received from employees for the issuance of shares under the
ESPP, the number of shares purchased by employees through the ESPP, the tax benefits realized in connection with the disqualifying dispositions of shares purchased under the ESPP, and the weighted-average fair value per share:

The ESPP shares are replenished annually on the first day of each fiscal year by virtue of an
evergreen provision. The provision allows for share replenishment equal to the lesser of 2.0 million shares or the number of shares which KLA-Tencor estimates that it will be required to issue under the ESPP during the forthcoming fiscal year.
In the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, the Company estimated that it would need to issue up to 1.0 million shares under the ESPP during fiscal year 2009 and, in accordance with the evergreen provision of the ESPP,
increased the number of shares reserved under the ESPP by 1.0 million shares. That estimate was based on a number of factors, including historical participation rates and the Company’s stock price at such time. In light of the decline in
the Company’s stock price since the time of such original estimate, the Company revised its estimate during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 regarding the total number of shares that the Company would need to issue under the ESPP during
fiscal year 2009 from 1.0 million to 2.0 million (the default amount of the annual increase to the ESPP). Accordingly, in March 2009, the number of shares reserved under the ESPP was increased by an additional 1.0 million shares. As
of June 30, 2009, a total of 1.4 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP.

On October 12,
2006, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approved an alternative financial benefit consisting of a cash payment to all employees below the vice president level who had been active participants in the ESPP before it
was temporarily suspended on September 28, 2006. The alternative financial benefit was intended to compensate such employees for the estimated financial benefit they would have realized had the ESPP continued in operation after
September 28, 2006 and until December 31, 2006. On January 24, 2007, the Compensation Committee extended this alternative financial benefit into calendar year 2007 to cover the period until the ESPP suspension ended. The Company
recorded approximately $4.6 million for the alternative financial benefit during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as a component of stock-based compensation expense.

Former Chief Executive Officer Agreement and Termination

During November 2005, the Company announced that effective January 1, 2006, Kenneth L. Schroeder would cease to be its Chief Executive Officer and
would thereafter be employed as a Senior Advisor. The Company and Mr. Schroeder also revised his prior agreement with the Company and defined the salary, bonus payout and equity award vesting during the period of his employment as a Senior
Advisor. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company determined that all service conditions associated with certain prior equity awards under the terms of the revised agreement with Mr. Schroeder had been satisfied; and accordingly, the Company
recorded at that time an additional non-cash, stock-based compensation charge of approximately $9.8 million relating to these equity awards. The above mentioned charge is included as a component of Selling, General and Administrative
(“SG&A”) expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006.

On October 16, 2006, following the Special Committee
investigation of the Company’s historical stock option practices, the Company terminated all aspects of Mr. Schroeder’s employment relationship and agreement with the Company. As a result, vesting of Mr. Schroeder’s then
outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 0.9 million unvested option shares and 0.1 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the time of termination were
canceled. Accordingly, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the Company reversed $20.3 million of the non-cash, stock-based compensation charges in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 43 of SFAS No. 123(R), because Mr. Schroeder
would no longer be able to fulfill his service obligations. The $20.3 million reversal related to the charges that had been recorded in prior periods related to unvested option shares and restricted stock award shares.

In December 2006, the Company also canceled 0.6 million vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the time of termination, representing
those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. In accordance with paragraph 57 of SFAS No. 123(R), previously recognized stock-based compensation expense related to these awards was not reversed upon
cancellation.

IRC Section 409A Affected Options

Because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options that had been issued by the Company were not involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing, the Company took certain actions to deal with the adverse tax
consequences that may have been incurred by the holders of retroactively priced options. The adverse tax consequences were that retroactively priced stock options vesting after December 31, 2004 (“409A Affected Options”) subject the
option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar penalty taxes under California and other state tax laws). One such action by the Company involved offering to amend the 409A Affected Options to increase the
exercise price to the market price on the actual grant date or, if lower, the market price at the time of the amendment, in exchange for cash bonus payments to the option holders that were paid in January 2008 in an amount equal to the aggregate
increase in exercise prices of the amended 409A Affected Options held by such option holders. The amended options would not be subject to taxation under IRC Section 409A. Under IRS regulations, these option amendments had to be completed by
December 31, 2006 for anyone who was an executive officer when he or she received 409A Affected Options; the amendments for non-officers could not be offered until after the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2006 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 were filed and did not need to be completed until December 31, 2007. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the Company accrued
approximately $20.2 million for the cash bonuses payable to non-executive holders of the amended options to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option exercise prices. The $20.2 million of cash bonuses were paid in January 2008.
The amount of these bonuses would be effectively repaid to the Company if and when the options are exercised and the increased exercise price is paid. However, there is no assurance that the options will be exercised, and the employees will retain
the bonuses under all circumstances.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

In order to compensate certain option holders whose employment terminated or who had already exercised 409A Affected Options for the additional taxes they
would incur under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar state tax laws), the Company also recorded approximately $13.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The Company recorded no such charges during the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2008 and 2009.

Three of the Company’s option holders were subject to the December 31, 2006 deadline
described above. Accordingly, in December 2006, the Company offered to amend the 409A Affected Options held by Richard P. Wallace, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and two former executive officers to increase the options
exercise prices so that their 409A Affected Options would not subject the option holders to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A. All three individuals accepted the Company’s offer. In addition, the Company agreed to pay each of the three
individuals a cash bonus in January 2008 equal to the aggregate increase in the exercise prices for his amended options. For Mr. Wallace, the amount of this bonus was $0.4 million. To account for these actions, the Company recorded a charge of
$0.3 million, net of amount reclassified from capital in excess of par, during the nine months ended March 31, 2007. The cash bonus was paid in January 2008.

In addition, in the three months ended December 31, 2007, the Company agreed to amend 409A Affected Options held by two other executives and, in connection with those amendments, agreed to pay cash bonuses in
January 2008 to those two executives equal to the aggregate increase in the exercise prices for such 409A Affected Options. Accordingly, the Company accrued $0.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2007. These cash bonuses were
paid in January 2008.

With respect to certain individuals whose options were canceled or re-priced by the Company following the Special
Committee investigation, no bonuses of the type described above will be paid.

Executive Severance and Consulting Agreement

During August 2008, the Company announced that John H. Kispert, then the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer, would cease to be an
employee of the Company effective January 1, 2009. In accordance with the terms of a Severance and Consulting Agreement entered into between the Company and Mr. Kispert dated August 28, 2008, Mr. Kispert is entitled to receive,
in addition to certain cash payments and benefits, the following benefits related to his outstanding equity awards: (i) accelerated, pro-rated vesting of the unvested portion (as of the date that his employment with the Company terminates) of
all of his outstanding restricted stock units, such that a percentage of the unvested portion of each such restricted stock unit grant, representing the portion of the entire service vesting period under such grant that will have been served by
Mr. Kispert as of the date that he ceases to be an employee of the Company, will be accelerated; (ii) the acceleration of the delivery of all restricted stock units for which vesting is accelerated in accordance with the provisions of the
Severance and Consulting Agreement; and (iii) the extension of the post-termination exercise period of each of Mr. Kispert’s stock options so that each such option will remain exercisable for twelve months following the date
Mr. Kispert ceases to be an employee of the Company, but in no event beyond the original term of the award. In connection with the stock-related benefits agreed to under such agreement, the Company recorded an additional non-cash, stock-based
compensation charge of approximately $4.7 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, which was included as a component of selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense.

NOTE 9—STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

Since July
1997, the Board of Directors has authorized the Company to systematically repurchase up to 62.8 million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program in the open market. This plan was put into place to reduce the dilution from
KLA-Tencor’s employee benefit and incentive plans such as the stock option



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

and employee stock purchase plans, and to return excess cash to the Company’s shareholders. Subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements
and other factors, the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market in compliance with applicable securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder such as Rule 10b-18. In October
2008, the Company suspended its stock repurchase program. At June 30, 2009, 9.8 million shares were available for repurchase under the Company’s repurchase program.

Share repurchases for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

The $7.8 million which was accrued in other current liabilities related to unsettled repurchases
at June 30, 2008 was paid during the three months ended September 30, 2008.

The Company had shares issued and outstanding as of
June 30, 2009, 237.7 million and 170.7 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2008, shares issued and outstanding were 234.6 million and 174.0 million, respectively. The difference between shares issued and outstanding
is related to shares repurchased under various repurchase programs.

NOTE 10—NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that
would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock
method, which includes consideration of stock-based compensation required by SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

and SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per Share

. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net
income (loss) per share:

(1)

The potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share for the above periods because their effect would have been
anti-dilutive.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007
were $102.1 million, $108.5 million and $95.1 million, respectively.

As discussed in Note 20, “Subsequent Events,” on
August 6, 2009, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, to be paid on September 1, 2009 to stockholders of record on August 17, 2009.

NOTE 11—EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

KLA-Tencor
has a profit sharing program for eligible employees, which distributes, on a quarterly basis, a percentage of the Company’s pre-tax profits. In addition, KLA-Tencor has an employee savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement
under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. KLA-Tencor matched up to a maximum of $3,000 or 50% of the first $6,000 of an eligible employee’s contribution through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. During the quarter ended
March 31, 2009, as part of the Company’s continuing cost reduction efforts, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s 401(k) plan, which suspended the employer match feature effective July 1,
2009. The total charge to operations under the profit sharing and 401(k) programs aggregated $7.9 million, $14.3 million and $19.0 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. KLA-Tencor has no defined benefit
plans in the United States. In addition to the profit sharing plan and the United States employee savings plan, several of KLA-Tencor’s foreign subsidiaries have retirement plans for their full-time employees, several of which are defined
benefit plans. Consistent with the requirements of local law, the Company deposits funds for certain of these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and/or accrues for the unfunded portion of the
obligation. The assumptions used in calculating the obligation for the foreign plans depend on the local economic environment.

KLA-Tencor
adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),

effective June 30, 2007. Upon adoption, SFAS
No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined pension and postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability in its statement of financial position with an offsetting amount in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position. The benefit obligations and related assets under the
Company’s plans have been measured as of June 30, 2009 and 2008.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Summary data relating to the KLA-Tencor’s foreign defined benefit pension plans, including key
weighted-average assumptions used is provided in the following tables:



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The assumptions for expected rate of return on assets were developed by considering the historical
returns and expectations of future returns relevant to the country in which each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the corresponding plan. The discount rate for each plan was derived by reference to appropriate benchmark yields on
high quality corporate bonds, allowing for the approximate duration of both plan obligations and the relevant benchmark index.

Amounts
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consist of:

Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) expected to be recognized as components
of net periodic benefit cost over the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010 is as follows:

The components of KLA-Tencor’s net periodic cost relating to its foreign subsidiaries defined
pension plans are as follows:



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The foreign plans’ investments are managed by third-party trustees consistent with regulations
or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. KLA-Tencor is not actively involved in the investment strategy nor does it have control over the target allocation of these investments. These investments made up 100% of total foreign
plan assets in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Expected funding for the foreign plans during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2010 is $0.9 million.

The total benefits to be paid from the foreign pension plans are not expected to exceed $2.0
million in any year through 2019.

Executive Savings Plan

KLA-Tencor has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan whereby certain executives and non-employee directors may defer a portion of their salary and bonus. Participants are credited with returns based on their
allocation of their account balances among measurement funds. KLA-Tencor controls the investment of these funds and the participants remain general creditors of KLA-Tencor. Distributions from the plan commence the quarter following a
participant’s retirement or termination of employment. As of June 30, 2009, KLA-Tencor had a deferred compensation plan related asset and liability of $107.2 million and $108.3 million included as a component of other non-current assets
and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. As of June 30, 2008, KLA-Tencor had a deferred compensation plan related asset and liability of $144.9 million and $144.9 million included as a component of other
non-current assets and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively.

NOTE 12—INCOME TAXES

The components of net income (loss) before income taxes are as follows:

The provision for (benefit from) income taxes is comprised of the following:



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Actual current tax liabilities are lower than reflected above for the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 by $0, $4.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, primarily due to the stock option deduction benefits recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value.

The significant components of deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

As of June 30, 2009, the Company had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss
(“NOL”) carry-forwards of approximately $73.8 million, $124.1 million and $34.4 million, respectively. The U.S. net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2017 through 2027. The utilization
of NOLs created by acquired companies is subject to annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, it is not expected that such annual limitation will impair the realization of these NOLs. The state NOLs will begin
to expire in 2012. State credits of $44.7 million will be carried over indefinitely. The foreign net operating loss carry-forwards will begin to expire in 2013.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the Company generated U.S. federal and state NOLs of approximately $215.5 million and $84.0 million, respectively. The Company also generated U.S. federal and state tax
credits of approximately $63.1 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The Company expects to carry back the federal NOL and federal tax credit to fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2008, respectively.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The net deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $38.8 million as of June 30, 2009 compared to
zero as of June 30, 2008. The valuation allowance is based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Of the valuation allowance as of June 30, 2009,
$28.4 million relates to state credit carry-forwards. The remainder of the valuation allowance relates primarily to foreign net operating loss carry-forwards.

At June 30, 2009, the Company had cumulative windfalls in excess of shortfalls of approximately $6.0 million recorded as part of capital in excess of par. Windfall tax benefits arise when a Company’s tax
deductions for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are
recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes.

As of June 30, 2009, U.S. income taxes were not provided for on a cumulative total of approximately $209.2 million of undistributed earnings for
certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, they would generate foreign tax credits to reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend. Assuming a full utilization of
the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with undistributed earnings would be approximately $58.7 million.

KLA-Tencor benefits from several tax holidays in Israel and Singapore where it manufactures certain of its products. These tax holidays are on approved investments and are scheduled to expire at varying times within the next five to twelve
years. The Company is in compliance with all the terms and conditions of the tax holidays. The net impact of these tax holidays was to decrease the Company’s tax expense by approximately $8.9 million, $15.9 million and $13.6 million in the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax
rate to KLA-Tencor’s effective income tax rate is as follows:

On July 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. The adoption of FIN 48
resulted in a reduction of retained earnings of $8.4 million.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

A reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate was $49.7 million
and $60.4 million as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The balance of the gross unrecognized tax benefits is expected to be reduced by $11.7 million in the next twelve months due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations.

KLA-Tencor’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within interest income and other, net. The amount
of interest and penalties accrued as of June 30, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $5.9 million and $8.8 million, respectively. The Company is not under federal income tax examination at this time. The Company remains subject to federal income
tax examination for all years from the year ended June 30, 2006 forward. The Company is subject to state income tax examinations for all years from the year ended June 30, 2005 forward. The Company is also subject to examinations in major
foreign jurisdictions, including Israel and Singapore, for all years from the year ended June 30, 2004 forward and is currently under tax examinations in various foreign tax jurisdictions.

NOTE 13—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Factoring.

KLA-Tencor has agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of its trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. KLA-Tencor does not believe it is at risk for any material losses as a
result of these agreements. In addition, from time to time KLA-Tencor will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment for goods.

The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008:

(1)

Discounting fees were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest income and other, net.

Facilities.

KLA-Tencor leases certain of its facilities under operating leases, which qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS
No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

and, as such, these facilities are not included on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rent expense was approximately $12.3 million, $11.5 million and $9.7 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The following is a schedule of operating lease payments (in thousands):

Purchase Commitments.

KLA-Tencor maintains certain open inventory purchase commitments with
its suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. KLA-Tencor’s liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast
time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. The Company’s open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $74.4 million as of June 30, 2009 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary
based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for
potential cancellation penalties.

Guarantees.

KLA-Tencor provides standard warranty coverage on its systems for 40 hours per week
for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. KLA-Tencor accounts for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is
based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, KLA-Tencor calculates the average service hours and parts expense per system and applies the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated
warranty charge. KLA-Tencor updates these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases KLA-Tencor adjusts its warranty accruals accordingly.

The following table provides the changes in the product warranty accrual for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):

Subject to certain limitations, KLA-Tencor indemnifies its current and former officers and
directors for certain events or occurrences. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments KLA-Tencor could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited, the Company believes the fair value of this liability, to
the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve it has established for currently pending legal proceedings.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

KLA-Tencor is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify
the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses
arising from, or provides customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by the Company’s products, non-compliance with the Company’s product performance specifications, infringement
by the Company’s products of third-party intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to such matters as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement
of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by the Company is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with the Company pursuant to the procedures specified in
the particular contract. This usually allows the Company to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought
against the other party. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at the Company’s option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund
to the other party), and duration. In some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by the Company.

It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements have not had a material effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company maintains guarantee arrangements of $29.1 million in various locations to fund customs guarantees for VAT and LC needs of its subsidiaries in
Europe and Asia. Approximately $18.9 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of June 30, 2009.

NOTE 14—LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL
MATTERS

Government Inquiries and SEC Settlement Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices.

On May 23, 2006, the Company
received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office (“USAO”) requesting information relating to the Company’s past stock option grants and related accounting matters. Also on May 23, 2006, the Company received a
letter from the SEC making an informal inquiry and request for information on the same subject matters. The Company learned on February 2, 2007 that the SEC had opened a formal investigation into these matters. The Company cooperated fully with
the SEC investigation. On July 25, 2007, the Company announced that it had reached a settlement with the SEC by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal
controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement resolves completely the SEC investigation into the Company’s historical stock option granting practices. KLA-Tencor was not charged by the SEC with fraud, nor was the Company
required to pay any civil penalty, fine or money damages as part of the settlement. On July 31, 2008, the USAO informed the Company in July 2008 that it had closed its investigation and had determined not to take any action against the Company.
Both the SEC and USAO investigations with respect to the Company are now closed.

The Company has also responded to inquiries
from the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”), which conducted an examination of the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan prompted by the Company’s stock option issues. The Company cooperated fully with this examination, and the DOL has
advised the Company that it has closed its examination with no further action, subject to confirmation of resolution of any potential claims on behalf of the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan in connection with its investments in the Company’s
stock. The Company believes there is no basis for any such claims; however, an independent fiduciary appointed to act in the best interests of the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan has elected to participate in the previously announced settlement
of the shareholder class action of all potential non-ERISA claims (described below), which will



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

involve no additional cost to the Company, and the Company has agreed to enter into a separate settlement with the independent fiduciary of any and all
potential ERISA claims, in which the Company denied all liability and paid the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan a total of $25,000. As a result, the DOL examination has been concluded without any material adverse consequence to the Company. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Service conducted an audit covering calendar year 2006 related to the Company’s historical stock option practices, which was concluded in July 2008 with a payment by the Company of $0.1 million. There can be no
assurance that other inquiries, investigations or actions will not be started by other United States federal or state regulatory agencies or by foreign governmental agencies.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices.

Beginning on May 22, 2006, several persons and entities
identifying themselves as shareholders of KLA-Tencor filed derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the Company against several of the Company’s current and former directors and officers relating to its
accounting for stock options issued from 1994 to the present. The complaints in these actions allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and other obligations to the Company and violated state and federal securities laws
in connection with the Company’s historical stock option granting process, its accounting for past stock options, and historical sales of stock by the individual defendants. Three substantially similar actions are pending, one in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Federal Derivative Action,” which consists of three separate lawsuits consolidated into one action); one in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County; and one in the
Delaware Chancery Court.

The plaintiffs in the derivative actions have asserted claims for violations of Sections 10(b) (including
Rule 10b-5 thereunder), 14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting such breach, negligence, misappropriation of information, abuse of control, gross
mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, breach of contract, constructive fraud, rescission, and violations of California Corporations Code section 25402, as well as a claim for an accounting of all stock option grants made to the named defendants.
KLA-Tencor is named as a nominal defendant in these actions. On behalf of KLA-Tencor, the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and other relief against the named defendants. The plaintiffs are James Ziolkowski, Mark Ziering, Alaska Electrical
Pension Fund, Jeffrey Rabin and Benjamin Langford. The individual named defendants are current directors and officers Edward W. Barnholt, Robert T. Bond, Stephen P. Kaufman, and Richard P. Wallace; and former directors and officers H.
Raymond Bingham, Robert J. Boehlke, Leo Chamberlain, Gary E. Dickerson, Richard J. Elkus, Jr., Dennis J. Fortino, Jeffrey L. Hall, John H. Kispert, Kenneth Levy, Michael E. Marks, Stuart J. Nichols, Arthur P. Schnitzer, Kenneth L. Schroeder, Jon D.
Tompkins and Lida Urbanek. Current director David C. Wang and former director Dean O. Morton were originally named as defendants in one of the derivative actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, but
were dropped as named defendants as of December 22, 2006 upon the filing of a consolidated complaint in that action.

The derivative
actions are at an early procedural stage. The defendants are not yet required to respond to the complaints in the actions. The Company’s Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee (“SLC”) composed solely of
independent directors to conduct an independent investigation of the claims asserted in the derivative actions and to determine the Company’s position with respect to those claims. On March 25, 2008, the SLC filed a motion to terminate the
Federal Derivative Action and to approve certain settlements with Gary E. Dickerson, Kenneth Levy, Kenneth Schroeder and Jon D. Tompkins related to the claims brought against them in connection with the derivative actions. The Court denied the
motion to terminate and to approve the settlements on December 12, 2008. The SLC filed an appeal and petition for writ of mandate challenging that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which dismissed the appeal
on May 8, 2009 and denied the petition for writ of mandate on July 10, 2009. As a result, the derivative actions remain ongoing. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint in the Federal Derivative Action and will not be
required to do so until after plaintiff has had an opportunity to amend the complaint. The parties are currently participating in a



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

mediation of the derivative claims in the Federal Action. No defendant is yet required to answer the complaints in the state court derivative actions in the
California Superior Court for Santa Clara County and the Delaware Chancery Court. Response dates in the California Superior Court action have been stayed until responses are due in the Federal Derivative Action. It is not known whether the
California Superior Court action will remain stayed after that time. On March 17, 2009, the Delaware Chancery Court issued an order staying the Delaware action so that the litigation of the issues can be confined to the prior Federal Derivative
Action. Plaintiff sought leave to appeal the stay decision, which was denied by the Chancery Court on April 14, 2009. Plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court seeking to overturn the Chancery Court’s
denial of the application to appeal, which the Delaware Supreme Court denied on April 27, 2009.

The Company cannot predict whether
these derivative actions are likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to KLA-Tencor.

Shareholder Class Action Litigation
Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices.

KLA-Tencor and various of its current and former directors and officers were named as defendants in putative securities class action filed on June 29, 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California. Two similar actions were filed later in the same court, and all three cases were consolidated into a single action. On September 26, 2008, Judge Charles Breyer of the Northern District granted final approval of
a settlement resolving all class claims and dismissing with prejudice all claims brought by the consolidated action. The class action had alleged material misrepresentations in the Company’s SEC filings and public statements and brought claims
under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 14(a), Section 20(a), and Section 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a result of the Company’s past stock option grants and related accounting and reporting.
The settlement resolved all claims against all defendants, who were KLA-Tencor, Edward W. Barnholt, H. Raymond Bingham, Robert T. Bond, Gary E. Dickerson, Richard J. Elkus, Jr., Jeffrey L. Hall, Stephen P. Kaufman, John H. Kispert, Kenneth Levy,
Michael E. Marks, Stuart J. Nichols, Kenneth L. Schroeder, Jon D. Tompkins, Lida Urbanek and Richard P. Wallace.

The Company made a
payment of $65.0 million to the settlement class as a term of the court-approved settlement during the three months ended September 30, 2008, which provides a full release of KLA-Tencor and the other named defendants in connection with the
allegations raised in the lawsuit. The Company had reached an agreement in principle to resolve the action prior to December 31, 2007, and therefore an amount of $65.0 million was accrued by a charge to selling, general and administrative
expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2007.

Another plaintiff, Chris Crimi, filed a putative class action complaint in
the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Santa Clara on September 4, 2007 against the Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers. The plaintiff sought to represent a class consisting of persons
who held KLA-Tencor common stock between September 20, 2002 and September 27, 2006, originally alleging causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and rescission based on alleged misstatements and omissions in the Company’s SEC
filings concerning the Company’s past stock option grants, and seeking unspecified damages based upon purported dilution of the Company’s stock, injunctive relief, and rescission. The plaintiff named the Company, Edward W. Barnholt, H.
Raymond Bingham, Robert T. Bond, Richard J. Elkus, Jr., Stephen P. Kaufman, Kenneth Levy, Michael E. Marks, Dean O. Morton, Kenneth L. Schroeder, Jon D. Tompkins, and Richard P. Wallace as defendants in the action. The Company filed a demurrer to
the complaint, which was sustained, and then removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California upon plaintiff’s filing an amended complaint. The Company then filed a motion to dismiss the action in the Northern
District of California, which was granted in part, with the remaining claims being remanded back to the California Superior Court on September 12, 2008. The Company filed a demurrer to plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint and plaintiff
responded by agreeing to dismiss the action with prejudice, bringing an end to this action.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

As part of a derivative lawsuit filed in the Delaware Chancery Court on July 21, 2006, a
plaintiff claiming to be a KLA-Tencor shareholder also asserted a separate putative class action claim against the Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers alleging that shareholders incurred damage due to purported
dilution of KLA-Tencor common stock resulting from historical stock option granting practices. On March 17, 2009, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the putative class action claim and stayed the derivative claims in the action. Plaintiff
sought leave to appeal this decision, which the Chancery Court denied on

April 14, 2009. Plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court seeking to overturn the Chancery Court’s denial of the
application to appeal, which the Delaware Supreme Court denied on April 27, 2009.

A final judgment has not been entered in the
Delaware Chancery Court action, and the Company cannot predict the final outcome or estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse result. However, an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse impact
upon the financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods.

Litigation with Former CEO Kenneth Schroeder.

On April 17, 2009, Kenneth Schroeder, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, served the Company with a lawsuit filed in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara
County asserting various contract and tort claims in connection with the Company’s termination of Mr. Schroeder and the cancellation of certain of his stock options and restricted stock units in October 2006. The Company filed a motion to
compel arbitration of Mr. Schroeder’s claims on June 15, 2009. The California Superior Court issued an order compelling the arbitration of his claims and staying the state court action on July 27, 2009. The Company has not yet
responded to Mr. Schroeder’s claims. The Company denies having any liability and intends to vigorously defend itself against all claims asserted by Mr. Schroeder.

At this early stage of the litigation, the Company cannot predict the final outcome or estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse result. However, an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could
have a material adverse impact upon the financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods.

Indemnification Obligations.

Subject to certain limitations, the Company is obligated to indemnify its current and former directors, officers and employees in connection with the investigation of the
Company’s historical stock option practices and the related litigation and ongoing government inquiry. These obligations arise under the terms of the Company’s certificate of incorporation, its bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware
and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that the Company is required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters.
The Company is currently paying or reimbursing legal expenses being incurred in connection with these matters by a number of its current and former directors, officers and employees. It is also paying defense costs to two former officers and
employees facing SEC civil actions to which the Company is not a party. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments KLA-Tencor could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited, the Company believes the fair
value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve it has established for currently pending legal proceedings.

Other Legal Matters.

The Company is named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of its business. Litigation, in general, and intellectual property and securities litigation in
particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of outcome. The Company believes the
amounts provided in its financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimated liabilities. However, because such matters are subject to many uncertainties, the ultimate outcomes are not predictable and there can be no assurances
that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from the matters described above will not exceed the amounts reflected in the Company’s financial statements or will not have a material adverse effect on its results of
operations, financial condition or cash flows.

NOTE 15—RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

In March 2009, the Company announced a plan to further reduce its global workforce by approximately 10%, which followed the Company’s announcement in
November 2008 of a global workforce reduction of approximately 15%. The Company is undertaking a number of cost reduction activities, including these workforce reductions, in an effort to lower its quarterly operating expense run rate in response to
the current demand environment. The program in the United States is accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112,

Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits—an amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statements
No. 5 and 43,

whereas the programs in the international locations are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the Company recorded a
$38.7 million net restructuring charge, of which $15.9 million was recorded to costs of revenues, $8.6 million to engineering, research and development expense and $14.2 million to selling, general and administrative expense. These charges
represent the estimated minimum liability associated with expected termination benefits to be provided to employees after employment.

The
following table shows the activity primarily related to severance and benefits expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009:

Substantially all of the restructuring charges related to the Company’s workforce reductions
announced in November 2008 and March 2009 are expected to be paid out by the end of calendar year 2009.

NOTE 16—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
ACTIVITIES

SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, requires companies to recognize all
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the statement of financial position. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the Company designates foreign currency forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of certain
forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and purchase transactions.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the changes
to the disclosure requirements for derivative and hedging activities of SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

. SFAS No. 161 requires the
Company to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why the Company uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and
(c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.

KLA-Tencor’s foreign subsidiaries operate and sell KLA-Tencor’s products in various global markets. As a result, KLA-Tencor is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. KLA-Tencor utilizes foreign currency forward
exchange contracts and options to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain existing and forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and purchase transactions. KLA-Tencor does not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company routinely hedges its exposures to certain foreign currencies with various financial institutions in an effort to



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations. If a financial counter-party to any of the Company’s hedging arrangement experiences
financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, the Company may experience material financial losses.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS
No. 133, gains and losses are recognized in interest income and other, net. The majority of such derivatives are foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. The gains and losses on
these derivatives are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

The outstanding notional
amounts of hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows:

The location and fair value amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments reported in its

performance. KLA-Tencor’s chief operating decision maker is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

KLA-Tencor is engaged primarily in designing, manufacturing, and marketing process control and yield
management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. All operating units have been aggregated due to their inter-dependencies, commonality of long-term economic characteristics, products and services, the production
processes, class of customer and distribution processes. The Company’s service products are an extension of the system product portfolio and provide customers with spare parts and fab management services (including system preventive maintenance
and optimization services) to improve yield, increase production uptime and throughput, and lower the cost of ownership. Since KLA-Tencor operates in one segment, all financial segment information required by SFAS No. 131 can be found in the
consolidated financial statements.

KLA-Tencor’s significant operations outside the United States include manufacturing facilities in
Israel and Singapore, and sales, marketing and service offices in Western Europe, Japan and the Asia Pacific region. For geographical revenue reporting, revenues are attributed to the geographic location in which the customer is located. Long-lived
assets consist primarily of net property and equipment and are attributed to the geographic region in which they are located.

The
following is a summary of revenues by geographic region for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Long-lived assets by geographic region as of June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, two customers, Intel Corporation and Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd., accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, two
customers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Intel Corporation, accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of
net accounts receivable.

NOTE 18—SALE AND IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as part of the Company’s long-term business plan, the Company decided to sell certain real estate
properties owned by the Company in San Jose, California and Livermore, California. Based on the valuation of these assets using relevant market indicators such as range of estimated selling prices, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of
approximately $56.8 million, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the Company completed the sale of real estate
properties in Livermore, California and recognized a gain of $9.0 million as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as part of the ongoing cost reduction efforts, the Company
decided to sell the remaining real estate properties owned by the Company in San Jose, California and a portion of the real estate property in Chennai, India. Based on the valuation of these assets using relevant market indicators such as range of
estimated selling prices, the Company recorded asset impairment charges of approximately $2.4 million, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

In addition, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale and leaseback of certain buildings
located in San Jose, California. The sale transaction, which closed on March 26, 2008, resulted in proceeds to the Company of $28.8 million and a gain on sale of $13.2 million. Under the agreement, the Company leases back the buildings for
periods ranging from 3 months to 39 months (which includes the optional one year extension period). Under the provisions of SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

, the Company immediately recognized $8.5 million of the gain, which represents
the portion of the gain in excess of the present value of the minimum lease payments, and deferred the remaining gain of $4.7 million, which will be amortized ratably in proportion to rent expense over the 39-month term of the lease. Total
amount of gain recognized during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were $1.4 million and $9.1 million, respectively. The Company was recognizing the rent expense related to rental payments on a straight line basis over the term of
the lease. As part of the ongoing cost reduction efforts, during the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company vacated these buildings in an effort to consolidate the facilities and is in the process of negotiating with the landlord for an
early lease termination. As a result, the Company accrued $1.6 million during the



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

three months ended June 30, 2009 for the estimated remaining lease payments. Total rent expense recorded during the fiscal years ended June 30,
2009 and 2008 related to these buildings were $3.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively.

In addition, during the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the Company completed the sale of certain real estate located in Chennai, India and recognized a gain of $2.0 million as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses.

NOTE 19—RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

During the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and/or 2007, the Company purchased from, or sold to, JDS Uniphase Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., National Semiconductor Corp., STMicroelectronics, NV, Oracle Corporation and Cisco Systems,
where one or more members of the Company’s Board of Directors, or their immediate family members, also serves (or, for the applicable time period, served) as an executive officer or board member. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009,
2008 and 2007, the Company’s total revenues from transactions with these parties (for the portion of such period that they were considered related) were approximately $8 million, $40 million and $40 million, respectively. In addition, for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company’s total purchases from transactions with these parties (for the portion of such period that they were considered related) were approximately $5 million, $8 million and $3
million, respectively. The Company had a receivable balance from these parties of approximately $1 million and $13 million at June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Management believes that such transactions are at arms length and on similar
terms as would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.

NOTE 20—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On August 6, 2009, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, to

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of KLA-Tencor Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of KLA-Tencor Corporation and its subsidiaries at June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2009 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and
financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, effective July 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of financial Accounting Standard No. 109

and changed its method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has
excluded the MIE business unit from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2009 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during the year ended June 30, 2009. We have also
excluded the MIE business unit from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The MIE business unit is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 5.0% and 2.8%, respectively, of the related consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2009.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report are certifications of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). This Controls and Procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred
to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

The Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) as of the end of
the period covered by this Report required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b). The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO. Based
on this evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Definition of Disclosure Controls

Disclosure
Controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company’s Disclosure Controls include components of its internal control over financial reporting, which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. To the extent that components of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting are included within its Disclosure Controls, they are included in the scope of the Company’s annual controls evaluation.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the CEO
and CFO, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2009.

The Company has excluded the MIE business unit from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2009 because this
entity was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. This entity is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose combined total assets and combined total revenues represent 5.0% and 2.8%,
respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.



The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
June 30, 2009 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company’s Disclosure Controls or internal control over financial
reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.
