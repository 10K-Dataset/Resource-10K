PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

The Company

KLA-Tencor Corporation (“KLA-Tencor” or the “Company” and also referred to as “we” or “our”) is the world’s
leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. Our products are also used in a number of other industries, including wafer manufacturing and data storage.

Within our primary area of focus, our comprehensive portfolio of products, services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit (“IC”)
manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication process—from research and development to final volume production. These products and solutions are designed to help customers accelerate their development cycles, bring their fabs to
production more quickly and achieve higher and more stable yields.

KLA-Tencor’s products and services are used by virtually every
major wafer, IC and photomask manufacturer in the world. These customers turn to us for inline wafer defect monitoring; reticle and photomask defect inspection; critical dimension (“CD”) metrology; wafer overlay metrology; film and surface
measurement; and overall yield and fab-wide data analysis. Our advanced products, coupled with our unique yield technology services, allow us to deliver the yield management solutions our customers need to accelerate their yield learning rates,
reduce their yield excursion risks and adopt industry-leading yield management practices.

KLA-Tencor Corporation was formed in April 1997
through the merger of KLA Instruments Corporation and Tencor Instruments, two long-time leaders in the semiconductor equipment industry, each with over 20 years of experience. KLA Instruments Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1975; Tencor
Instruments was incorporated in California in 1976. Effective April 30, 1997, a wholly owned subsidiary of KLA Instruments Corporation merged into Tencor Instruments, and Tencor Instruments became a wholly owned subsidiary of KLA Instruments
Corporation. Immediately following this merger, KLA Instruments Corporation changed its name to KLA-Tencor Corporation.

Additional
information about KLA-Tencor is available on our web site at www.kla-tencor.com. We make available free of charge on our web site our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those

Industry

General Background

The semiconductor or integrated
circuit (“IC” or “chip”) industry is KLA-Tencor’s core focus. The semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is six, eight or twelve inches in diameter, about as thick as a
credit card and gray in color. The process of manufacturing wafers is itself highly sophisticated, involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon. The ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished
to a mirror finish.

The manufacturing cycle of an IC is grouped into three phases: design, fabrication and testing. IC design involves the
architectural layout of the circuit, as well as design verification and photomask or reticle generation.



The fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors, semiconductors or insulators. The deposition of these
film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns, remove portions of the film layers, and perform other functions such as heat treatment, measurement and inspection. Most advanced chip designs require
hundreds of individual steps, many of which are performed multiple times. Most chips consist of two main structures: the lower structure, typically consisting of transistors or capacitors, which performs the “smart” functions of the chip;
and the upper ‘interconnect’ structure, typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure. When all of the layers on the wafer have been completed, each die on the wafer is then tested for
functionality.

Current Trends

Companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market. During past industry cycles, semiconductor manufacturers
generally contended with one key new technology or market trend, such as a specific design rule shrink. In today’s market, the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new technologies into production at the
same time, including new substrate and film materials and advanced lithography techniques.

While many of these technologies have been
adopted at the development and pilot production stages, significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected their adoption into full-volume production. For example, as design rules decrease, yields become more sensitive to
the size and density of defects, while device performance characteristics (namely speed or capacity) become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation. New process materials, such as high-k dielectrics,
silicon-on-insulator (“SOI”) wafers and immersion lithography-capable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process. Moving several of these advanced technologies into production at
once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face.

The continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex
multi-level circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices. Construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over $3 billion, substantially
more than previous generation facilities. As a result, chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment.

By developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production, we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly
expensive facilities, reduce their production costs and significantly improve their return on investment (“ROI”). Once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume, our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process
excursions are identified and quickly resolved. Historically, the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules has increased in-process variability and thus has often required increased inspection and metrology sampling.

With our broad portfolio of application-focused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise, we are in position to be a key supplier of
comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ next-generation products, including those required for the 45nm generation and beyond.

Our
Process Control and Yield Acceleration Solutions

Accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of high-performance
devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing. Ramping to high-volume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an IC manufacturer realizes for a given product. KLA-Tencor systems not only analyze
defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer, photomask and IC manufacturing processes, but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems. The ability to locate
the source of defects and characterize process issues enables our



customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes, so they can increase their yield of high-performance parts—thus maximizing their
profit.

Products

KLA-Tencor operates
primarily in one segment for the design, manufacture and marketing of process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industry. We also currently offer products that serve the wafer manufacturing, data
storage and other industries. We design, market, manufacture and sell our equipment—consisting of patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection, optical overlay metrology, electron-beam (e-beam) review, reticle and photomask inspection, and film
and surface measurement tools—as well as our advanced yield analysis and defect classification software to provide fab-wide yield management solutions. These solutions are optimized for the manufacturing process cells used in IC production,
including lithography, deposition, etch, and chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). Our offerings can be broadly categorized into four groups: Defect Inspection; Metrology; product related services; and Software. For our customers manufacturing
larger design-rule devices, we provide refurbished KLA-Tencor Certified tools along with warranty and support.

Defect Inspection

KLA-Tencor’s defect inspection tools allow our customers to detect, count, classify and characterize yield failures caused by particles, pattern
defects, surface anomalies and electrical issues during all stages of the IC manufacturing process. Our portfolio of tools enables our customers to ramp their production lines faster by finding new defect types during development and ramp, and to
maintain high and stable yields by monitoring defect count by type during production.

Defect inspection is especially critical as our
customers move to production of 65nm design-rule devices, and begin development of the 45nm node. The number of yield-relevant defects increases as semiconductor process tolerances (“process windows”) become tighter, a result of smaller,
more densely packed semiconductor circuit patterns. Also, new defect types and yield issues arise from the necessary introduction of innovative materials, device structures and lithography techniques. As a result, chip manufacturers need to inspect
more wafers per lot, more process layers and more area on the wafer, at higher sensitivities. KLA-Tencor supplies a wide portfolio of high performance inspection, classification and analysis systems that enable our customers to solve their toughest
yield issues.

High-Sensitivity Broadband Brightfield Inspection

Brightfield inspection systems provide benchmark sensitivity to small defects, and
capture the greatest range of defect types, which becomes increasingly important as our customers move to 45nm and smaller production. Our 2800

™

Series brightfield inspection system has
been widely adopted at leading-edge memory, logic and foundry fabs worldwide, because it delivers the sensitivity and production-worthy performance that chipmakers need to produce market-leading devices. Key to the 2800 inspection system’s
success is the industry’s only full-spectrum broadband light source, spanning deep ultraviolet to visible wavelengths. With the ability to tune its wavelength and employ various optical modes and algorithms, the 2800 inspection system provides
sensitivity to an unequalled range of defect types throughout the chip manufacturing process. In June 2007 we introduced the newest additions to our 28xx product series, the 2810 and 2815. Targeting the 45nm node, these are the first inspection
systems designed specifically for memory or logic applications. The 2810 and 2815 have twice the computing speed of the 2800 and new optical modes that enable increased defect capture.

High-Performance Darkfield Inspection

Darkfield inspection systems are used to cost effectively monitor process tools for
defect yield excursions. Our widely-adopted Puma

™

Series darkfield inspection platform
leverages our patented Streak

™



laser imaging technology to produce the highest sensitivities at production throughputs of any darkfield inspection system on the market. Combining advanced
UV-laser illumination optics with a solid-state sensor to image the scattered light, Streak is scalable for multiple technology generations.

In September 2006, we introduced the Puma 9110 and 9130. The Puma 91xx platform builds on the advantages of the Puma 9000, with double its throughput, as well as greater sensitivity and ease of use. In June 2007, we
added to the 91xx family by introducing the Puma 9150, which features enhancements that further increase the range of defect types that the system can capture.

High Resolution Electron Beam Review and Classification

Once a defect has been identified, a chipmaker must be able to review and classify the defect in order to identify and address the cause of the defect. As chipmakers moved to the 45nm node, however, inspection tools
were identifying defects that fell below the resolution limit of the review tools commercially available at that time. To address this situation, we re-entered the defect review and classification market by introducing the eDR

™

-5200 in early July 2007. The eDR-5200 features a lens system that delivers a significant
improvement in resolution, meeting production and process development requirements for advanced design-rule semiconductor devices. Unique connectivity technology between the eDR-5200 and our market-leading inspection systems provides additional
benefits to our customers with respect to defect re-detection, classification and speed. Because the eDR-5200 was introduced after the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, sales of this product are not reflected in the
financial statements included in this report.

Wafer and Film Surface Inspection

All chipmakers extensively utilize inspection tools to detect defects on blanket
(unpatterned) films and bare wafer surfaces. Our Surfscan SP2

™

and Surfscan

®

SP2

XP

products are designed to detect those types of defects.

Unpatterned Wafer and Film Surface Inspection: For certain types of inspection,
such as the qualification of new process tools, periodic checks of process tools already in production, or qualification of process tools after maintenance, chipmakers may prefer to use bare or blanket-film wafers instead of patterned wafers. The
Surfscan SP2

™

incorporates UV illumination technology to significantly enhance inspection sensitivity and speed on IC films, as well as both traditional silicon and engineered substrates.
The Surfscan SP2 is capable of detecting defects as small as 30nm at higher throughputs than that of the previous-generation Surfscan SP1

DLS

inspection
system.

Bare Wafer Surface Inspection

:

The wafer
substrate is the foundation of an integrated circuit. Having a defect-free wafer substrate is essential, since defects on the surface of the wafer can adversely affect subsequent semiconductor processes, and ultimately impact IC performance. In
January 2007 we introduced the Surfscan SP2

XP

, a system which has the speed and sensitivity of the Surfscan SP2, plus a new optical subsystem that allows
the tool to distinguish between inherent defects in the silicon crystal—which can kill transistors and thus require scrapping the wafer—and other defect types that may be eliminated through cleaning or re-polishing the wafer. The Surfscan
SP2

XP

provides wafer manufacturers with the ability to scrap fewer wafers, enhancing their profitability. This tool has been adopted by all major wafer
manufacturers worldwide.

Electron-Beam Inspection

For advanced IC manufacturing, e-beam inspection is essential—not only during IC development, where the highest sensitivity is needed
to discover defects, but also in production, where dedicated systems are required to monitor key process steps for defect excursions. Only e-beam technology can find the smallest physical defects and the subtle electrical defects that plague
customers as they introduce new materials and device structures at the 65nm and 45nm nodes.



In February 2006, we introduced
the latest addition to our eS3x series of e-beam inspection systems—the eS32

™

. A single system spanning development and production applications, the eS32 e-beam inspection system
provides the best sensitivity at throughput for defect types that optical systems cannot find.

Macro Defect Inspection for Wafer
Dispositioning

Advanced fabs require accurate and rapid disposition decision making during manufacturing, as well as
quick assessment of tool and process module output. Operators have historically performed this task by visually inspecting a small sample of wafers for macro defects under a manual or semi-automated light microscope. However, advanced 300mm
manufacturing, with large wafer surfaces, smaller device features and factory automation, challenges the ability of the operator to assess wafers and lots in a reliable and repeatable manner. These conditions place large quantities of valuable
wafers at risk.

In May 2006, we introduced the Viper 2435XP

™

automated 300mm wafer and tool dispositioning system, which captures a broad range of defect types at very high throughput—enabling inspection of 100% of wafer lots. Delivering quick
go/no-go decisions, the system enables fab engineers to take corrective action early, when wafers can be reworked or process tool problems can be repaired before additional lots are put at risk. Viper 2435XP can be integrated rapidly and seamlessly
into a production environment in the lithography, CMP, etch, and films process modules.

Wafer Edge Inspection

As customers move to smaller design rules and new, more complex material stacks, the high stress wafer edge region has become a source of
yield-limiting defects. Material at the edge of the wafer can flake off and fall onto the regions where the chips are being built, causing loss of yield. The recent introduction of immersion lithography adds to the potential for flakes to migrate
and cause yield loss, since the flakes can be transported by the immersion fluid.

To help customers identify and fix these edge-related yield issues, KLA-Tencor introduced the VisEdge

™

CV300, in October 2006. The tool’s unique optics
design and advanced defect classification capabilities allow IC manufacturers to capture a wide range of wafer-edge defect types with high sensitivity.

Reticle Inspection

Reticles are high-precision quartz plates that contain
microscopic images of electronic circuits. Placed into steppers or scanners, reticles are used to transfer circuit patterns onto wafers to fabricate ICs. It is extremely important that these features are printed correctly on the reticles; very small
variations in line width or placement, or defects within or adjacent to these structures, can cause devastating yield loss in the printed die.

In 2007, we introduced the TeraScanHR

™

reticle inspection system, which provides unique defect-detection and productivity features that enable the production of defect-free reticles. The new system includes higher resolution optical imaging and several
new inspection modes that enable the system to find all types of reticle defects. The TeraScanHR system’s high sensitivity, improved productivity, and flexible configurations make it a cost-effective solution that meets the needs of reticle
manufacturers.

IC wafer fabs use the STAR

light

-2

™

inspection system to qualify incoming reticles for use in IC production, and also to re-check the reticle periodically as it is used in production. Based on the TeraScan

™

platform, STAR

light-2

offers high sensitivity to contamination, progressive defects (crystals which grow on the reticles over time), and the damage from electrostatic discharge.

Process Window Qualification

Reticles used in the manufacture of today’s advanced ICs incorporate complex techniques that enable lithographers to extend existing lithographic processes to print features smaller than the wavelength of light



used—a process called sub-wavelength lithography. These techniques reduce the size and fine-tune the shape of features on the wafer. During the
photolithography patterning process, marginal designs can print as out-of-focus features—or not print at all, creating open circuits that translate to electrical failures within the device. However, since these errors represent design
marginalities rather than physical defects on the reticle, they cannot be caught using traditional reticle inspection.

Our
Process Window Qualification (“PWQ”) solution enables device manufacturers to identify reticle design marginalities by examining the wafer for poorly printed features using our broadband brightfield wafer inspection systems, so the
manufacturers can then make more informed decisions about how closely they will operate near the boundaries of the process window, and how to address any design marginalities resulting from that decision.

Transparent Film and Opaque Substrate Inspection

Understanding the optical surface properties of modern materials has become a
critical part of manufacturing. With the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes and products comes the need for extremely precise analysis and control of surface properties such as film thickness uniformity, contamination and defectivity,
often in real time and online. The Candela

™

CS20 Optical Surface Analyzer automatically detects and classifies surface defects on optoelectronic and semiconductor wafers, including wafers
made of transparent materials such as sapphire and glass. By simultaneously measuring reflectivity and topographic variations on the surface, these systems enable customers to inspect epitaxial layers and film coatings for uniformity issues and
defects.

Metrology

Metrology is a
critical discipline in the production of high performance, reliable devices. Whether verifying that a design will be manufacturable, characterizing a new process, or monitoring high-volume manufacturing, our comprehensive set of metrology, analysis
and process window optimization products gives IC manufacturers the ability to maintain tight control of their processes.

Optical
Overlay Metrology

Decreasing linewidths, larger die sizes and increasing chip density all affect the tolerances for
layer-to-layer alignment, or

overlay

. Mis-registration errors represent a crucial cause of yield loss. Today’s lithography scanners or steppers require in-line monitoring to ensure layer-to-layer alignment is within-spec. These advanced
lithography systems also require regular maintenance and performance tests to ensure they are meeting process requirements. Overlay metrology systems verify scanner or stepper performance by measuring the pattern alignment between adjacent layers of
the chip, as it is built.

In 2006, we introduced the Archer 100

™

Overlay Control System, based on the industry-proven Archer

™

platform. Fully redesigned optics, tighter stage tolerances, and new imaging and illumination modes combine to deliver
the high levels of performance and productivity needed to address increasingly tighter overlay error budgets.

CD
Metrology

The critical dimension (CD) is the smallest intended linewidth for a given device. While a useful measurement
for previous-generation devices, traditional CD measurements no longer provide all the information that chipmakers need to accurately predict yield and transistor performance. Instead, complete profile information, including the width at the top and
bottom of the feature, the sidewall angle and the height or depth of the feature, are needed. For this reason, CD control in the fab is increasingly changing from traditional CD-SEM (scanning electron microscope) measurements to optical CD.

In 2006, we introduced the SpectraCD-XT

™

—our fourth-generation of inline optical CD metrology systems for advanced patterning process control. The SpectraCD-XT is a non-destructive, dedicated CD and



profile metrology system built on our high-throughput, production-proven Archer platform. With a move-acquire-measure (“MAM”) time under two
seconds and a throughput of over 100 wafers per hour, the SpectraCD-XT leads the industry in productivity, allowing chipmakers to detect even the smallest profile excursions rapidly and repeatably.

Film Measurement

Our
film metrology systems measure a variety of optical and electrical properties of thin films deposited on a wafer. These systems are used to control a wide range of wafer fabrication steps, where both within-wafer and wafer-to-wafer process
uniformity are critical to achieving high device performance at low cost.

SpectraFx 200

™

, our seventh-generation thin-film metrology system, builds upon our expertise in spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) to measure the thickness and optical properties of
complex, multi-layer film stacks. SpectraFx 200 introduces new technology to extend the measurement results from patterned targets to predict in-die process variation. This technique enables IC manufacturers to achieve cost-effective production
control over their advanced film processes at the 65nm node and below.

Contamination Monitoring

One of the key parts of a transistor is called the gate, and the quality of the
dielectric that comprises it is critical to the overall speed and reliability of the IC device. In today’s devices, gate dielectric films have become so thin that their electrical performance characteristics are as critical as their physical
characteristics in determining overall transistor performance. Our Quantox

™

product line provides non-contact, inline electrical performance measurements of key parameters that determine
the quality of advanced gate dielectric films, including contamination and oxide thickness, as well as electrical capacitance and leakage. Our latest Quantox XP

™

system provides
information on both the physical and electrical properties of advanced gate dielectric materials. Quantox data from the gate dielectric has shown high correlation to electrical test data on the finished device. This correlation enables chipmakers to
predict transistor performance inline, rather than having to wait until an end-of-line electrical test—a process that normally takes days or weeks to complete.

Implant Metrology

KLA-Tencor
now offers implant and anneal micro-uniformity monitoring with the Therma-Probe

®

solution. Therma-Probe is the industry standard for implant dose metrology. With its advances in modulated
optical reflectance, Therma-Probe provides dose measurements for in-line monitoring, including anneal and ultra-shallow junction (USJ) depth profiling. The system contributes to higher yield by monitoring for process excursions.

Substrate & Surface Metrology

At the 45nm node and below, small deviations in wafer shape such as bow, warp and edge roll-off can translate to intolerable errors in the IC’s critical dimensions and layer-to-layer alignment. With our
acquisition of ADE Corporation, we are well positioned to provide the wafer shape metrology equipment required by both wafer and IC manufacturers, for the 45nm node and beyond.

WaferSight

™

and
NanoMapper

™

are high-precision surface mapping systems for bare wafers, based on optical interferometry. The WaferSight system measures full-wafer dimensional parameters such as
flatness, bow and thickness. These measurements are made on every advanced bare wafer shipped to fabs, to ensure it meets the stringent requirements of advanced lithography and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). NanoMapper provides whole-wafer
nanotopography measurements for polished wafer surfaces with sub-nanometer height sensitivity. NanoMapper also includes interactive 3D graphics and analysis software, allowing rapid visualization and quantification of nanotopography effects, for
faster process development and precision process control during production.



In substrate and media
manufacturing, we offer metrology and defect inspection solutions with our Candela

™

and ADE series of optical and magnetic inspection systems. Our Candela 6100 and 6300 series patented
X-beam optical surface analyzers are the industry leaders in defect sensitivity and characterization for substrate and media manufacturing. Those products are now complemented by certain products that we acquired from ADE, such as the MicroXam

™

and OptiFLAT

™

optical interferometers for disk flatness and waviness metrology, as well as the magnetic products that provide
critical metrology for perpendicular magnetic recording process control, including the Diskmapper

®

M3.

Our stylus profilers measure the surface topography of films and etched surfaces,
and are used in basic research and development as well as semiconductor production and quality control. We also offer the P-16+

™

benchtop contact stylus profiler, designed for automated
step height, surface contour, waviness and roughness measurements, with detailed 2D and 3D topographic analysis of a variety of surfaces and materials.

Process Metrology Systems

KLA-Tencor now offers specialized, instrumented substrates
that measure a wafer’s response to the process inside the process chamber, while the process is occurring. These metrology wafers measure the temperature variation of the process over time, to optimize, troubleshoot and monitor complex
processes, such as plasma etch. Other measurement parameters are also available, including plasma monitoring. Both chipmakers and process equipment manufacturers use these wafers to visualize, diagnose and control their processes and process tools
in a wide variety of applications.

within analysis recipes. These processes are automatically triggered when user-specified events occur. In addition to freeing fab engineers from repetitive analysis tasks, this capability dramatically improves fab operating efficiency by providing
relevant information in less time and with less effort for faster identification of yield problems.

Our Klarity ACE

™

yield analysis solution enables fast integration, correlation and analysis of yield- and process-related data to accurately determine the
source of defects and process excursions. It can differentiate between random and systematic yield problems, providing users with the data they need in order to take appropriate corrective measures.



Klarity SSA

™

(Spatial Signature Analysis) provides automated classification and root cause analysis of spatial signatures—defect clusters and patterns that indicate a potential out-of-spec process or
process tool problem. Klarity SSA can be utilized for a variety of applications where enhanced excursion detection is needed, including process line and tool monitoring, as well as engineering analysis.

FabVision

™

is a
real-time, fab-wide data management system that continuously monitors, reports and manages product quality information. Alerts on process excursions, daily reports and selected data are generated and sent automatically worldwide to better manage
operations at the fab, process or customer level. The integrated database enables quick analysis and response to customers’ inquiries about product history and quality. With real-time production information, the FabVision system provides
management, engineering and operations with the capability to proactively detect process excursions that can lead to yield loss.

Our ProDATA

™

lithography data analysis tool, along with our PROLITH

™

lithography and etch optimization tool, helps manufacturers reduce their advanced lithography development time and cost, as well as
optimize their design-for-manufacturing (“DFM”) efforts.

Our iDO

™

(inline Defect Organizer) automated defect classification (“ADC”) solution provides consistent and accurate classification of yield-limiting defects to help our
customers accelerate their ramp to higher process yields. iDO uses an intuitive decision-tree format to split classification into a series of logical steps. Leveraging local defect geometry for improved performance, iDO works with KLA-Tencor defect
inspection, review and data analysis systems for excursion monitoring, excursion problem resolution, and baseline yield improvement.

Our Archer Analyzer

™

software provides critical post processing of overlay data into information which indicates appropriate corrective action for the relevant process tool. This function is increasing in importance with sub-65nm design rules, immersion lithography and
double patterning lithography.

Computational Lithography

As customers move to smaller design rules, they must print very small features and complex patterns. The resolution required to create
these features is more than today’s lithography scanners can provide directly, because the features are smaller than the wavelength of the light used to create them. In order to increase the effective resolution of the process, our customers
are using reticle enhancement techniques (RETs) such as Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAF).

Introduced in May 2007, our LithoWare

™

lithography optimization tool analyzes design layout constraints, as well as the manufacturing process variability of focus and exposure during lithography. Systematic errors in these areas can create either open
circuits that translate to electrical failures, or geometric variations that result in speed and performance issues within the device. LithoWare is designed to reduce the time and cost required to develop RET and OPC processes.

Customers

To support our growing, global customer
base, we maintain a significant presence throughout the United States, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Japan, staffed with local sales and applications engineers, customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants. We count among our
largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers from each of these regions. In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.

Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand
for ICs and products utilizing ICs. We do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature, but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers, and it is impacted by the investment
patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets. Downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.



Sales, Service and Marketing

Our sales, service and marketing efforts are aimed at building long-term relationships with our customers. We focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield
management products and services. Customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination, as well as the increased equipment compatibility, that are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier. Our revenues are derived primarily
from product sales, mostly through our direct sales force.

We believe that the size and location of our field sales, service and
applications engineering, and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets. We have direct sales forces in the United States, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Japan. We maintain an export compliance program that is
designed to fully meet the requirements of the United States Departments of Commerce and State.

As of June 30, 2007, we employed
approximately 2,500 sales and related personnel, service engineers and applications engineers. In addition to sales and service offices in the United States, we conduct sales, marketing and services out of wholly-owned subsidiaries or branches of
United States subsidiaries in other countries, including China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom. International revenues accounted for approximately 76.3%, 79.9%,
and 76.3% of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in Note 14, “Segment
Reporting and Geographic Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We believe that sales outside the United States will
continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to compete successfully in Asia, one of the largest markets for our equipment. Our ability to compete in this area
is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the United States, and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region.

International sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, restrictions on export
technology, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations. In addition, international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in
each country. The revenues from our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we attempt to manage the currency risk inherent in non-dollar sales through hedging activities, there can be no
assurance that such efforts will be adequate. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.

Backlog

Our backlog for system shipments and associated warranty totaled $1,060.8 million and $998.7 million as of June 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. We include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within twelve months from the date of order. Orders for service and unreleased products are excluded from the
backlog. We expect to fill the present backlog of orders during fiscal year 2008; however, all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders, our backlog
at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period.

Research and Development

The market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation. These technical
innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. We believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our
competitive position.



Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close
relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs. As part of our customer relationships, we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby our customers offset certain of our research and development
costs. As of June 30, 2007, we employed approximately 1,300 research and development personnel.

Our key research and development
activities during fiscal year 2007 involved development of process control and yield management equipment for sub-65nm processing. For information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years, including costs
offset by our strategic development and engineering programs, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry, we are committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product
improvement and new product development. New product introductions may contribute to fluctuations in operating results, since customers may defer ordering existing products. If new products have reliability or quality problems, those problems may
result in reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products, or
that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace. If we do not successfully introduce new products, our results of operations will be adversely affected.

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies

We perform system design, assembly and testing in-house
and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies. Our in-house manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through third-party
vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products. Our principal manufacturing activities take place in San Jose and Milpitas, California, with additional significant operations in Migdal Ha’Emek, Israel and Northtech,
Singapore. As of June 30, 2007, we employed approximately 1,000 manufacturing personnel.

Many of the parts, components and
subassemblies (collectively “parts”) that we use are standard commercial products, although certain parts are made to our specifications. We use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products. Although we
make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts are available from multiple suppliers, this is not always possible and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We endeavor
to minimize the risk of production interruption by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts, by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers, and by ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain
manufacturing schedules.

Although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, in some cases the partial or
complete loss of certain of these sources could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers, damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Competition

The worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly
competitive. In each of our product markets, we face competition from established and potential competitors, some of which may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have, such as Applied
Materials, Inc. and Hitachi Electronics Engineering Co., Ltd. We may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their
current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with



improved price and performance characteristics. We believe that to remain competitive, we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range
of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process research and development.

Significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, installed base and technical service and support. We believe that, while price and delivery
are important competitive factors, the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to
enhance productivity.

Management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services.
However, any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues, gross margins and market share, any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.

Acquisitions and Alliances

We continuously evaluate
strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations,
technologies and products of the acquired companies, possible write-downs of impaired assets, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. The inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating
results and financial condition. Additional information regarding our business combinations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 can be found in Note 5, “Business Combinations” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Patents and Other Proprietary Rights

We protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws, including patent, copyright and trade secret. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the United States and abroad and intend to
continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws. In addition, from time to time we acquire license rights under United States and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.

Although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business, due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process
control and yield management systems industry, we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise, continuing development of new systems, market
penetration, installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide.

No assurance can be given
that patents will be issued on any of our applications, that license assignments will be made as anticipated, or that our patents, licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. No assurance can be given
that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology.

Employees

As of June 30, 2007, we employed approximately 6,000 people. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not
experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.

Competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the
semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management, marketing and technical employees.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our operating results and stock
price have varied widely in the past, and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon numerous factors, including those listed in this section and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our stock
price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well. In addition, our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends.

We believe the factors that could make our results fluctuate and difficult to predict include:

•

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;

•

global economic uncertainty;

•

competitive pressures;

•

our ability to develop and implement new technologies and introduce new products;

•

our ability to maintain supply of key components;

•

our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements;

•

our reliance on services provided by third parties;

•

our customers’ acceptance and adoption of our new products and technologies;

•

our ability to protect our intellectual property;

•

litigation regarding intellectual property and other business matters;

•

our ability to attract, retain and replace key employees;

•

our ability to manage risks associated with acquisitions and alliances;

•

the amount of resources we are required to devote to compliance with securities laws and listing requirements;

•

worldwide political instability;

•

earthquake and other uninsured risks;

•

future changes in accounting and tax standards or practices;

•

changing legal and regulatory environment;

•

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

our ability to successfully modify new systems and guard against computer viruses; and

•

our ability to continue to successfully address and resolve all issues arising from the discovery that we had retroactively priced stock options (primarily from
July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2002) and had not accounted for them correctly.

Operating results also could be
affected by sudden changes in customer requirements and other economic conditions affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets in which we do business. As a result of these or other factors, we could fail
to achieve our expectations as to future revenue, gross profit and income from operations. Our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price of our
stock, particularly on a short-term basis, and could negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock.



Risks Associated with Our Industry and Market Conditions

The semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical. The purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the
local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide. If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.

The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict. This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately
predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels. When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain
competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees. In addition, during periods of rapid
growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand. We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles.

Our business is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses. A majority of our annual revenue is
derived from outside the United States, and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue. A protracted global economic slowdown may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

A majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the United States, and we expect that international revenue will continue
to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue. Our international revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each country and region. Because of our significant dependence on international revenue, a decline in the
economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business could negatively affect our operating results. Managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with, among other things, cultural
diversity and organizational alignment. Moreover, each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period. Periodic
local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues, political instability, legal or regulatory changes or terrorism in regions where we have operations along with fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively
affect our business and results of operations. Although we attempt to manage near-term currency risks through the use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate.

Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide.

Our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies
with greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of
products and services, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer. These competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products, including pricing such competitive tools
significantly below our product offerings. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer, using innovative technology to
sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could negatively affect our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margins, and market share, any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Business

If we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed.

Success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions.
For example, the size of semiconductor devices continues to



shrink and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes. While we expect these trends will increase our
customers’ reliance on our diagnostic products, we cannot be sure that they will directly improve our business. These and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue
older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support. Technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees. Our competitive advantage and future business
success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards, to develop and introduce new products that successfully address changing customer needs, to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new
products in a timely and cost-effective manner.

In this environment, we must continue to make significant investments in research and
development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality. Substantial research and development
costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products. There can be no assurance that revenue from future
products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements. In addition, we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be
able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us. Our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products.

Our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.

We use a wide range of materials in the production of our products, including custom electronic and mechanical components, and we
use numerous suppliers to supply these materials. We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders, we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials
for manufacturing. We seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts, monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and
maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Our operating
results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements, or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms.

Disruption of our manufacturing facilities due to earthquake, flood, other natural catastrophic events or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and could seriously harm our
business.

Most of our manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, with small operations located in Israel and
Singapore. Operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural
disasters. Such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers. We cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that, if it were available, it could be obtained
on favorable terms.

We outsource a number of services to third-party service providers, which decreases our control over the
performance of these functions. Disruptions or delays at our third-party service providers could adversely impact our operations.

We outsource a number of services, including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts, to domestic and overseas third-party service providers. While outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations, they also
reduce our direct control over the services rendered. It is uncertain what effect such



diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered, or our ability to quickly respond to changing market
conditions. Disruptions or delays at our third-party service providers due to events such as regional economic, business, environmental or political events, information technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact our
operations and our ability to ship products, manage our product inventory or record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.

Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. If we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology, we may lose valuable assets and market share.

Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. We own various United States and international
patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually
result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies and
obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own, adversely affecting our business.

We also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation. However, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and
copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.

While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our
intellectual property is important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary
information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. We also maintain exclusive and non-exclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology
used in certain products. However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or
sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In any event, the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited,
and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors.

We might be involved in
intellectual property disputes or other intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve, prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.

As is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry, from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the
existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. Litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant
management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms. Our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to
consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate. However, we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. The inability to
obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms, or the instigation of litigation or other administrative proceedings, could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.

We depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our key employees, our sales
and product development could be harmed.

Our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and other
employees are difficult to replace. We generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees. Further, we do not



maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. The expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for
qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain key personnel, or if we are not able to attract, assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future, our business and operations could be harmed.

Acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but, because of the uncertainties involved, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates
and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.

In addition to our efforts to develop new
technologies from internal sources, part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources. As part of this effort, we may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with
complementary products, services and/or technologies. There can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful. In addition, we may use equity to finance future acquisitions,
which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current shareholders.

If we are unable to successfully integrate
and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly, then our business and financial results may suffer. It is possible that the businesses we have acquired, as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future, may perform
worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected. In addition, we may lose key employees of the acquired companies. As a result, risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material
adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons, including:

•

we may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses;

•

we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions;

•

we may have to write-off goodwill or other intangible assets; and

•

we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions.

Compliance with federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as Nasdaq requirements, is becoming increasingly complex, and the
significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business.

Federal securities
laws, rules and regulations, as well as Nasdaq rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise
standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations. These laws, rules and regulations have
increased and will continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations.

We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war. If international political
instability continues or increases, our business and results of operation could be harmed.

The threat of terrorism targeted at the
regions of the world in which we do business, including the United States, increases the uncertainty in our markets. Any act of terrorism which affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business. Increased
international political instability, disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks, and the continuing instability in the Middle East, may hinder our ability to do business and may increase
our costs of operations. Such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such



transportation unreliable, increase our insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to fluctuate. This same instability could have the same
effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products. If this international political instability continues or increases, our business and results of operations could be harmed. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and
interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war.

We self insure certain risks including earthquake risk. If one or more of
the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.

We purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of
certain insurable risks; however, certain other risks are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant cost and cannot be mitigated with insurance. An earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, most of which are
conducted in California. It could also significantly delay our research and engineering effort on new products, most of which is also conducted in California. We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake, but there is
no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake. We self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage
available in the earthquake insurance market. Certain other risks are also self insured either based on a similar cost benefit analysis, or based on the unavailability of insurance. If one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer
major financial loss.

A change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a
significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective.

New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may
adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

For example, the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

which required us to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method beginning in fiscal year 2006 and record such expense in our
consolidated financial statements, has had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We are exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environments where we perform our operations and conduct our business.

We are subject to various risks related to new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be
enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply, including environmental and safety regulations. Changes to existing laws, rules or regulations, including changes that
result in inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules or regulations, in the countries in which we operate may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; although we hedge certain currency risks, we may still be adversely affected by
changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries.

We have some exposure to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Japanese Yen. We have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally. We routinely hedge these exposures in an effort to minimize the impact of currency rate
fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency rate fluctuations. To the extent that these hedges are inadequate, our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected.



We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest
rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.

Our investment portfolio consists of both corporate and government
securities that have a maximum effective maturity of 10 years. The longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As yields increase, those securities with a lower
yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. We have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity. Unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and bond yields.

We rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operation. Our inability to use or access these information systems at
critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operation.

Our global operations are
linked by information systems, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, network communications, email and various computer hardware and software applications. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our
tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites. Any such event could have an adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

We may experience difficulties with our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system and
other IT systems. System failure or malfunctioning may result in disruption of operations and the inability to process transactions, and this could adversely affect our financial results

.

System failure or malfunctioning could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our results of operations,
financial position and cash flows. Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our ERP system or other systems could also adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our
internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we encounter unforeseen problems with regard to our ERP system or other systems, our business could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to the Restatement of Our Prior Financial Results

Our efforts to correct past material weaknesses in our internal controls may not have been sufficient, and we may discover additional material weaknesses in our internal controls.

As previously disclosed, the Company has undergone an investigation of the Company’s historical stock option practices by the Special Committee of
the Company’s Board of Directors (for more information regarding the Special Committee investigation and its findings, please refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”). As a result of that Special Committee investigation and our
management’s internal review of our historical stock option practices and related matters, we identified past material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures (see Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures”). A “material
weakness” is a control deficiency, or combination of them, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement in our financial statements will not be prevented or detected. We believe that we have remedied the past
material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures, but there can be no assurance that our corrections were sufficient or fully effective, or that we will not discover additional material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures
in the future.

The Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices and the resulting restatements have been
time consuming and expensive, and have had a material adverse effect on us.

The Special Committee investigation and the resulting
restatement activities have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses. In addition, we have established a Special Litigation Committee to oversee the litigation matters that have
arisen out of the



investigation and the restatements, and we cannot predict what additional actions may be required by these Committees. The period of time that will be
necessary to resolve these matters is uncertain, and these matters could require significant additional attention and resources.

The
ongoing government inquiry relating to our historical stock option practices is time consuming and expensive and could result in injunctions, fines and penalties that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow.

On July 25, 2007, we announced that the Company had reached a settlement with the SEC by consenting
to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement resolves completely the SEC investigation into the Company’s
historical stock option granting practices. KLA-Tencor was not charged by the SEC with fraud, nor was the Company required to pay any civil penalty, fine or money damages as part of the settlement. While the SEC has completed its investigation, the
inquiry by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“USAO”) into our historical stock option practices is ongoing. We have fully cooperated with the USAO and intend to continue to do so. The period
of time necessary to resolve this inquiry is uncertain, and we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry or whether we will face additional government inquiries, investigations or other actions related to our historical stock option practices. This
inquiry may require us to continue to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses, and could result in criminal actions seeking, among other things, injunctions against the Company and the payment of significant
fines and penalties by the Company, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

We have been named as a party to a number of shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits relating to our historical stock option practices, and we may be named in additional lawsuits in the future. This litigation could become
time consuming and expensive and could result in the payment of significant judgments and settlements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

In connection with our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements, a number of derivative actions were filed against certain of our
current and former directors and officers purporting to assert claims on the Company’s behalf. In addition, a number of securities class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers
seeking damages related to our historical stock option practices and the resulting investigation, inquiries and restatements. There may be additional lawsuits of this nature filed in the future. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits, nor
can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve these lawsuits. If these lawsuits become time consuming and expensive, or if there are unfavorable outcomes in any of these cases, there could be a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our insurance coverage will not cover our total liabilities and
expenses in these lawsuits, in part because we have a significant deductible on certain aspects of the coverage. In addition, subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees in
connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and ongoing government inquiry. We currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers, although our insurance coverage
may not be sufficient in some or all of these matters. Furthermore, the insurers may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters, in which case we may have to self-fund all or a substantial portion of our indemnification
obligations.

We are subject to the risks of additional government actions, shareholder lawsuits and other legal proceedings related
to our historical stock option practices, the resulting restatements, and the remedial measures we have taken.

It is possible that
there may be additional governmental actions, shareholder lawsuits and other legal proceedings brought against us in connection with our historical stock option practices. In addition, we may be



sued or taken to arbitration by former officers and employees in connection with their stock options, employment terminations and other matters. These
proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses, and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business. These expenditures and diversions, as well as the
adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC, affect our Nasdaq listing, and adversely affect our stock price.

The Securities and Exchange Commission, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to
include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In
addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. The Company has in prior periods identified certain material
weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. However, we believe the Company remediated those past material weaknesses, and we have not identified any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Although we review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with
our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if our independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements, rules and/or regulations
differently from our interpretation, then they may decline to attest to management’s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence
in the reliability of our financial statements, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price.

It may be difficult or
costly to obtain director and officer insurance coverage as a result of the issues arising out of our historical stock option practices.

We expect that the issues arising from our previous retroactive pricing of stock options will make it more difficult to obtain director and officer insurance coverage in the future. If we are able to obtain this coverage, it could be
significantly more costly than in the past, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flow. As a result of this and related factors, our directors and officers could face increased risks of personal liability in connection
with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified directors and officers, which could adversely affect our business.

PROPERTIES

Information regarding our principal
properties as of June 30, 2007 is set forth below:



(1)

Portions of certain properties are sublet or are vacant and marketed to sublease.

(2)

Certain properties in San Jose, California and Livermore, California were placed for sale in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

(3)

The land on which the Serangoon, Singapore building resides is leased.

As of June 30, 2007, we owned or leased a total of approximately 3.0 million square feet of space worldwide, including the locations listed above and office space for smaller sales and service offices in
several locations throughout the world. Our operating leases expire at various times through June 30, 2018 with renewal options at the fair market value for additional periods up to five years. Additional information regarding these leases is

have capacity adequate for our current needs, even after giving effect to the sale of certain properties as noted above.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Special Committee Investigation of Historical
Stock Option Practices

On May 22, 2006, the Wall Street Journal published an article about stock option backdating that questioned
the stock option practices at several companies, including KLA-Tencor. On May 23, 2006, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“USAO”) and a letter of inquiry from
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding our stock option practices. Later on May 23, 2006, our Board of Directors appointed a Special Committee composed solely of independent directors to conduct a
comprehensive investigation of our historical stock option practices. The Special Committee promptly engaged independent legal counsel and accounting experts to assist with the investigation. The investigation included an extensive review of our
historical stock option practices, accounting policies, accounting records, supporting documentation, email communications and other documentation, as well as interviews of a number of current and former directors, officers and employees. On
September 27, 2006, the Special Committee reported the bulk of its findings and recommendations to our Board of Directors.

Restatements of Prior
Period Consolidated Financial Statements in Previous Filings

On September 28, 2006, we announced that we would have to restate our
previously issued financial statements to correct our past accounting for stock options. As a result of the Special Committee investigation, we discovered that certain of our stock options, primarily those granted from July 1, 1997 to
June 30, 2002, had been retroactively priced for all employees who received these grants. This means that the option exercise price was not the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date of the option, but instead was a lower
market price on an earlier date. The actual grant date—when the essential actions necessary to grant the option were completed, including the final determination of the number of shares to be granted to each employee and the exercise
price—is the correct measurement date to determine the market price of the option shares under the accounting rules in effect at the time. More than 95% of the total in-the-money value (market price on the actual grant date minus exercise
price) of all of our retroactively priced options was attributable to those granted from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2002.

In our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 (filed on January 29, 2007) and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, December 31, 2006 and



March 31, 2007 (filed on January 29, 2007, February 9, 2007 and May 7, 2007, respectively), we restated (1) our consolidated
financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004; (2) our selected consolidated financial data as of and for our fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002; and (3) our unaudited
quarterly financial data for the first three quarters in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and for all quarters in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. All financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflects our
restatement and does not contain any further restatement.

Findings Leading up to Restatement and Certain Remedial Actions

By October 16, 2006, the Special Committee had substantially completed its investigation. The Special Committee concluded that (1) there was
retroactive pricing of stock options granted to all employees who received options, primarily during the periods from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2002 (less than 15% of these options were granted to executive officers), (2) the
retroactively priced options were not accounted for correctly in our previously issued financial statements, (3) the retroactive pricing of options was intentional, not inadvertent or through administrative error, (4) the retroactive
pricing of options involved the selection of fortuitously low exercise prices by certain former executive officers, and other former executives may have been aware of this conduct, (5) the retroactive pricing of options involved the
falsification of Company records, resulting in erroneous statements being made in financial and other reports previously filed with the SEC, as well as in information previously provided to our independent registered public accounting firm, and
(6) in most instances, the retroactive pricing of options violated the terms of our stock option plans. Because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options issued by the Company were not involved in or aware of the retroactive
pricing, the Board of Directors decided that we should continue to honor the options that violated the terms of the Company’s stock option plans, except in certain individual cases as described below.

The Special Committee concluded that, with a few immaterial exceptions, the retroactive pricing of stock options stopped after June 30, 2002. After
that time, there were procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that stock options were priced on the grant date. The Special Committee also concluded that none of our independent directors was involved in or aware of the
retroactive pricing of stock options. Based on the Special Committee’s report, our Board of Directors concluded that no current members of management were involved in the retroactive pricing of stock options. During its investigation of our
historical stock option practices, the Special Committee did not find evidence of any other financial reporting or accounting issues.

As a
result of the Special Committee investigation, on October 16, 2006, we terminated our employment relationship and agreement with Kenneth L. Schroeder, and we announced our intent to cancel all outstanding stock options held by
Mr. Schroeder that were retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. Those options were canceled in December 2006. Mr. Schroeder was the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a member of its Board of Directors from mid-1999
until January 1, 2006, and was a member of the Company’s stock option committee from 1994 until December 31, 2005. From January 1, 2006 to October 16, 2006, Mr. Schroeder was employed as a Senior Advisor to the Company.
On November 10, 2006, Mr. Schroeder’s counsel informed us that Mr. Schroeder contests our right to terminate his employment relationship and agreement and to cancel any of his options. We intend to vigorously defend any claims
that may be made by Mr. Schroeder regarding these matters, which could involve a material amount.

Also on October 16, 2006,
Stuart J. Nichols, Vice President and General Counsel, resigned. Mr. Nichols and we entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release under which Mr. Nichols’ outstanding retroactively priced stock options have been re-priced by
increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. Under SFAS No. 123(R), no incremental charge was recognized in the financial statements during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

On October 16, 2006, Kenneth Levy, Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, retired as a director and employee,
and was named Chairman Emeritus by our Board of Directors. Mr. Levy and we entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release under which Mr. Levy’s outstanding retroactively



priced stock options have been re-priced by increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. Under SFAS
No. 123(R), no incremental charge was recognized in the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Mr. Levy was the Company’s Chief Executive Officer from 1975 until mid-1999 (with the exception of mid-1997 to
mid-1998), was a member of the Company’s Board of Directors from 1975 until his retirement, was Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1999 until his retirement, and was a member of the Company’s Stock Option Committee from 1994 until use
of that committee was suspended in the fall of 2006.

On December 21, 2006, Jon D. Tompkins resigned as a director of the Company, and
we agreed to modify the outstanding options held by Mr. Tompkins (all of which were fully vested) to extend the post-termination exercisability period to December 31, 2007, which is the last day of the calendar year in which those options
would have terminated in the absence of such extension. Mr. Tompkins, the Chief Executive Officer of Tencor Instruments before its merger into the Company in mid-1997, was the Company’s Chief Executive Officer from mid-1997 to mid-1998,
was a member of the Company’s stock option committee from mid-1997 until mid-1999, and was a member of the Company’s Board of Directors from mid-1997 until his resignation.

Although the Board of Directors concluded that John H. Kispert, our President and Chief Operating Officer, was not involved in and was not aware of the
improper stock option practices, based on the Special Committee’s recommendation, his outstanding retroactively priced options have been re-priced because he served as Chief Financial Officer during part of the period in question. This
re-pricing involved increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. Under SFAS No. 123(R), no incremental charge was recognized in the financial statements during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2007.

Government Inquiries and SEC Settlement Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices

On May 23, 2006, we received a subpoena from the USAO requesting information relating to our past stock option grants and related accounting matters.
Also on May 23, 2006, we received a letter from the SEC making an informal inquiry and request for information on the same subject matters. We learned on February 2, 2007 that the SEC had opened a formal investigation into these matters.
We cooperated fully with the SEC investigation. On July 25, 2007, we announced that the Company had reached a settlement with the SEC by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the reporting, books and
records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement resolves completely the SEC investigation into the Company’s historical stock option granting practices. KLA-Tencor was not charged by the SEC with fraud;
nor was the Company required to pay any civil penalty, fine, or money damages as part of the settlement.

We are cooperating fully with the
USAO’s continuing inquiry and intend to continue to do so. This inquiry may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses, and could result in criminal actions seeking, among other things,
injunctions against the Company and the payment of significant fines and penalties by the Company, which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.

We have also responded to inquiries from the U.S. Department of Labor, which is conducting an examination of our 401(k) Savings Plan prompted by our stock option issues. We are cooperating fully with this examination
and intend to continue to do so.

We cannot predict how long it will take to or how much more time and resources we will have to expend to
resolve these government inquiries, nor can we predict the outcome of these inquiries. Also, there can be no assurance that other inquiries, investigations or actions will not be started by other United States federal or state regulatory agencies or
by foreign governmental agencies.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices

Beginning on May 22, 2006, several persons and entities identifying themselves as shareholders of KLA-Tencor filed derivative actions purporting to
assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the Company



against various of our current and former directors and officers relating to our accounting for stock options issued from 1994 to the present. The complaints
in these actions allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and other obligations to the Company and violated state and federal securities laws in connection with our historical stock option granting process, our
accounting for past stock options, and historical sales of stock by the individual defendants. Three substantially similar actions are pending, one in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (which consists of three separate
lawsuits consolidated in one action); one in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County; and one in the Delaware Chancery Court.

The plaintiffs in the derivative actions have asserted claims for violations of Sections 10(b) (including Rule 10b-5 thereunder), 14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty and
aiding and abetting such breach, negligence, misappropriation of information, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, breach of contract, constructive fraud, rescission, and violations of California Corporations Code
section 25402, as well as a claim for an accounting of all stock option grants made to the named defendants. KLA-Tencor is named as a nominal defendant in these actions. On behalf of KLA-Tencor, the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and other
relief against the named defendants. The plaintiffs are James Ziolkowski, Mark Ziering, Alaska Electrical Pension Fund, Jeffrey Rabin, and Benjamin Langford. The individual named defendants are current directors and officers; Edward W. Barnholt, H.
Raymond Bingham, Robert T. Bond, Jeffrey L. Hall, Stephen P. Kaufman, John H. Kispert, Lida Urbanek and Richard P. Wallace; and former directors and officers; Robert J. Boehlke, Leo Chamberlain, Gary E. Dickerson, Richard J. Elkus, Jr., Dennis J.
Fortino, Kenneth Levy, Michael E. Marks, Stuart J. Nichols, Arthur P. Schnitzer, Kenneth L. Schroeder and Jon D. Tompkins. Current director David C. Wang and former director Dean O. Morton were originally named as defendants in one of the derivative
actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, but were dropped as named defendants as of December 22, 2006 upon the filing of a consolidated complaint in that action.

The derivative actions are at an early stage. The defendants are not yet required to respond to the complaints in the actions pending in California, and
the defendants have moved to dismiss or stay the action pending in Delaware. Our Board of Directors has appointed a Special Litigation Committee (“SLC”) composed solely of independent directors to conduct an independent investigation of
the claims asserted in the derivative actions and to determine the Company’s position with respect to those claims. The SLC’s investigation is in progress. We cannot predict whether these actions are likely to result in any material
recovery by or expense to KLA-Tencor.

Shareholder Class Action Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices

KLA-Tencor and various of our current and former directors and officers were named as defendants in a putative securities class action filed on
June 29, 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Two similar actions were filed later in the same court, and all three cases have been consolidated into one action. The consolidated complaint alleges claims
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a result of our past stock option grants and related accounting and reporting, and seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of purchasers of
KLA-Tencor stock between June 30, 2001 and May 22, 2006 who allegedly suffered losses as a result of material misrepresentations in KLA-Tencor’s SEC filings during that period. The lead plaintiffs, who seek to represent the class, are
the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System, and the City of Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement. The defendants are KLA-Tencor, Edward W. Barnholt, H.
Raymond Bingham, Robert J. Boehlke, Robert T. Bond, Gary E. Dickerson, Richard J. Elkus, Jr., Jeffrey L. Hall, Stephen P. Kaufman, John H. Kispert, Kenneth Levy, Michael E. Marks, Stuart J. Nichols, Kenneth L. Schroeder, Jon D. Tompkins, Lida
Urbanek and Richard P. Wallace.

This litigation is at an early stage. Discovery has not commenced, and the court has not yet determined
whether the plaintiffs may sue on behalf of any class of purchasers. The Company and all other defendants filed motions to dismiss these cases in June 2007, which are now pending before the Court. The Company intends to vigorously defend this
litigation.



As part of a derivative lawsuit filed in the Delaware Chancery Court on July 21, 2006 (described
above), a plaintiff claiming to be a KLA-Tencor shareholder also asserted a separate putative class action claim against KLA-Tencor and certain of our current and former directors and officers alleging that shareholders incurred damage due to
purported dilution of KLA-Tencor common stock resulting from historical stock option granting practices. The Company has moved to dismiss this claim.

We cannot predict the outcome of the shareholder class action cases (described above), and we cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results. However, an unfavorable outcome in this
litigation could have a material adverse impact upon our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods.

Indemnification Obligations

Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our
current and former directors, officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and ongoing government inquiry. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate
of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other
liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. We are currently paying or reimbursing legal expenses being incurred in connection with these matters by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the
maximum potential amount of future payments KLA-Tencor could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve
we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.

Other Legal Matters

We are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation in general, and intellectual property and
securities litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict.

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “KLAC.”

The prices per share reflected in the following table represent the high and low closing prices for our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
for the periods indicated.

During the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, our Board of Directors
approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was $95.1 million. During the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30,
2008, our Board of Directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, which was declared on August 8, 2007 and will be paid on September 1, 2007 to our stockholders of record on August 20, 2007.

As of July 31, 2007, there were 758 holders of record of our common stock.



Equity Repurchase Plans

Following is a summary of stock repurchases for each month during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007:(1)

(1)

In July 1997, the Board of Directors authorized KLA-Tencor to systematically repurchase up to 17.8 million shares of its common stock in the open market. This plan was put into
place to reduce the dilution from KLA-Tencor’s employee benefit and incentive plans such as the stock option and employee stock purchase plans, and to return excess cash to the Company’s shareholders. In February 2005, the Board of
Directors authorized KLA-Tencor to repurchase up to an additional 10.0 million shares of its common stock under this repurchase plan. All such repurchased shares remain as treasury shares. In February 2007, the Board of Directors authorized
KLA-Tencor to repurchase up to an additional 10.0 million shares of its common stock under a new repurchase program (in addition to the 27.8 million shares described in the preceding sentences).

Following the conclusion of the fiscal year covered by this report, in August 2007, the Board of Directors authorized KLA-Tencor to repurchase up to an
additional 10.0 million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program (in addition to the 37.8 million shares described in the preceding paragraph).

(2)

All shares were purchased pursuant to the publicly announced repurchase programs described in footnote 1 above.

(3)

The stock repurchase programs have no expiration date. Our systematic buyback program was suspended in May 2006, and resumed in February 2007. Future repurchases of the
Company’s common stock under the Company’s repurchase programs may be effected through various different repurchase transaction structures, including isolated open market transactions or systematic repurchase plans.

(4)

In addition to the above stock repurchases, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $750.0 million of the Company’s common stock pursuant to an Accelerated
Share Repurchase program (“ASR”) in February 2007. The ASR was completed during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Under the ASR, the Company repurchased 14.0 million shares of the Company’s common
stock at an average price of $53.52 per share of which 2.0 million shares were delivered to the Company in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.



ITEM 6.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following tables
include selected consolidated summary financial data for each of our last five fiscal years. This data should be read in conjunction with Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Effective in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we implemented SFAS No. 123(R)

Share-Based Payment

. It requires us to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and
the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results
could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)

Restatements of Prior Period Consolidated Financial Statements in Previous Filings

In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 (filed on January 29, 2007) and our quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007 (filed on January 29, 2007, February 9, 2007 and May 7, 2007, respectively), we restated (1) our
consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004; (2) our selected consolidated financial data as of and for our fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002; and (3) our
unaudited quarterly financial data for the first three quarters in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and for all quarters in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. In those filings, to correct our past accounting for stock options, we
recorded total additional pre-tax, non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $375.7 million for periods from July 1, 1994 to June 30, 2007. All financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflects that restatement
and does not contain any further restatement.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES

The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these
estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of
the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company’s related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial
statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows:

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the seller’s price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—system sales, spare part
sales and service contracts. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. We also recognize revenue prior to written
acceptance from the customer, as follows:

•

When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is
recognized upon shipment;

•

When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred
based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation;

•

When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the
required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation;



•

When the customer withholds signature on our acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing
as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications;

•

When the system is damaged during transit, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer.

Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 13.5%, 4.4% and 6.6% of total revenues for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance is primarily driven by increased shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs,
and an increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues.

Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in
right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.

Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer, and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.

Service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Consulting and training revenue is recognized when the
related services are performed.

The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due
on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs.

We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales
as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.

Software is incidental to our products as determined in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-05,

Applicability of SOP 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software

. We periodically
review the software element of our systems in accordance with SOP No. 97-2 and EITF Issue No. 03-05.

Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost, and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value. We
review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis.

We review and set standard costs semi-annually at current
manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory
costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges.

We write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic
direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.



Warranty.

We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve
months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical
product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these
estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to
be larger for new product introductions as there is limited or no historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates.
Non-standard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term
period commences. See Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing
credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and
(2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, and the financial condition of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial
obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.

Stock-Based
Compensation.

Beginning July 1, 2005, we have accounted for stock-based compensation using the fair value of stock options based on a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), as clarified
by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107. We elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly, during the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2006 and 2007, we recorded stock-based compensation expense totaling the amount that would have been recognized had the fair value method been applied under SFAS No. 123 since the effective date of SFAS No. 123 for the grants
made prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, and under SFAS No. 123(R) for the grants made during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 and 2007.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair
value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the
expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility of the Company’s common stock. We determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market
conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a blended volatility. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving the expected volatility assumption.

In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position No. 123(R)-3

Transition Election
Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Award

s (“FSP 123R-3”). We have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FSP 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based
compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R). We followed paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123(R) to calculate the initial pool of excess tax benefits and to determine the subsequent impact on the Additional Paid-in-Capital (“APIC”)
pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of



employee stock-based compensation awards that were outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We have elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of
share-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and are recognizing the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs. See Note 6, “Stock-Based
Compensation” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.

Contingencies and Litigation.

We are
subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and
unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

As required by SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

goodwill is not amortized but is
subject to impairment tests annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. Purchased technology, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated
amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We completed the annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit during the
quarter ended December 31, 2006, and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

Income Taxes.

We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting
for Income Taxes

, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also
requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of
our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision
in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable.

On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an
estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax
planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results
of operations.

In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our best estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. If we ultimately determine that
payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period
in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be.



Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an Amendment
of FASB Statement No. 115

, which is effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2008. This statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified
election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

.
SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are
effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning July 1, 2008. We are evaluating the impact of the provisions of this statement on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB published FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation
of FASB Statement No. 109

which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. FIN 48
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for our Company in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2007. Any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements
of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. In addition, the adoption of
FIN 48 will result in the reclassification of certain unrecognized tax benefits from current to non-current liabilities in our statement of financial position. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of
FIN 48 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 155,

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of

SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

. These Statements permit fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. These Statements are
effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after July 1, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

KLA-Tencor Corporation is the world’s leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. Our comprehensive portfolio of products,
services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication process—from research and development to final volume production.

Revenues, income from operations, net income, cash flow from operations, and diluted earnings per share are some of the key indicators we use to monitor
our financial condition and operating performance. The following table sets forth some of the key quarterly unaudited financial information which we use to manage our business.

Industry Trends

As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. The industries we serve have
historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity. We expect that our customers’ capital spending on process control to increase over the long term. We believe that this increase in process control spending
will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography
challenges and fab process innovation. We anticipate that these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services over the coming years. The key drivers for growth in the semiconductor equipment industry in calendar year 2007 are the
transition to 65nm design nodes, the increased demand for consumer electronics, and the strength of the flash memory market.



Revenues and Gross Margin

Product revenues

Product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily as a result of a higher level of orders received due to our customers’ increased capital spending in the area of process control
and yield management. The higher level of customer spending in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was driven by our customers’ demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further
shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation.

Product revenue was relatively flat in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005.

Service revenues

Service revenues are generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time
and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. Service revenues continued to increase through the three year period disclosed in the table above as our installed base of equipment at our
customers’ sites continued to grow. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems.

Revenues by region

Revenues by region for the
periods indicated were as follows (in thousands):

A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial
portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that will continue to be the case.



Gross margin

Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products. The increase in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was
primarily due to increased revenues and savings realized from our cost reduction initiative during the fiscal year. In addition, the following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007:

•

$33.9 million for additional amortization of intangibles and fair value adjustment for inventory related to the acquisitions completed as of June 30, 2007, of
which $13.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007;

•

$4.9 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $2.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2007; and

•

An aggregate of $4.7 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payment to employees to
compensate them for lost benefits resulting from the suspension of the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which $4.7 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2007.

The decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 compared to the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2005 was primarily due to our cessation of development work related to CDSEM and stock-based compensation expense recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, which contributed 1% and 1%, respectively, to the
decrease in gross margin. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we ceased development work on the next generation equipment for CDSEM and incurred charges of $26.5 million resulting from write-offs of related
inventory and other liabilities related to the cessation of future development of CDSEM. Although we have ceased future development of CDSEM, we will continue to service previously sold equipment.

Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”)

The increase in R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily
reflects additional expenses related to the following charges recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007:

•

$17.9 million for in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) charges and amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisitions that we
completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $12.3 million was recorded in fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007;

•

$10.0 million for impairment of certain patents recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007;

•

An aggregate of $5.8 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payments to employees to
compensate them for lost benefits resulting from the suspension of the Company’s ESPP, which $5.8 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and

•

$4.3 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $2.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2007.



The increase in R&D expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 compared to the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2005 was primarily attributable to increased stock-based compensation expenses due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R).

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we recorded $16.6 million for in-process research and development charges. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which
discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends.
We determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological change in the project and the industry, among other
factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve
technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of
planning, designing, experimenting, and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we determined that we would not pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed during
fiscal year 2006 for approximately $14.0 million. Since we did not have any alternative use of these patents and we believe the fair value to be $0, the carrying value of $10.7 million was written off. The write off was recorded as $10.0 million to
R&D expense and $0.7 million to cost of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

R&D expenses include the benefit of
$12.7 million, $11.4 million and $7.9 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We expect our
R&D expenses to increase in absolute dollars over the next several years as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products.

Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our
marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers
face at future technology nodes.

Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”)



The increase in SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily reflects
additional charges recorded in SG&A as follows:

•

$56.8 million for impairment charges related to the write-down of buildings which was recorded in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007;

•

$11.3 million for severance and related benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $6.1 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2007;

•

$12.3 million for additional amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions that we completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $1.7 million is recorded
in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007;

•

$15.8 million for legal and other expenses related to the stock options investigation, shareholder litigation and related matters which was primarily recorded in
the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and

•

$8.0 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payments to employees to compensate them for
lost benefits from the suspension of the Company’s ESPP, which $8.0 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

The cumulative increase in SG&A expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was
offset in part by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to a reversal of $20.3 million in stock-based compensation expense related to our former Chief Executive Officer. In addition, certain options granted in prior years were
fully vested in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 resulting in lower levels of stock-based compensation expense

In November 2006,
as part of our long-term business plan, we decided to sell certain real estate properties owned by the Company in San Jose, California and Livermore, California. Based on the valuation of these assets, we recorded an asset impairment charge of
approximately $56.8 million, which has been included in SG&A during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. See Note 15, “Asset Impairment and Severance Charges” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

The increase in SG&A expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of stock-based
compensation expense due to implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and increased legal costs of $21.1 million attributable to accrued expenses related to the stock option investigation.

During November 2005, we announced that effective January 1, 2006, Kenneth L. Schroeder would cease to be our Chief Executive Officer and would
thereafter be employed as a Senior Advisor. The Company and Mr. Schroeder also revised his prior agreement with the Company and defined the salary, bonus payout and equity award vesting during the period of his employment as a Senior Advisor.
Effective January 1, 2006, we determined that all service conditions associated with certain prior equity awards under the terms of the revised agreement with Mr. Schroeder had been satisfied; accordingly, we recorded at that time an
additional non-cash, stock-based compensation charge of approximately $9.8 million relating to these equity awards. The above-mentioned charge is included as a component of SG&A expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. On
October 16, 2006, following the Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices, we terminated all aspects of Mr. Schroeder’s employment relationship and agreement with the Company. As a result, vesting of
Mr. Schroeder’s then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 0.9 million unvested option shares and 0.1 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the
time of termination were canceled. Accordingly, in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 we reversed approximately $20.3 million of the non-cash, stock-based compensation charge recorded in prior periods. In December 2006,
we canceled 0.6 million vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the time of termination, representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted.



Interest Income and Other, Net

Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment
and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, as well as income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The increases in interest income and other, net, in each of the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2007 and 2006, as compared to the prior fiscal year were primarily due to higher short-term interest rates. In addition, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we had an equity interest in a development stage company which we
consolidated as of March 31, 2004. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we acquired the remaining minority interest in this entity and subsequently sold certain assets of this entity and recorded a gain of $3.9 million.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income
tax rate was 22.2%, 0.4% and 24.3% in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In general, our effective income tax rate is a function of benefits realized from our Extraterritorial Income (“ETI”) exclusion,
foreign earnings taxed at different rates, research and development tax credits and tax exempt interest.

In the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, the Company reduced its total income tax reserves by $15.3 million and $79.7 million respectively. This was primarily due to expiring statutes of limitations, several tax settlements reached with various
tax authorities and reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we entered into a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to an examination
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and 2004. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we entered into a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board related to an examination for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1998
and 1999.

Our benefits for income tax related to equity awards were $34.5 million, $58.2 million and $12.1 million for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax
legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, non tax-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, amounts of tax-exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax
income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.

The statute of limitations has expired for franchise taxes in California,
the state in which the Company’s headquarters are located, through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, and the Internal Revenue Service completed an audit of the Company’s corporate tax returns for the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2003 and 2004 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Liabilities for anticipated worldwide tax audit issues have been established based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are
probable. The Company believes that adequate reserves have been provided to cover any potential additional tax assessments.

Equity Incentive Program

Our equity incentive program is a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain key employees, and
align stockholder and employee interests. The equity incentive program consists of two plans: one under which non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock, and another in which non-employee directors, officers, key
employees, consultants and all other employees may be



granted options to purchase shares of our stock, restricted stock units and other types of equity awards. For the past several years until June 30,
2006, stock options (except for the retroactively priced options which were granted primarily prior to fiscal year 2002) were generally granted at the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, with a vesting period of five years and an
exercise period not to exceed seven years (ten years for options granted prior to July 1, 2005) from the date of issuance. Restricted stock units may be granted with varying criteria such as time-based or performance-based vesting.
Substantially all of our employees that meet established performance goals and qualify as key employees participate in our main equity incentive plan. Since July 1, 2006, we have granted only restricted stock units under our equity incentive
program, except for options granted to non-employee directors as part of their regular compensation package for service through June 30, 2007.

On October 18, 2004, our stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”) which provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of our common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units to our employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors. Since the adoption of the 2004 Plan, no further grants are permitted under the 1982 Stock Option Plan or 2000
Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan. The 2004 Plan permits the issuance of up to 12.5 million shares of common stock, of which 3.3 million shares were available for grant as of June 30, 2007. Any 2004 Plan awards of restricted stock,
performance shares, performance units or deferred stock units with a per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of fair market value on the grant date shall be counted against the total number of shares issuable under the 2004 Plan as 1.8
shares for every one share subject thereto. Total options and restricted stock units outstanding under all plans as of June 30, 2007 were 19.6 million and 3.4 million, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

Effective
July 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is
measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award which is computed using a Black-Scholes option valuation model, and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The following table shows stock-based
compensation expense by type of award for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

The decrease in stock-based compensation expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as
compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to a reversal of $20.3 million in stock-based compensation expense related to the cancellation of options and restricted stock units previously held by our former Chief Executive
Officer. In addition, certain options granted in prior years were fully vested in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 resulting in lower levels of stock-based compensation expense. These decreases were offset by $9.3 million of cash
compensation related to bonuses payable to the holders of amended options to compensate them for the increase in their option exercise price.

The increase in stock-based compensation expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 is primarily due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R).

As of June 30, 2007, the unrecognized stock-based compensation balance related to stock options was $106.0 million and will be recognized over an
estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.6 years. As of June 30, 2007, the unrecognized stock-based compensation balance related to restricted stock units was $71.2 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted average
amortization period of 3.2 years.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided
by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 consisted primarily of net income of $528.1 million increased by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $109.3 million, stock-based compensation of $99.6 million and non-cash
impairment charges of $67.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $107.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $45.6 million, a decrease in deferred system profit of $24.4 million and increase in other assets of
$19.4 million.

Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 consisted primarily of net income of
$380.5 million increased by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $69.4 million, stock-based compensation of $164.7 million, tax benefit from equity awards of $31.9 million and an increase in accounts payable of $27.1 million, partially offset
by an increase in accounts receivable of $114.9 million, an increase in inventories of $87.7 million, and an increase in net deferred income tax assets of $134.4 million.

Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 consisted primarily of net income of $445.0 million increased by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $70.2 million, stock-based
compensation of $37.0 million, decrease in accounts receivable of $36.6 million and decrease in other assets and liabilities of $42.8 million partially offset by a decrease in deferred system profit of $70.8 million and an increase in net deferred
income tax assets of $53.5 million.

Investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities,
purchases of capital assets to support long-term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging technologies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we paid $521.7 million for
acquisitions completed during the fiscal year including the acquisition of certain assets of a development stage company. Also, purchases of capital assets in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 includes purchases of $29.9 million related to
our Singapore facility.

Financing activities include dividend payments to our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common
stock. Issuance of common stock provided $263.2 million, $212.7 million and $133.6 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We used $808.5 million, $221.4 million and $203.7 million in the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. The stock repurchase program was suspended in May 2006 and resumed in February 2007. The increase from fiscal year 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the
Accelerated Share Repurchase (“ASR”) program described below. This increase in our share repurchases is the primary reason for the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2007 versus June 30,
2006.



During the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, our Board of Directors also
approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and declared a dividend of $0.12 per share of our outstanding common stock. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $95.1 million,
$95.4 million and $23.6 million, respectively. Further, a dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008 was declared in August, 2007 and will be paid on
September 1, 2007 to our stockholders on record as of August 20, 2007.

In February 2007, we entered into an ASR program with a
third-party investment bank and prepaid $750.0 million to repurchase its common stock. The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the ASR was determined and adjusted based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price
of our common stock during a period following the execution of the ASR agreement, subject to a maximum price per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 we repurchased 14.0 million shares of our common stock under the ASR, of
which 2.0 million shares were delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

The shares
repurchased under the ASR decreased our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under
our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Following the conclusion of the fiscal year covered by this report, in August 2007, the Board of
Directors authorized KLA-Tencor to repurchase up to an additional 10.0 million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program.

The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2007:

We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and
promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, Letters of Credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment for goods.

The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid during the
years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006:

(1)

Discounting fees were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest and other income net.

We maintain guarantee arrangements of $27.9 million in various locations to fund customs guarantee for VAT and LC needs of its subsidiaries in Europe and
Asia. Approximately $18.4 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of June 30, 2007.

We maintain certain purchase
commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted



time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. We estimate our purchase commitment
as of June 30, 2007 to be approximately $145.5 million which are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the
amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.

We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems
during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product
performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited
or no historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services
incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 11 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.

Because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options issued by the Company were not involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing, the Company
has taken certain actions to deal with the adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of retroactively priced options. The adverse tax consequences are that retroactively priced stock options vesting after December 31, 2004
(“409A Affected Options”) subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar penalty taxes under California and other state tax laws). One such action by the Company involved offering to
amend the 409A Affected Options to increase the exercise price to the market price on the actual grant date or, if lower, the market price at the time of the amendment. The amended options are not subject to taxation under IRC Section 409A.
Under IRS regulations, these option amendments had to be completed by December 31, 2006 for anyone who was an executive officer when he or she received 409A Affected Options; the amendments for non-officers do not need to be completed until
December 31, 2007.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we accrued approximately $20.2 million payable to non-executive
holders of the amended options to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option exercise prices. The $20.2 million is payable in January 2008. Of the $20.2 million, $9.3 million was recorded as stock-based compensation expense, and the
remaining $10.9 million was recorded in common stock and capital in excess of par value in the balance sheet. The amount of these bonuses will effectively repaid to the Company if and when the options are exercised and the increased exercise price
is paid. However, there is no assurance that the options will be exercised and the employees will retain the bonuses under all circumstances. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we also recorded approximately $13.9 million to compensate
certain option holders whose employment had terminated, or who had already exercised 409A Affected Options, for the additional taxes they incurred under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar state tax laws).

Three of the Company’s option holders were subject to the December 31, 2006 deadline described above. Accordingly, in December 2006, the
Company offered to amend the 409A Affected Options held by Mr. Wallace, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and two former executive officers to increase the exercise price so that these options will not subject the option holder to a
penalty tax under IRC Section 409A. All three individuals accepted the Company’s offer. In addition, the Company agreed to pay each of the three individuals a cash bonus in January 2008 equal to the aggregate increase in the exercise
prices for his amended options. For Mr. Wallace, the amount of this bonus is $0.4 million. To account for these actions, the Company has recorded a charge of $0.3 million, net of amount reclassified from capital in excess of par, during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. We are involved in several litigation cases as described in Note 12, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these cases, and we
cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results.



Working capital decreased to $2,179.6 million as of June 30, 2007, compared to $2,594.5 million as
of June 30, 2006. This decrease is primarily due to cash payments for the ASR program and acquisitions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. As of June 30, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1,710.6 million of
cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the
semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing
cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Under our foreign-currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated
fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial
markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments
having tenors of up to 18 months. The outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows:



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign
currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2007. Actual
results may differ materially.

As of June 30, 2007, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $988.1 million,
excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents (detail of these securities is included in Note 3, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to
increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2007, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $5.1 million.

As of June 30, 2007, we had net forward contracts to sell $376.7 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 13, “Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2007, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $365.0 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange
rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $50.3 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe
that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on income or cash flows.

KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Operations and Principles of Consolidation.

KLA-Tencor Corporation (“KLA-Tencor” or the “Company”) is a global
provider of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor manufacturing and related microelectronics industries. Headquartered in San Jose, California, KLA-Tencor has subsidiaries both in the United States and in key markets
throughout the world.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of KLA-Tencor and its majority-owned subsidiaries, and
the ownership interests of minority investors are recorded as minority interests. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Management Estimates.

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

KLA-Tencor has evaluated the estimated fair value of financial instruments using
available market information and valuation methodologies as provided by the custodian. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The fair value of
KLA-Tencor’s cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these items.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities.

All highly liquid debt instruments with original or remaining maturities of less than three months at
the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities are generally classified as available-for-sale for use in current operations if required and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax,
presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices. All realized gains and losses and unrealized losses and declines in fair value that are other than
temporary are recorded in earnings in the period of occurrence. The specific identification method is used to determine the realized gains and losses on investments.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities and Other Investments.

KLA-Tencor acquires certain equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives, and to the extent these investments continue to
have strategic value, KLA-Tencor typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate the inherent market risks. Non-marketable equity securities and other investments are recorded at historical cost. Non-marketable equity securities and other
investments are included in “Other assets” on the balance sheet. Non-marketable equity securities are subject to a periodic impairment review; however, there are no open-market valuations, and the impairment analysis requires significant
judgment. This analysis includes assessment of the investee’s financial condition, the business outlook for its products and technology, its projected results and cash flow, the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the
impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by KLA-Tencor or others.

Variable Interest Entities.

FASB Interpretation
No. (“FIN”) 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51

, requires that if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities, and results of
operations of the variable interest entity should be included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. KLA-Tencor has concluded that none of the Company’s equity investments are material to the Company’s financial position
and do not require consolidation as they are either not variable interest entities or, in the event they are variable interest entities, that KLA-Tencor is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or
market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value. KLA-Tencor reviews the adequacy of its inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. The Company
reviews and sets standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. The Company’s manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending
over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges. The Company writes down
product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on past usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic
direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

A majority of the trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers
throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon the
Company’s assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is
based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally thirty to thirty-five years for buildings, ten to fifteen years for leasehold improvements, five to seven years for furniture and fixtures, and two
to five years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method over the shorter of the life of the related asset or the term of the underlying lease. Construction in process does not depreciate until the
assets are placed in service. Depreciation expense for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $58.3 million, $52.4 million and $48.0 million, respectively.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

As required by SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, goodwill is not amortized but is
subject to impairment tests annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. Purchased technology, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated
amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. The Company completed its annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit
during the quarter ended December 31, 2006, and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter
of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

KLA-Tencor evaluates the carrying value of its
long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived

Assets

. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset including disposition, is less than the carrying value of the asset. Such an impairment charge would be measured as the
excess of the asset over its fair value.

Software Development Costs.

KLA-Tencor capitalizes certain internal and external costs
incurred to acquire and create internal use software in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 98-1,



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

. Capitalized software is included in property and equipment when
development is complete and is depreciated over three to five years when placed in service.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

Financial
instruments that potentially subject KLA-Tencor to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term and non-current marketable securities, trade accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments used
in hedging activities. KLA-Tencor invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as, but not limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate and municipal bonds, United States Treasury and agency securities, equity securities and, by policy,
limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. KLA-Tencor has not experienced any material credit losses on its investments.

A majority of KLA-Tencor’s trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers located throughout the world,
with a majority located in Asia. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is considered to be limited due to the Company’s customer base and the diversity of its geographic sales areas. KLA-Tencor performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral to secure accounts receivable. KLA-Tencor maintains an allowance for potential credit losses based upon expected collectibility of all accounts receivable.
In addition, KLA-Tencor may utilize letters of credit or non-recourse factoring to mitigate credit risk when considered appropriate.

KLA-Tencor is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the foreign exchange contracts used in hedging activities and in certain factoring transactions. These counterparties are large international financial
institutions and to date no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations under such contracts.

Foreign Currency.

The functional currencies of KLA-Tencor’s significant foreign subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of the foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars at current period end exchange
rates, and revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period. The gains and losses from foreign currency translation of these subsidiaries’ financial statements are recorded directly
into a separate component of stockholders’ equity under the caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

KLA-Tencor’s subsidiaries in Israel and Singapore use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period,
except for non-monetary assets, such as inventories and property, plant and equipment that are translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to
those balance sheet items that are translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

KLA-Tencor uses financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and currency options, to hedge a
portion of, but not all, existing and forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within twelve months. The purpose of KLA-Tencor’s foreign currency program is to manage the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on
certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items. KLA-Tencor
believes these financial instruments do not subject the Company to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. KLA-Tencor does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

All of KLA-Tencor’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon
quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative
is ineffective, the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or loss on these hedges is
recorded immediately in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

Warranty.

KLA-Tencor provides standard warranty coverage on its systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. KLA-Tencor accounts for the estimated warranty cost as a
charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, KLA-Tencor calculates the average service hours and parts expense
per system and applies the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. KLA-Tencor updates these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in
those cases KLA-Tencor adjusts warranty accruals accordingly (see Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies”).

Revenue
Recognition.

KLA-Tencor recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the seller’s price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
KLA-Tencor derives revenue from three sources—system sales, spare part sales and service contracts. KLA-Tencor recognizes revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to
predetermined specifications. KLA-Tencor also recognizes revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:

•

When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is
recognized on shipment;

•

When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred;

•

When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that it meets all of the required
acceptance criteria upon shipment, a portion of revenue can be recognized at the time of shipment. Revenue recognized upon shipment is exclusive of the amount allocable to the installation element. Revenue attributable to the installation element
represents the fair value of installation;

•

When the customer withholds signature on our acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing
as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications;

•

When the system is damaged during transit, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer.

Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 13.5%, 4.4% and 6.6% of total revenues for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance is primarily driven by increased shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs,
and an increase in the revenue derived from systems with perfunctory installation. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

KLA-Tencor also allows for multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a
sales contract are not delivered and accepted at the same time. In such cases, KLA-Tencor defers the relative fair value of the undelivered element until that element is delivered to and accepted by the customer. To be considered a separate element,
the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting and fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis; (b) there is objective and reliable evidence of
the fair value of the undelivered item(s); and (c) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the
control of the Company. If the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer.

Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable
is probable.

Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. If maintenance is
included in an arrangement, which includes a software license agreement, amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week
coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are
performed, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection
with subsequent purchases. The Company estimates the value of the trade-in right and reduces the revenue of the initial sale.

The deferred
system profit balance as of June 30, 2007 and 2006 was $201.7 million and $226.1 million, respectively, and equals the amount of system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment but deferred, less applicable product and warranty costs.
KLA-Tencor also defers the fair value of extended service contracts and of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. The unearned revenue balance was $99.3 and $80.5 million as of June 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Research and Development
Costs.

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Strategic Development Agreements.

Gross engineering,
research and development expenses were partially offset by $12.7 million, $11.4 million and $7.9 million in external funding received under certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants in the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Shipping and Handling Costs.

Shipping and handling costs are included as a
component of cost of sales.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans.

Prior to July 1, 2005, the Company applied
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

and its related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, a non-cash, stock-based compensation expense was recognized for any options for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date. The



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

charge for the options with an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date was equal to the number of options multiplied by the difference
between the exercise price and the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. That expense was amortized over the vesting period of the option.

Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock purchase plan and employee stock
option plans under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123.

Beginning July 1, 2005, the Company has accounted for stock-based compensation using the fair
value of stock options based on Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107. The Company elected to adopt
the modified prospective application method as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense totaling the amount that would have been recognized
had the fair value method been applied under SFAS No. 123 since the effective date of SFAS No. 123 for the grants made before the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, and under SFAS No. 123(R) for the grants made during the fiscal
years ended June 30, 2006 and 2007.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the
implied volatility of the Company’s common stock. The Company determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a blended volatility. Prior to the adoption of SFAS
No. 123(R), the Company used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving the expected volatility assumption.

In
November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 123(R)-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Award

s (“FSP 123R-3”). The Company has elected not to adopt the
alternative transition method provided in FSP 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R). The Company followed paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123(R) to calculate the initial pool of excess tax
benefits and to determine the subsequent impact on the Additional Paid-in-Capital (“APIC”) pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R). The Company has elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of share-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and recognizes the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period
in which the taxable event occurs.

Advertising Expenses.

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $4.9 million, $5.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively.

Income Taxes.

KLA-Tencor accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences
between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized. KLA-Tencor has determined that the Company’s future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of its deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in its ability to recover the Company’s deferred tax assets,
KLA-Tencor could be required to record a valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to the Company’s tax provision in the period in which the Company determined that the recovery was not
probable.

In addition, the calculation of the Company’s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. KLA-Tencor recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our best estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. If the Company
ultimately determines that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the Company will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which the Company determines that the liability is no longer necessary. KLA-Tencor will
record an additional charge in the Company’s provision for taxes in the period in which the Company determines that the recorded tax liability is less than the Company expects the ultimate assessment to be.

Earnings Per Share.

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares
of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the
treasury stock method, which includes consideration of stock-based compensation required by SFAS No. 123(R) and SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per Share

.

Contingencies and Litigation.

The Company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such
contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs
expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 11, “Commitments and
Contingencies” for a detailed description.

Reclassifications.

The Company has reclassified certain prior period balances to
conform to the correct presentation. These reclassifications did not impact any prior amounts of reported total assets, total liabilities, stockholders’ equity, results of operations or cash flows.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

, which is effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2008. This statement permits an entity to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings. The
Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning July 1, 2008. The Company is evaluating the impact of the provisions of
this statement on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB published FIN 48 ,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS
No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2007. Any differences between the
amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. In
addition, the adoption of FIN 48 will result in the reclassification of certain unrecognized tax benefits from current to non-current liabilities in the Company’s statement of financial position. The Company is currently evaluating the
potential impact of the implementation of FIN 48 on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February
2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

. This Statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. This Statement
is effective for the Company for all financial instruments acquired or issued after July 1, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Restatements of Prior Period Consolidated Financial Statements in Previous Filings.

On September 28,
2006, the Company announced that it would have to restate previously issued financial statements to correct for past accounting for stock options. As a result of an investigation of the Company’s historical stock option practices by a Special
Committee appointed by the Company’s Board of Directors, it was discovered that certain stock options, primarily those granted from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2002, had been retroactively priced for all employees who received these
grants. In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 (filed on January 29, 2007) and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, December 31,
2006 and March 31, 2007 (filed on January 29, 2007, February 9, 2007 and May 7, 2007, respectively), the Company restated (1) its consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and
2004; (2) its selected consolidated financial data as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002; and (3) its unaudited quarterly financial data for the first three quarters in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2006 and for all quarters in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. All financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflects the restatement and does not contain any further restatement.

KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

KLA-Tencor’s investment portfolio consists of both corporate and government securities that have
a maximum maturity of 10 years. The longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market
unrealized loss. All unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and bond yields. The Company has the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity. The following table summarizes the fair value and gross
unrealized losses of its investments, aggregated by investment instrument and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2007:

The contractual maturities of securities classified as available-for-sale as of
June 30, 2007, other than corporate equity securities, regardless of the consolidated balance sheet classification, are as follows:

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to
call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Net realized losses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were approximately $1.6 million, $8.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively.

NOTE 4—GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

The following table presents goodwill balances and the movements during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006:



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. The carrying value of goodwill was allocated to KLA-Tencor’s reporting units pursuant to SFAS No. 142. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, KLA-Tencor completed its
annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2006, and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to
the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Refer to Note 5, “Business Combinations” for a detailed description of acquisitions completed in the fiscal year ended June 30,
2007.

Adjustments to goodwill during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 resulted from the purchase of the remaining minority
interest in a development stage company which was consolidated as of March 31, 2004. See Note 5, “Business Combinations” for a detailed description.

Other Intangible Assets

The components of other intangible assets as of June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006 were as
follows:

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, it was determined that the Company would not
pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 for approximately $14.0 million. Since the Company did not have any alternative use of these patents and the Company believes the fair
value to be $0, the carrying value of $10.7 million was written off. This write off was recorded as $10.0 million to R&D expense and $0.7 million to cost of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, amortization expense for other intangible assets was $29.4 million, $4.5 million and $3.3
million, respectively. Based on intangible assets recorded as of June 30, 2007, and assuming no subsequent additions to, or impairment of the underlying assets, the remaining estimated annual amortization expense is expected to be as follows
(in thousands):

NOTE 5—BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

All of the Company’s qualifying business combinations have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Consideration includes the
cash paid and the value of options assumed, less any cash acquired, and excludes contingent employee compensation payable in cash. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company accounted for the intrinsic value of stock options assumed
related to future services as deferred stock-based compensation within stockholders’ equity.

During the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of the following businesses for net cash consideration of approximately $509.7 million (net cash consideration for ADE Corporation was $390.2 million) primarily to expand the Company’s
product portfolio:

The following table summarizes the aggregate estimated fair values of the net assets acquired at
the applicable date of acquisition for the above companies:

(1)

$17.1 million of accrued restructuring created as a result of the Company’s acquisitions during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 has been included in liabilities
assumed. The Company formulated the restructuring plans on the completion date of the acquisitions. At June 30, 2007, the balance of accrued restructuring is $17.0 million.

In addition to the acquisition transactions listed above, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the Company acquired a development stage company
for $15.0 million of which $3.0 million is payable upon achievement of certain milestones over the following two years. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase of assets primarily consisting of in-process research and development
(“IPR&D”) and certain patents.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The fair value of the purchased IPR&D and identified intangibles was determined using the income
approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included; the utilization of core technology; the complexity, cost and time to
complete development; any alternative future use or current technological feasibility; and the stage of completion. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology,
relevant market sizes and industry trends. The Company determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological
change in the project and the industry, among other factors. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination.

The Company expensed IPR&D of $16.6 million upon the completion of the acquisitions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 in connection with
acquired intellectual property for which technological feasibility has not been established and no future alternative uses exist.

The
Company currently has not identified any material pre-merger contingencies where a liability is probable and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. If information becomes available prior to the end of the purchase price allocation
period, which would indicate that it is probable that such events had occurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, such items will be included in the purchase price allocation.

Pro forma earnings information has not been presented because the effect of the acquisitions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was not material
either on an individual or an aggregate basis.

In connection with the acquisitions completed during the fiscal year ended June 30,
2005, KLA-Tencor became subject to a $9.1 million contingent cash payment based on the continued employment of certain employees over two years. The contingency is accounted for as compensation expense over the contingent employment period. During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, $5.4 million of this amount was paid, and the remaining $3.7 million was paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

The Company had an equity interest in a development stage company which was consolidated as of March 31, 2006. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the Company purchased the remaining minority
interest and assumed 100% ownership in this entity. Subsequently, the Company sold certain assets of this entity to an unrelated third party and recorded a gain of $3.9 million in other income in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

NOTE 6—STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Effective July 1, 2005, KLA-Tencor adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes
accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service
period. The Company previously applied APB Opinion No. 25,

Stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 includes a $20.3 million reversal of stock-based compensation charges related to the cancellation of
stock options and restricted stock units held by the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and $9.3 million of cash compensation related to bonuses payable to the holders of the amended options to compensate them for the increase in their
option exercise prices. As of June 30, 2007, the unrecognized stock-based compensation balance was $177.2 million.

Stock Options

Stock-based compensation expense related to options for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is net of a $16.2 million reversal of stock-based compensation charges related to
the cancellation of stock options held by the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer.

As of June 30, 2007, the
unrecognized stock-based compensation balance related to stock options was $106.0 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.6 years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Valuation Assumptions

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company reassessed its valuation technique and related assumptions. The Company estimates the
fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), SEC SAB No. 107 and the Company’s prior period pro forma disclosures of net earnings, including stock-based
compensation (determined under a fair value method as prescribed by SFAS No. 123). The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the straight-line attribution approach
with the following weighted-average assumptions:

SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied
volatility of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s computation of expected volatility is based on market-based implied volatility from traded options on the Company’s stock. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the
Company used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving its expected volatility assumption. The Company determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than
a blended volatility.

Equity Incentive Program

The Company’s equity incentive program is a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain key employees, and align stockholder and employee interests. The equity incentive
program consists of two plans: one under which non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock, and another in which non-employee directors, officers, key employees, consultants and all other employees
may be granted options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock, restricted stock units and other types of equity awards. For the past several years until June 30, 2006, stock options (except for the retroactively priced options which
were granted primarily prior to fiscal year ended June 30, 2002) were generally granted at the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, with a vesting period of five years and an exercise period not to exceed seven
years (ten years for options granted prior to July 1, 2005) from the date of issuance. Restricted stock units may be granted with varying criteria such as time-based or performance-based vesting. Substantially all of the Company’s
employees that meet established performance goals and qualify as key employees participate in its main equity incentive plan. Since July 1, 2006, the Company has granted only restricted stock units under its equity incentive program, except for
options granted to non-employee directors as part of their regular compensation package for service through June 30, 2007.



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

On October 18, 2004, our stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004
Plan”) which provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of our common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units to our employees, consultants and members of our
Board of Directors. Since the adoption of the 2004 Plan, no further grants are permitted under the 1982 Stock Option Plan or 2000 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan. The 2004 Plan permits the issuance of up to 12.5 million shares of common stock,
of which 3.3 million shares were available for grant as of June 30, 2007. Any 2004 Plan awards of restricted stock, performance shares, performance units or deferred stock units with a per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of
fair market value on the grant date shall be counted against the total number of shares issuable under the plan as 1.8 shares for every one share subject thereto. Total options outstanding under all plans as of June 30, 2007 was
19.6 million.

The following table summarizes the combined activity under the equity incentive plans for the indicated periods:

(1)

Employees received stock options totaling 2.0 million shares of common stock as an advance on their fiscal year 2006 stock option grants in the first quarter of the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2005. The grant was equivalent to 50% of the employee’s fiscal year 2005 stock option grant. These advanced grant options vest on a six (6) year schedule with 20% of the option shares vesting upon completion of two
(2) years of service and the remaining 80% of the option shares vesting in a series of forty-eight (48) successive equal monthly installments upon completion of each additional month of continuous service over the remainder of the vesting
term.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(2)

Any 2004 Plan awards of restricted stock, performance shares, performance units or deferred stock units with a per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of fair market value
on the grant date shall be counted against the total number of shares issuable under the 2004 Plan as 1.8 shares for every one share subject thereto.

The weighted average grant date fair value of options, as determined under SFAS No. 123(R), granted during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $11.01, $14.17 and $22.33 per share,
respectively. As of June 30, 2007, 13.1 million options were exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $41.16 and weighted-average remaining contractual term of 5 years. The aggregate intrinsic value for the options exercisable
as of June 30, 2007 was $180.9 million.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal years ended June 30,
2007, 2006 and 2005 was $111.4 million, $130.2 million, and $69.9 million, respectively. The total cash received from employees as a result of employee stock option exercises during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
approximately $238.4 million, $176.4 million, and $97.6 million, respectively. In connection with these exercises, the tax benefits realized by the Company for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $39.5 million, $46.6
million and $25.2 million, respectively.

The Company settles employee stock option exercises with newly issued common shares.

Restricted Stock Units

The
following table shows the number of restricted stock units granted, grant-date fair value, and stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

(1)

Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units for the year ended June 30, 2007 is net of a $4.1 million reversal of stock-based compensation charges
related to the cancellation of restricted stock units held by the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer.

Beginning
in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the restricted stock units generally vest in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. Prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the restricted stock
units generally vested in two equal installments over four or five years from the anniversary date of the grant. The value of the restricted stock units was based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of award.
The restricted stock units were awarded under the Company’s 2004 Plan and each unit will entitle the recipient to one share of common stock when the applicable vesting requirements for that unit are satisfied. However, for each share actually
issued under the awarded units, the share reserve under the 2004 Plan will be reduced by 1.8 shares, as provided under the terms of the 2004 Plan.

As of June 30, 2007, the unrecognized stock-based compensation balance related to restricted stock units was $71.2 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 3.2 years. Additionally, the
number of restricted stock awards outstanding as of June 30, 2007 was 3.4 million.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

KLA-Tencor’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) provides that eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their eligible earnings
toward the semi-annual purchase of KLA-Tencor’s common stock. The ESPP is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The employee’s purchase price is derived from a formula based on the fair market value of the common
stock at the time of enrollment into the offering period versus the fair market value on the date of purchase. Offering periods are generally two years in length. On September 28, 2006, the ESPP was suspended due to the ongoing stock option
investigation, and accordingly there were no shares purchased under the ESPP during the six months ended December 31, 2006. After filing the Company’s Annual Report on January 29, 2007 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, approximately 0.3 million shares were purchased under the ESPP on February 1, 2007.

The compensation cost in connection with the ESPP in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 was $12.0 million and $16.2 million,
respectively, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). The total cash received from employees for the issuance of shares under the ESPP was approximately $24.9 million and $36.3 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. As the ESPP was non-compensatory under APB Opinion No. 25, no compensation expense was recorded in connection with the plan in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
employees purchased 0.7 million, 1.0 million, and 1.1 million shares issued at a weighted-average fair value of $35.68, $36.21 and $34.43, respectively. In connection with the disqualifying dispositions of shares purchased under the
ESPP, the Company realized the tax benefits of $1.3 million, $1.5 million, and $1.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The ESPP shares are replenished annually on the first day of each fiscal year by virtue of an evergreen provision. The provision allows for share replenishment equal to the lesser of 2.0 million shares or the
number of shares which KLA-Tencor estimates will be required to issue under the ESPP during the forthcoming fiscal year. As of June 30, 2007, a total of 1.1 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP.

On October 12, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved an alternative financial benefit
consisting of a cash payment to all employees below the vice president level who had been active participants in the ESPP before it was temporarily suspended on September 28, 2006. The alternative financial benefit is intended to compensate
such employees for the estimated financial benefit they would have realized had the ESPP continued in operation after September 28, 2006 and until December 31, 2006. On January 24, 2007, the Compensation Committee extended this
alternative financial benefit into calendar year 2007 to cover the period until the ESPP suspension ended. The Company recorded approximately $4.6 million for the alternative financial benefit during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as a
component of stock-based compensation expense.

Former Chief Executive Officer Agreement and Termination

During November 2005, the Company announced that effective January 1, 2006, Kenneth L. Schroeder would cease to be its Chief Executive Officer and
would thereafter be employed as a Senior Advisor. The Company and Mr. Schroeder also revised his prior agreement with the Company and defined the salary, bonus payout and equity award vesting during the period of his employment as a Senior
Advisor. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company determined that all service conditions associated with certain prior equity awards under the terms of the revised agreement with Mr. Schroeder had been satisfied; and accordingly, the Company
recorded at that time an additional non-cash, stock-based compensation charge of approximately $9.8 million relating to these equity awards. The above mentioned charge is included as a component of Selling, General and Administrative
(“SG&A”) expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. On October 16, 2006, following



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the Special Committee investigation of the Company’s historical stock option practices, the Company terminated all aspects of Mr. Schroeder’s
employment relationship and agreement with the Company. As a result, vesting of Mr. Schroeder’s then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 0.9 million unvested option shares and
0.1 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the time of termination were canceled. Accordingly, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 the Company reversed $20.3 million of the non-cash, stock-based
compensation charges that had been recorded in prior periods related to unvested option shares and restricted stock award shares. In December 2006, the Company also canceled 0.6 million vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the
time of termination, representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted.

IRC
Section 409A Affected Options

Because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options issued by the Company were not
involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing, the Company has taken certain actions to deal with the adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of retroactively priced options. The adverse tax consequences are that retroactively
priced stock options vesting after December 31, 2004 (“409A Affected Options”) subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar penalty taxes under California and other state tax
laws). One such action by the Company involved offering to amend the 409A Affected Options to increase the exercise price to the market price on the actual grant date or, if lower, the market price at the time of the amendment. The amended options
would not be subject to taxation under IRC Section 409A. Under IRS regulations, these option amendments had to be completed by December 31, 2006 for anyone who was an executive officer when he or she received 409A Affected Options; the
amendments for non-officers could not be offered until after the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 were filed and do
not need to be completed until December 31, 2007.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the Company accrued approximately
$20.2 million payable to non-executive holders of the amended options to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option exercise price. The $20.2 million is payable in January 2008. Of the $20.2 million, $9.3 million was recorded as
stock-based compensation expense, and the remaining $10.9 million was recorded in common stock and capital in excess of par value in the balance sheet. The amount of these bonuses would be effectively repaid to the Company if and when the options
are exercised and the increased exercise price is paid. However, there is no assurance that the options will be exercised and the employees will retain the bonuses under all circumstances. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the Company
has also recorded approximately $13.9 million to compensate certain option holders whose employment terminated or who had already exercised 409A Affected Options for the additional taxes they incur under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable,
similar state tax laws).

Three of the Company’s option holders were subject to the December 31, 2006 deadline described above.
Accordingly, in December 2006, the Company offered to amend the 409A Affected Options held by Mr. Wallace, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and two former executive officers to increase the exercise price so that these options will
not subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A. All three individuals accepted the Company’s offer. In addition, the Company agreed to pay each of the three individuals a cash bonus in January 2008 equal to the
aggregate increase in the exercise prices for his amended options. For Mr. Wallace, the amount of this bonus is $0.4 million. To account for these actions, the Company has recorded a charge of $0.3 million, net of amount reclassified from
capital in excess of par, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

With respect to certain individuals whose options were canceled
or re-priced by the Company following the Special Committee investigation, no bonuses of the type described above will be paid.

Other actions related to executive stock options

On October 16, 2006, Kenneth Levy, Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, retired as a director and employee, and was named
Chairman Emeritus by our Board of Directors. Mr. Levy entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release with the Company under which Mr. Levy’s outstanding retroactively priced stock options have been re-priced by increasing the
exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. Under SFAS No. 123(R), no incremental charge was recognized in the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Mr. Levy was the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer from 1975 until mid-1999 (with the exception of mid-1997 to mid-1998), was a member of the Company’s Board of Directors from 1975 until his retirement, was Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1999
until his retirement, and was a member of the Company’s Stock Option Committee from 1994 until use of that committee was suspended in the fall of 2006.

Also on October 16, 2006, Stuart J. Nichols, Vice President and General Counsel, resigned. Mr. Nichols entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release with the Company under which
Mr. Nichols’ outstanding retroactively priced stock options have been re-priced by increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. Under SFAS No. 123(R), no incremental charge was
recognized in the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

On December 21, 2006, Jon D. Tompkins resigned
as a director of the Company, and we agreed to modify the outstanding options held by Mr. Tompkins (all of which were fully vested) to extend the post-termination exercisability period to December 31, 2007, which is the last day of the
calendar year in which those options would have terminated in the absence of such extension. Mr. Tompkins, the Chief Executive Officer of Tencor Instruments before its merger into the Company in mid-1997, was the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer from mid-1997 to mid-1998, was a member of the Company’s stock option committee from mid-1997 until mid-1999, and was a member of the Company’s Board of Directors from mid-1997 until his resignation.

Although the Board of Directors concluded that John H. Kispert, our President and Chief Operating Officer, was not involved in and was not aware of the
improper stock option practices, based on the Special Committee’s recommendation, his outstanding retroactively priced options have been re-priced because he served as Chief Financial Officer during part of the period in question. This
re-pricing involved increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. Under SFAS No. 123(R), no incremental charge was recognized in the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2007.

NOTE 7—STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In July 1997, the Board of Directors authorized KLA-Tencor to systematically repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market. This plan was put into place to reduce the dilution from KLA-Tencor’s employee benefit and incentive
plans such as the stock option and employee stock purchase plans, and to return excess cash to the Company’s shareholders. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997 through June 30, 2007 the Board of Directors had authorized
KLA-Tencor to repurchase a total of 37.8 million shares, including 10.0 million shares authorized in February 2005, and an additional 10.0 million shares authorized in February 2007. The Company’s systematic buyback program was
suspended in May 2006, and resumed in February 2007. We account for repurchased common stock under the cost method and include such treasury stock as a component of our common shareholders’ equity.

In addition, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $750.0 million of the Company’s common stock pursuant to an Accelerated Share
Repurchase program (“ASR”) in February 2007. The Company entered into the ASR with a third-party investment bank and prepaid $750.0 million to repurchase its common stock. The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased
through the ASR was determined and



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

adjusted based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during a period following the execution of the ASR
agreement, subject to a maximum price per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 the Company received approximately 14.0 million shares under the ASR.

The payment of $750.0 million was included in the cash flows from financing activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The
shares received were multiplied by the closing stock price on the date of receipt to determine the cost of repurchase. The Company’s outstanding shares decreases as shares are physically received under the Company’s repurchase program,
including the ASR. Diluted net income per share increased by $0.05 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, due to the reduction of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period as a result of the ASR.

Share repurchases for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:

As discussed in Note 17, “Subsequent Events,” during August 2007, the Company’s
Board of Directors approved the repurchase of an additional 10.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock under the Company’s repurchase program.

NOTE 8—EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number
of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share
by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of stock-based compensation required by SFAS No. 123(R),

During the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, the Company’s Board of
Directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $95.1 million, $95.3 million, and $23.6 million, respectively.

As discussed in Note 17, “Subsequent Events,” on August 8, 2007, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share to
be paid on September 1, 2007 to stockholders of record on August 20, 2007.

NOTE 9—EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

KLA-Tencor has a profit sharing program for eligible employees, which distributes on a quarterly basis, a percentage of pre-tax profits. In addition,
KLA-Tencor has an employee savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. KLA-Tencor matches up to a maximum of $3,000 or 50% of the first $6,000 of an eligible employee’s
contribution. The total charge to operations under the profit sharing and 401(k) programs aggregated $19.0 million, $17.0 million and $16.0 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. KLA-Tencor has no defined
benefit plans in the United States. In addition to the profit sharing plan and the United States employee saving plan, several of KLA-Tencor’s foreign subsidiaries have retirement plans for their full-time employees, several of which are
defined benefit plans. Consistent with the requirements of local law, the Company deposits funds for certain of these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and/or accrues for the unfunded portion
of the obligation. The assumptions used in calculating the obligation for the foreign plans depend on the local economic environment.

KLA-
Tencor adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),

effective June 30, 2007. Upon adoption, SFAS 158
requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined pension and postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability in its statement of financial position with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive
income. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position. The benefit obligations and related assets under the Company’s plans have been
measured as of June 30, 2007.

weighted-average assumptions used is provided in the following tables:

Executive Savings Plan

KLA-Tencor has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan whereby certain executives may defer a portion of their salary and bonus. Participants are credited with returns based on their allocation of their account
balances among mutual funds. KLA-Tencor controls the investment of these funds and the participants remain general creditors of KLA-Tencor. Distributions from the plan commence the quarter following a participant’s retirement or termination of
employment. As of June 30, 2007, KLA-Tencor had a deferred compensation liability under the plan of $154.5 million included as a component of other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The significant components of deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

As of June 30, 2007, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss
(“NOL”) carry-forwards of approximately $85.2 million and $46.1 million, respectively. The Company also had U.S. federal and state tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $0.6 million and $29.7 million, respectively. The U.S. net
operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2017 through 2027. The utilization of NOLs created by acquired companies is subject to annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
However, it is not expected that such annual limitation will impair the realization of these NOLs. If not utilized, the federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2017 and state NOLs will begin to expire in 2010. Certain state credits in the amount of
$2.1 million will expire at various dates beginning in 2008 through 2021. The remaining state credits of $27.6 million will be carried over indefinitely.

The reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to KLA-Tencor’s effective income tax rate is as follows:



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Undistributed earnings of KLA-Tencor’s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $406.6
million as of June 30, 2007, of which approximately $375.7 million are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon. Upon repatriation of those
earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, KLA-Tencor would be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credit) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of
unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. KLA-Tencor’s consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related liability on amounts that
maybe repatriated.

In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, KLA-Tencor reduced its total income tax reserves by $15.3
million and $79.7 million, respectively. This was primarily due to expiring statutes of limitations, several tax settlements reached with various tax authorities and reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various
jurisdictions. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, KLA-Tencor entered into a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to an examination for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and 2004. In the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2007, KLA-Tencor entered into a settlement with California Franchise Tax Board related to an examination for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1998 and 1999.

KLA-Tencor benefits from several tax holidays in Israel and Singapore where it manufactures certain of its products. These tax holidays are on approved
investments and are scheduled to expire at varying times within the next three to nine years. The Company is in compliance with all the terms and conditions of the tax holidays. The net impact of these tax holidays was to decrease the Company’s
tax expense by approximately $13.6 million, $5.0 million and $7.6 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Factoring.

KLA-Tencor has agreements with financial institutions to sell
certain of its trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. KLA-Tencor does not believe it is at risk for any material losses as a result of these agreements. In addition, from time to time KLA-Tencor will discount without
recourse Letters of Credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment for goods.

The following table shows total receivables
sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006:

The following is a schedule of operating lease payments (in thousands):

Purchase Commitments.

KLA-Tencor maintains certain open inventory purchase commitments with
its suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. KLA-Tencor’s liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast
time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. The Company’s open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $145.5 million as of June 30, 2007 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based
upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for
potential cancellation penalties.

Guarantees.

KLA-Tencor provides standard warranty coverage on its systems for twelve months,
providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. KLA-Tencor accounts for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to cost of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical
product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, KLA-Tencor calculates the average service hours and parts expense per system and applies the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge.
KLA-Tencor updates these estimated charges periodically. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases KLA-Tencor adjusts warranty accruals accordingly.

The following table provides the changes in the product warranty accrual for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands):

Subject to certain limitations, KLA-Tencor indemnifies its current and former officers and
directors for certain events or occurrences. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments KLA-Tencor could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited, the Company believes the fair value of this liability, to
the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve it has established for currently pending legal proceedings.

KLA-Tencor is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and



KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

license agreements or the sale of assets, under which the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of
warranties, representations and covenants related to such matters as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these
circumstances, payment by the Company is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with the Company pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows the Company to challenge the other
party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, the Company’s obligations under these
agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at the Company’s option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, the Company may have
recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by the Company.

It is not possible to predict the maximum
potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the
Company under these agreements have not had a material effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company maintains guarantee arrangements of $27.9 million in various locations to fund customs guarantee for VAT and letter of credit needs of its subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. Approximately $18.4 million was outstanding under these
arrangements as of June 30, 2007.

NOTE 12—LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL MATTERS

Restatements of Prior Period Consolidated Financial Statements in Previous Filings.

On September 28, 2006, the Company announced that it would
have to restate previously issued financial statements to correct for past accounting for stock options. As a result of the Special Committee investigation, it was discovered that certain stock options, primarily those granted from July 1, 1997
to June 30, 2002, had been retroactively priced for all employees who received these grants. In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 (filed on January 29, 2007) and the quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007 (filed on January 29, 2007, February 9, 2007 and May 7, 2007, respectively), the Company restated
(1) consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004; (2) selected consolidated financial data as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002; and
(3) unaudited quarterly financial data for the first three quarters in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and for all quarters in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. All financial information included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K reflects the restatement and does not contain any further restatement.

Government Inquiries and SEC Settlement Relating to
Historical Stock Option Practices.

On May 23, 2006, the Company received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office requesting information relating to our past stock option grants and related accounting matters. Also on
May 23, 2006, the Company received a letter from the SEC making an informal inquiry and request for information on the same subject matters. The Company learned on February 2, 2007 that the SEC had opened a formal investigation into these
matters. The Company cooperated fully with the SEC investigation. On July 25, 2007, the Company announced that it had reached a settlement with the SEC by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the
reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement resolves completely the SEC investigation into the Company’s historical stock option granting practices. KLA-Tencor was not charged by
the SEC with fraud; nor was the Company required to pay any civil penalty, fine, or money damages as part of the settlement.

The
Company is cooperating fully with the USAO’s continuing inquiry and intends to continue to do so. This inquiry may require it to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other

expenses, and could result in criminal actions seeking, among other things, injunctions against the Company and the payment of significant fines and
penalties by the Company, which may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flow.

The Company has also responded to inquiries
from the U.S. Department of Labor, which is conducting an examination of our 401(k) Savings Plan prompted by our stock option issues. The Company is cooperating fully with this examination and intend to continue to do so.

The Company cannot predict how long it will take to or how much more time and resources it will have to expend to resolve these government inquiries, nor
can it predict the outcome of these inquiries. Also, there can be no assurance that other inquiries, investigations or actions will not be started by other United States federal or state regulatory agencies or by foreign governmental agencies.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices.

Beginning on May 22, 2006, several persons
and entities identifying themselves as shareholders of KLA-Tencor filed derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the Company against various of the Company’s current and former directors and officers
relating to its accounting for stock options issued from 1994 to the present. The complaints in these actions allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and other obligations to the Company and violated state and federal
securities laws in connection with the Company’s historical stock option granting process, its accounting for past stock options, and historical sales of stock by the individual defendants. Three substantially similar actions are pending, one
in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (which consists of three separate lawsuits consolidated in one action); one in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County; and one in the Delaware Chancery Court.

The plaintiffs in the derivative actions have asserted claims for violations of Sections 10(b) (including Rule 10b-5 thereunder),
14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting such breach, negligence, misappropriation of information, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets,
breach of contract, constructive fraud, rescission, and violations of California Corporations Code section 25402, as well as a claim for an accounting of all stock option grants made to the named defendants. KLA-Tencor is named as a nominal
defendant in these actions. On behalf of KLA-Tencor, the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and other relief against the named defendants. The plaintiffs are James Ziolkowski, Mark Ziering, Alaska Electrical Pension Fund, Jeffrey Rabin, and
Benjamin Langford. The individual named defendants are current directors and officers Edward W. Barnholt, H. Raymond Bingham, Robert T. Bond, Jeffrey L. Hall, Stephen P. Kaufman, John H. Kispert, Lida Urbanek and Richard P. Wallace; and former
directors and officers Robert J. Boehlke, Leo Chamberlain, Gary E. Dickerson, Richard J. Elkus, Jr., Dennis J. Fortino, Kenneth Levy, Michael E. Marks, Stuart J. Nichols, Arthur P. Schnitzer, Kenneth L. Schroeder and Jon D. Tompkins. Current
director David C. Wang and former director Dean O. Morton were originally named as defendants in one of the derivative actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, but were dropped as named defendants as of
December 22, 2006 upon the filing of a consolidated complaint in that action.

The derivative actions are at an early stage. The
defendants are not yet required to respond to the complaints in the actions pending in California, and the defendants have moved to dismiss or stay the action pending in Delaware. The Company’s Board of Directors has appointed a Special
Litigation Committee (“SLC”) composed solely of independent directors to conduct an independent investigation of the claims asserted in the derivative actions and to determine the Company’s position with respect to those claims. The
SLC’s investigation is in progress. The Company cannot predict whether these actions are likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to KLA-Tencor.

Shareholder Class Action Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices.

KLA-Tencor
and various of its current and former directors and officers were named as defendants in a putative securities class action filed on June 29, 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Two similar actions were
filed later in the same court, and all three cases have been consolidated into one action. The consolidated complaint alleges claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a result of the Company’s past stock option grants and related
accounting and reporting, and seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of purchasers of KLA-Tencor stock between June 30, 2001 and May 22, 2006 who allegedly suffered losses as
a result of material misrepresentations in KLA-Tencor’s SEC filings during that period. The lead plaintiffs, who seek to represent the class, are the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit, the Louisiana Municipal Police
Employees’ Retirement System, and the City of Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement. The defendants are KLA-Tencor, Edward W. Barnholt, H. Raymond Bingham, Robert J. Boehlke, Robert T. Bond, Gary E. Dickerson, Richard J. Elkus, Jr.,
Jeffrey L. Hall, Stephen P. Kaufman, John H. Kispert, Kenneth Levy, Michael E. Marks, Stuart J. Nichols, Kenneth L. Schroeder, Jon D. Tompkins, Lida Urbanek and Richard P. Wallace.

This litigation is at an early stage. Discovery has not commenced, and the court has not yet determined whether the plaintiffs may sue on behalf of any
class of purchasers. The Company and all other defendants filed motions to dismiss these cases in June 2007, which are now pending before the Court. The Company intends to vigorously defend this litigation.

As part of a derivative lawsuit filed in the Delaware Chancery Court on July 21, 2006 (described above), a plaintiff claiming to be a KLA-Tencor
shareholder also asserted a separate putative class action claim against the Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers alleging that shareholders incurred damage due to purported dilution of KLA-Tencor common stock
resulting from historical stock option granting practices. The Company has moved to dismiss this claim.

The Company cannot predict the
outcome of the shareholder class action cases (described above), and it cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results. However, an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse impact upon
the financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods.

Indemnification Obligations.

Subject to certain limitations, the Company is obligated to indemnify its current and former directors, officers and employees in connection with the investigation of the Company’s historical stock
option practices and the related litigation and ongoing government inquiry. These obligations arise under the terms of the Company’s certificate of incorporation, its bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation
to indemnify generally means that the Company is required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. The Company is currently paying or
reimbursing legal expenses being incurred in connection with these matters by a number of its current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments KLA-Tencor could be required to make under
these agreements is theoretically unlimited, the Company believes the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve it has established for currently pending legal proceedings.

Other Legal Matters.

The Company is named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of its business. Litigation, in general,
and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict.

NOTE 13—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Under its foreign-currency risk management strategy, KLA-Tencor utilizes derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations
in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed by KLA-Tencor as an integral part of its overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial
markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results. KLA-Tencor continues its policy of hedging its current and anticipated foreign currency exposures with hedging
instruments having tenors of up to eighteen months.

KLA-Tencor accounts for derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify or are not effective
as hedges must be recognized currently in earnings. All derivatives were reflected at fair value on the balance sheet date.

Cash Flow Hedges

KLA-Tencor’s international sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. For foreign currency denominated sales/expenses,
however, the volatility of the foreign currency markets represents risk to KLA-Tencor’s margins. KLA-Tencor defines its exposure as the risk of changes in the functional-currency-equivalent cash flows attributable to changes in the related
foreign currency exchange rates. Upon forecasting the exposure, KLA-Tencor hedges with forward contracts and currency options. These hedges are evaluated for effectiveness at inception and at least quarterly using the regression analysis.
Ineffectiveness is measured by comparing the change in value of the forward contracts to the change in value of the underlying transaction, with the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). The
mark-to-mark of excluded component (forward points) or any measured ineffectiveness is included immediately in “Interest income and other, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deferred hedge gains and losses and OCI
associated with hedges of foreign currency sales/expenses are reclassified to revenue/expenses upon recognition in income of the underlying hedged exposure. All amounts reported in OCI as of June 30, 2007 are anticipated to be reclassified to
revenue/expenses within twelve months.

The outstanding cash flow hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows:

The following table summarizes hedging activity in the OCI account during the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Other Foreign Currency Hedges

KLA-Tencor hedges its monetary non-functional assets and liabilities, and those of its subsidiaries. SFAS No. 52,

Foreign Currency Translation

, requires that such monetary assets and liabilities be
remeasured periodically for changes in the rate of exchange against the entities’ functional currency. Changes in value of these assets and liabilities are recorded in “Interest income and other, net” in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The volatility of the non-functional currencies together with the requirement to remeasure non-functional assets and liabilities may result in some volatility to KLA-Tencor’s Consolidated Statements of Operations if left unhedged.
In order to mitigate these effects, KLA-Tencor enters into remeasurement hedges which are forward contracts used to offset the foreign currency positions represented by non-functional monetary assets and liabilities. Remeasurement hedges are not
SFAS No. 133 designated hedges, thus changes in value of the remeasurement hedges are recorded currently in earnings. Changes in the values of underlying monetary non-functional assets and liabilities are also recorded currently in earnings and
should offset the change in value of the hedges. The outstanding other foreign currency hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows:

NOTE 14—SEGMENT REPORTING AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

KLA-Tencor reports one reportable segment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information

. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. KLA-Tencor’s chief operating decision makers are the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer.

KLA-Tencor
is engaged primarily in designing, manufacturing, and marketing yield management and process monitoring systems for the semiconductor industry. All operating units have been aggregated due to their inter-dependencies, commonality of long-term
economic characteristics, products and services, the production processes, class of customer and distribution processes. The Company’s service products are an extension of the system product portfolio and provide customers with spare parts and
fab management services (including system preventive maintenance and optimization services) to improve yield, increase production uptime and throughput, and lower the cost of ownership. Since KLA-Tencor operates in one segment, all financial segment
information required by SFAS No. 131 can be found in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

KLA-Tencor’s significant
operations outside the United States include manufacturing facilities in Israel and Singapore, and sales, marketing and service offices in Western Europe, Japan, and the Asia Pacific region. For geographical revenue reporting, revenues are
attributed to the geographic location in which the customer is located. Long-lived assets consist primarily of net property and equipment and are attributed to the geographic region in which they are located.

California. Based on the valuation of these assets using relevant market indicators such as range of estimated selling prices, the Company recorded an asset
impairment charge of approximately $56.8 million, which has been included in SG&A during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. In addition, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately 430 people (primarily in San Jose, California and
Milpitas, California) and recorded approximately $20.5 million in severance charges during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Approximately $4.9 million of the charges has been recorded as cost of revenues, $4.3 million in engineering,
research and development expenses, and $11.3 million has been recorded as SG&A expenses. These severance charges will be paid over the next twelve months.

The following is a summary of the Company’s quarterly consolidated results of operations (unaudited) for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007
and 2006.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of KLA-Tencor Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of KLA-Tencor Corporation’s 2007 and 2006 consolidated financial statements and of its internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of KLA-Tencor Corporation and its
subsidiaries at June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, effective July 1, 2005 the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based
compensation.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, effective June 30, 2007 the Company changed its method
of accounting for certain defined benefit pension plans.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under
Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
June 30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.



A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded
ADE Corporation, OnWafer Technologies, Inc., SensArray Corporation, Japan ADE, Ltd., and Therma-Wave, Inc., from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007 because these entities were acquired by the Company
in purchase business combinations during the year ended June 30, 2007. We have also excluded such entities from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The entities are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose combined total assets and
combined total revenues represent 14.3% and 4.6%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2007.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Remediation of Past Material Weaknesses
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies,
that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected.

As a result of the investigation of the Company’s historical stock option practices by the Special Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (for more information regarding the Special Committee
investigation and its findings, please refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”), the Company identified certain material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting in periods ending prior to the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2007. Before June 30, 2002, the Company did not have sufficient safeguards in place to monitor its control practices regarding stock option pricing and related financial reporting and to foster an effective flow of information
between those responsible for stock option pricing and those responsible for financial reporting. Inadequate training, communication and coordination in and among the Company’s human resources, stock administration, legal and finance functions
prevented the Company from assuring that stock options were priced and accounted for correctly, primarily from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2002.

In addition, the stock option pricing process during that time period was overly dependent on certain former executive officers of the Company, and was administered by a stock option committee that was not always
properly constituted and sometimes acted outside the scope of the authority delegated to it by the Company’s Board of Directors. The individual who served as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer during part of that time period and
continuing until midway through the last fiscal year, was involved in the past retroactive pricing of stock options. To that extent, the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting continued until midway
through the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. However, no issues regarding stock option pricing and accounting arose during the last fiscal year.

Since mid-2002, the Company has made a number of important changes in its controls related to granting, pricing and accounting for stock options. In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors elected a new
management team and approved new procedures for approving stock options and other equity awards. These changes include the following:

•

In response to certain of the reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires executive officers to report stock option grants within two
business days, the Company implemented new procedures for stock option grants that were designed to provide reasonable assurance that stock options were priced on the actual grant date. Since that time, with a few immaterial exceptions, there have
been no instances of retroactive pricing of stock options.

•

Also in response to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company established a confidential hotline for use by employees to report actual or
suspected wrongdoing and to answer questions about business conduct. Reports may be made anonymously, and all reports are investigated. Information about this hotline is available on the Company’s internal and external websites, and employees
are reminded of its existence at least annually.

•

Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) and added controls in its stock administration, human resources and finance functions to
ensure that stock-based compensation expenses are recorded correctly. In addition, the Company hired individuals knowledgeable about the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R).



•

In January 2006, a new management team elected by the Board of Directors took office. The new management team is led by Richard P. Wallace, the Chief Executive
Officer. After joining the Company in 1988, Mr. Wallace had spent most of his career in business unit roles, with no responsibility for corporate functions and no participation in the stock option granting process until mid-2005. During January
2006, well before the stock option issues were discovered, Mr. Wallace launched a number of key initiatives designed to foster open and direct communications and to establish a “tone at the top” based on integrity and excellence.
Mr. Wallace regularly communicates with all employees to reinforce these values, and the Company believes that these values have been embraced by the management team and general employee population.

•

As a result of the Special Committee investigation, in the fall of 2006, the Board of Directors suspended use of the stock option committee and delegated sole
authority for granting stock options and restricted stock awards to the full Compensation Committee, subject to ratification by the Board of Directors, with the grant date being the date of the Compensation Committee approval and with the pricing
based on the market price on the grant date. The Board of Directors may in the future evaluate the possibility of again using a stock option committee, and, if so, the Company will implement additional controls designed to assure that the stock
option committee is properly constituted and acts within the scope of its delegated authority.

•

In February 2007, the Compensation Committee approved, and the Board of Directors ratified, a new policy regarding equity award grant procedures. The new policy
incorporates the following elements (many of which were existing practices):

•

Annual reviews by the Compensation Committee of equity award dilution targets and overall equity plan design.

•

Quarterly approvals of equity awards by the Compensation Committee, at regularly scheduled meetings, including annual focal awards, employee new-hire and promotion
awards, and ongoing special program awards; quarterly meetings are usually scheduled in August, November, February and May.

•

In non-routine circumstances such as the hiring of a senior executive, approvals of equity awards by the Compensation Committee at special meetings or, when a
special meeting is not feasible, by unanimous written consent; otherwise, no equity awards will be approved by unanimous written consent. Clarification and enhancement of the administrative process for issuing equity awards to assure that
(a) the grant date of each award is the date of Compensation Committee approval, (b) the exercise or valuation price of each award is the closing market price on the date of grant, (c) notifications of the awards are promptly sent to
the recipients, and (d) the awards are promptly entered into the Company’s equity award database and financial records.

•

Annual reconciliations and reports regarding equity awards to allow the Compensation Committee to verify compliance with this policy;

The Company believes that these changes remediated the past material weaknesses identified above and reduced to remote the likelihood that any
retroactive pricing of stock options or any material error in accounting for stock options would not have been detected as of June 30, 2007. As a result, the Company believes that the likelihood that a material error in its financial statements
that could have originated during the last fiscal year and would not have been detected as of June 30, 2007 was remote.

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report are certifications of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
(CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). This Controls and Procedures section includes the information concerning the controls
evaluation referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.



The Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) as of the end of the period covered by this Report required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15b. The controls
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered
by this report the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Definition of Disclosure Controls

Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the
Company’s reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also designed to reasonably assure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company’s Disclosure Controls include components of
its internal control over financial reporting, which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the U.S. To the extent that components of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting are included within its Disclosure Controls, they are included in the scope of the Company’s annual
controls evaluation.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s
management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2007. The Company has excluded ADE Corporation, OnWafer Technologies, Inc., SensArray Corporation, Japan ADE, Ltd., and
Therma-Wave, Inc., from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007 because these entities were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. These
entities are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose combined total assets and combined total revenues represent 14.3% and 4.6%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2007. The assessment by the Company’s management of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management, including the CEO and
CFO, does not expect that the Company’s Disclosure Controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based



in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
