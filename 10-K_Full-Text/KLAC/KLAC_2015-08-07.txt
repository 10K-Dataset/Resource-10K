PART I

ITEM  1.

BUSINESS

The Company

KLA-Tencor Corporation (“KLA-Tencor” or the “Company” and also referred to as “we” or “our”) is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our products are also used in a number of other high technology industries, including the light emitting diode (“LED”) and data storage industries, as well as general materials research.

Within our primary area of focus, our comprehensive portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, helps integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process—from research and development (“R&D”) to final volume production. These products and offerings are designed to provide comprehensive solutions to help our customers to accelerate their development and production ramp cycles, to achieve higher and more stable semiconductor die yields, and to improve their overall profitability.

Industry

General Background

KLA-Tencor’s core focus is the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 150 millimeters, 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter, about as thick as a credit card and gray in color. The process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated, involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon. The ingots are then sliced into wafers. Prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish. Other, more specialized wafers, such as epitaxial silicon (“epi”), silicon-on-insulator (“SOI”), gallium nitride (“GaN”) and silicon carbide (“SiC”), are also common in the semiconductor industry.



The manufacturing cycle of an IC is grouped into three phases: design, fabrication and testing. IC design involves the architectural layout of the circuit, as well as design verification and reticle generation. The fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors, semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers. The deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns, remove portions of the film layers, and perform other functions such as heat treatment, measurement and inspection. Most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps, many of which are performed multiple times. Most chips consist of two main structures: the lower structure, typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip; and the upper “interconnect” structure, typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure. When all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated, each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality. The wafer is then cut into individual chips, and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged. Final testing is performed on all packaged chips.

Current Trends

The growth of consumer demand for mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets and wearable devices, is currently driving growth in the electronics industry and, as a result, growth in the semiconductor industry as well. Contained within each of these latest consumer devices are advanced semiconductors that are helping to enable the features consumers want in device performance, such as smaller product form factors, lower power requirements, bigger and brighter screens and speed, at a lower cost. Alongside this market growth, the industry continues to experience a high rate of change in technology, with the emergence of new techniques and architectures in production today, such as three-dimensional (

“

3D

”

) transistors, advanced patterning lithography, advanced wafer-level packaging and semiconductors with critical dimensions at 28 nanometer and below. KLA-Tencor’s inspection and measurement technologies play a key role in enabling our customers’ advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes to support these trends.

Companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market. Accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of high-performance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing. Ramping to high-volume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an IC manufacturer realizes for a given product. During past industry cycles, semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends, such as a specific design rule shrink. In today’s market, driven by consumer demand for low-cost electronic goods, the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies, some requiring new substrate and film materials, new geometries, advanced lithography and advanced packaging techniques.

While many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing, significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected the adoption of these technologies into full-volume production. For example, as design rules decrease, yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects and device performance characteristics (namely speed, capacity or power management) become more sensitive to parameters, such as line width and film thickness variation. New process materials, such as high-k dielectrics, SOI wafers and immersion lithography-capable photoresists, require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process. Moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face.

The continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multi-level circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices. Construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over $5 billion, substantially more than previous-generation facilities. In addition, chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment.

By developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production, we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment (“ROI”). Once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume, our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution. In addition, the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules, coupled with new materials and device innovation, has increased in-process variability, which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling.



KLA-Tencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer, reticle and IC manufacturing processes, but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems. The ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes. This helps them increase their yield of high-performance parts and deliver their products to market faster—thus maximizing their profits. With our broad portfolio of application-focused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise, we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ next-generation products, helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes, the transition to new production materials, new device and circuit architecture, more demanding lithography processes, and new back-end packaging techniques.

Products

KLA-Tencor is engaged primarily in the design, manufacture and marketing of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries and provides a comprehensive portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings.

KLA-Tencor’s defect inspection and metrology products and related offerings can be broadly categorized into the following groups: Chip Manufacturing, Wafer Manufacturing, Reticle Manufacturing, LED and Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing, Data Storage Media/Head Manufacturing, Microelectromechanical Systems (“MEMS”) Manufacturing, and General Purpose/Lab Applications. The more significant of these products are included in the product table at the end of this “Products” section. Every year, we introduce a number of new products; some of the new products we introduced in the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

are described below. We also provide refurbished KLA-Tencor tools as part of our K-T Certified

TM

program for customers manufacturing larger design-rule devices, as well as comprehensive service and support for our products.

Chip Manufacturing

KLA-Tencor’s comprehensive portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, helps chip manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process—from research and development to final volume production. These products and offerings are designed to provide comprehensive solutions to help our customers to accelerate their development and production ramp cycles, to achieve higher and more stable semiconductor die yields, and to improve their overall profitability.

Front-End Defect Inspection

KLA-Tencor’s front-end defect inspection tools cover a broad range of yield applications within the IC manufacturing environment, including: research and development; incoming wafer qualification; reticle qualification; and tool, process and line monitoring. Patterned and unpatterned wafer inspectors find particles, pattern defects and electrical issues on the front surface, back surface and edge of the wafer, allowing engineers to detect and monitor critical yield excursions. Fabs rely on our high sensitivity reticle inspection systems to identify defects in reticles at an early stage and to prevent reticle defects from printing on production wafers. The defect data generated by our inspectors is compiled and reduced to relevant root-cause and yield-analysis information with our suite of data management tools. By implementing our front-end defect inspection and analysis systems, chipmakers are able to take quick corrective action, resulting in faster yield improvement and better time to market.

In June 2015, we introduced the 8920 system, which provides high productivity inspection for a diverse range of applications, including advanced IC front-end lithography and chemical mechanical planarization (“CMP”) processes, automotive device fabrication and advanced legacy fab process control. In July 2014, we launched several front-end defect inspection products that help accelerate yield for next-generation design node devices: 2920 Series, Puma™ 9850 and Surfscan

®

SP5. The 2920 Series broadband plasma patterned wafer inspection systems are used to discover and monitor defects related to design or process issues, supporting advanced IC development and ramp. The Puma™ 9850 laser scanning patterned wafer inspection system utilizes a range of operating modes to support yield-relevant defect capture for lithography and etch applications and cost-effective excursion monitoring for film and CMP process modules. The Surfscan

®

SP5 unpatterned wafer inspection system utilizes deep ultra-violet (“DUV”) optical technologies and high throughput to assess incoming wafer quality, evaluate and qualify processes during R&D and monitor processes during production.



The products that we launched during the fiscal year ended

In addition, we offer a number of other products for the front-end defect inspection market, as reflected in the product table at the conclusion of this “Products” section.

Defect Review

KLA-Tencor’s defect review systems capture high resolution images of the defects detected by inspection tools. These images enable defect classification, helping chipmakers to identify and resolve yield issues. KLA-Tencor’s suite of defect inspectors, defect review and classification tools and data management systems form a broad solution for finding, identifying and tracking yield-critical defects and process issues. In July 2014, we introduced the eDR

TM

-7110, an electron-beam wafer defect review and classification system that utilizes improved automatic defect classification capability to quickly identify detected defects and produce an accurate representation of the detected defect population.

Advanced Packaging Process Control

KLA-Tencor offers standalone and cluster inspection and metrology systems for various applications in the field of advanced semiconductor packaging (i.e., at the middle and back-end of the semiconductor manufacturing process). Our CIRCL-AP™ all-surface inspection, metrology and review system supports advanced wafer-level packaging processes, such as 2.5D/3D IC integration using through silicon vias (“TSVs”), wafer-level chip scale packaging (“WLCSP”) and fan-out wafer-level packaging (“FOWLP”). Used for packaging applications associated with LEDs, MEMS, image sensors and flip-chip packaging, our WI-22x0 Series products focus on front side wafer inspection and provide feedback on wafer surface quality, quality of the wafer dicing, or quality of wafer bumps, pads and pillars. Our component inspector products inspect various semiconductor components that are handled in a tray, such as microprocessors or memory chips. Component inspection capability includes 3D coplanarity inspection, measurement of the evenness of the contacts, component height and two-dimensional (“2D”) surface inspection.

In April 2015, we introduced two systems that support advanced packaging applications: CIRCL-AP™ and the ICOS

Metrology

KLA-Tencor’s array of metrology solutions addresses IC and substrate manufacturing, as well as scientific research and other applications. Precise metrology and control of pattern dimensions, film thicknesses, layer-to-layer alignment, pattern placement, surface topography and electro-optical properties are important in many industries as critical dimensions narrow, film thicknesses shrink to countable numbers of atomic layers and devices become more complex.



In August 2014, we introduced our 5D™ patterning control solution which addresses five elements of patterning process control--the three geometrical dimensions of device structures, time-to-results and overall equipment efficiency. Our 5D™ patterning control solution supports advanced patterning technologies through the characterization, optimization and monitoring of fab-wide processes. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we launched several metrology products that are key components in our 5D™ patterning control solution and help accelerate the ramp of innovative patterning techniques for advanced design node devices:

Overlay Metrology

In February 2015, we introduced the Archer

TM

500LCM, a high performance overlay metrology system which provides accurate overlay error data that can be used for scanner corrections or for identification of inline excursions, helping engineers determine when to re-work wafers or adjust processes to meet patterning requirements. Offering both imaging and laser-based scatterometry measurement technologies, the Archer

TM

500LCM provides flexible overlay control for all process layers in leading-edge development and high volume production.

Reticle Registration Metrology

In August 2014, we introduced the LMS IPRO6 system, which is used by mask shops for comprehensive characterization of reticle pattern placement error, which is a direct contributor to wafer-level pattern overlay error. The LMS IPRO6 utilizes model-based metrology to accurately measure reticle registration for on-device pattern features and standard registration marks, producing higher sampling for better determination of mask quality.

Metrology Data Analysis

In August 2014, we introduced K-T Analyzer

®

9.0, which offers advanced, run-time data analysis for a wide range of metrology system types, including overlay, reticle registration, wafer geometry, films, critical dimension and device profile metrology systems.

The products that we launched during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 further strengthened our broad range of offerings that support the metrology market. The Archer

TM

Series of overlay metrology tools enable characterization of overlay error on lithography process layers for advanced patterning technologies. The SpectraShape

TM

family of optical CD and shape metrology systems fully characterize and monitor the critical dimensions and 3D shapes of geometrically complex features incorporated by some IC manufacturers in their latest generation devices. Finally, the SpectraFilm

TM

and Aleris

TM

families of film metrology tools provide reliable and precise measurement of film thickness, refractive index, stress and composition for a broad range of film layers. In addition, we offer a number of other products for the metrology market, as reflected in the product table at the conclusion of this “Products” section.

In-Situ Process Monitoring

KLA-Tencor’s SensArray

®

SensorWafers are a portfolio of advanced wireless and wired temperature monitoring wafers that capture the effect of the process environment on production wafers. These SensorWafers provide unique insight into thermal uniformity and profile temperature under real production conditions. SensArray products are used in many semiconductor and flat panel display fabrication processes, including lithography, etch and deposition.



Lithography Software

KLA-Tencor’s PROLITH

TM

product line provides researchers at advanced IC manufacturers, lithography hardware suppliers, track companies and material providers with virtual lithography software to explore critical-feature designs, manufacturability and process-limited yield of proposed lithographic technologies without the time and expense of printing hundreds of test wafers using experimental materials and prototype process equipment.

In January 2015, we introduced PROLITH

TM

X5.1, which provides simulation capability for anamorphic imaging for high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (“EUV”) lithography, and supports all lithography technologies, including 193nm immersion lithography, spacer-based Self-Aligned Double Patterning ("SADP") and thick resist lithography for 3D interconnects and MEMS manufacturing. In May 2015, we released the latest version of our process window analysis software tool, ProDATA™ V2.0, which provides engineers with a systematic, robust approach to understanding and optimizing lithography processes across the IC fab.

Wafer Manufacturing

KLA-Tencor’s portfolio of products focused on the demands of wafer manufacturers includes inspection, metrology and data management systems. Specialized inspection tools assess surface quality and detect, count and bin defects during the wafer manufacturing process and as a critical part of outgoing inspection. Wafer geometry tools ensure that the wafer is extremely flat and uniform in thickness, with precisely controlled surface topography. Specifications for wafer defectivity, geometry and surface quality are tightening as the dimensions of transistors become so small that the geometry of the substrate can substantially affect transistor performance.

Our wafer inspection portfolio is anchored by the Surfscan

®

SP3 Series defect inspection systems designed to enable development and production monitoring of polished wafers, epi wafers and engineered substrates. The SURFmonitor

TM

module characterizes wafer surface quality and captures the low-contrast defects. The WaferSight

TM

platform offers bare wafer geometry and nanotopography metrology capabilities. Other products that we offer for the wafer manufacturing market are highlighted in the product table at the conclusion of this “Products” section.

Reticle Manufacturing

Error-free reticles, or masks, are necessary to achieving high semiconductor device yields, since reticle defects can be replicated in every die on production wafers. KLA-Tencor offers high sensitivity reticle inspection and metrology systems for mask shops, designed to help them manufacture reticles that are free of pattern defects that could print on the wafers and meet pattern placement and critical dimension uniformity specifications. In August 2014, we introduced the LMS IPRO6 reticle metrology system which enables improved characterization of mask quality through accurate measurement of reticle pattern placement error for on-device pattern features in addition to standard registration marks.

Our reticle inspection portfolio includes the Teron

TM

600 Series for development and manufacturing of advanced optical and EUV masks, the TeraScan

TM

500XR system for mask shop production of reticles for the 32nm node and above and our X5.2

TM

and Teron

TM

SL650 products for reticle quality control capability for IC fabs. These products include the capability for mapping critical dimension uniformity across the reticle. In addition, we offer the LMS IPRO line of reticle metrology systems for measuring pattern placement error. If the pattern on the reticle is displaced from its intended location, overlay error can result on the wafer, which can lead to electrical continuity issues affecting yield, performance or reliability of the IC device.

LED and Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing

LEDs are becoming more commonly used in solid-state lighting, television and notebook backlighting, and automotive applications. As LED device makers target aggressive cost and performance targets, they place significant emphasis on improved process control and yield during the manufacturing process.

®

8620, Klarity

®

LED and WI-2280. The Candela 8620 substrate and epi wafer inspection system provides automated inspection and quality control of LED substrates, detecting defects that can impact device performance, yield and field reliability. Klarity LED is an automated defect data management and analysis system for LED yield enhancement. The WI-2280 system is a patterned wafer inspection tool that is designed specifically for defect inspection and 2D metrology for LED applications.



Our primary products for compound semiconductor manufacturing include Candela CS20 and the P-Series Stylus Profiler, used for the inspection of substrates, epi-layers and process films. In addition, the Candela CS920 is used by power device manufacturers for defect inspection and classification on SiC substrate and epi wafers.

Data Storage Media/Head Manufacturing

Advancements in data storage are being driven by a wave of innovative consumer electronics with small form factors and immense storage capacities, as well as an increasing need for high-volume storage options to back up modern methods of remote computing and networking (such as cloud computing). Our process control and yield management solutions are designed to enable customers to rapidly understand and resolve complex manufacturing problems, which can help improve time to market and product yields. In the front-end and back-end of thin-film head wafer manufacturing, we offer the same process control equipment that we serve to the semiconductor industry. In addition, we offer an extensive range of test equipment and surface profilers with particular strength in photolithography. In substrate and media manufacturing, we offer metrology and defect inspection solutions with KLA-Tencor’s optical surface analyzers.

MEMS Manufacturing

The increasing demand for MEMS technology is coming from diverse industries such as automotive, space and consumer electronics. MEMS have the potential to revolutionize nearly every product category by bringing together silicon-based microelectronics with micromachining technology, making possible the realization of complete systems-on-a-chip. KLA-Tencor offers tools and techniques for this emerging market, such as defect inspection and review, optical inspection and surface profiling, which were first developed for the integrated circuit industry.

General Purpose/Lab Applications

A range of industries, including general scientific and materials research and optoelectronics, require measurements of surface topography to either control their processes or research new material characteristics. Typical measurement parameters that our tools address include flatness, roughness, curvature, peak-to-valley, asperity, waviness, texture, volume, sphericity, slope, density, stress, bearing ratio and distance (mainly in the micron to nanometer range). In September 2014, we introduced the Alpha-Step

®

D-500 stylus profiler designed for 2D measurements of surface topography and the Alpha-Step D-600 stylus profiler designed for high resolution 2D and 3D surface topography measurements. The two systems support a broad range of R&D and production applications.

Customers

To support our growing global customer base, we maintain a significant presence throughout Asia, the United States and Europe, staffed with local sales and applications engineers, customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants. We count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions.

For the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


, the following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues:

Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ICs and products utilizing ICs. We do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature, but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers, and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets. Downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.

Sales, Service and Marketing

Our sales, service and marketing efforts are aimed at building long-term relationships with our customers. We focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services. Our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination, as well as the increased equipment compatibility, which are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services. Our revenues are derived primarily from product sales, mostly through our direct sales force.

We believe that the size and location of our field sales, service and applications engineering, and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets. We have direct sales forces in Asia, the United States and Europe. We maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the United States Departments of Commerce and State.

As of

June 30, 2015

, we employed approximately 2,390 full-time sales and related personnel, service engineers and applications engineers. In addition to sales and service offices in the United States, we conduct sales, marketing and services out of wholly-owned subsidiaries or branches in other countries, including Belgium, China, Germany, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. International revenues accounted for approximately

71%

,

76%

and

70%

of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


, respectively. Additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in Note 17, “Segment Reporting and Geographic Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We believe that sales outside the United States will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to compete successfully in Asia, one of the largest markets for our equipment. Our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the United States, and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region.



International sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, restrictions on export technology, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations. In addition, international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business. Although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in non-U.S. dollar product sales through hedging activities, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate. These factors, as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.

Backlog

Our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled $984 million and $977 million as of

June 30, 2015

and


, respectively, and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months. Orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog. All orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, often with limited or no penalties. We make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies, sales order cancellations, customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments. Shipment backlog is not subject to normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature, making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading.

Our revenue backlog, which includes the gross value of sales orders where physical deliveries have been completed, but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition, totaled $221 million and $269 million as of

June 30, 2015

and


, respectively. Orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog.

Because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders, and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter, our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods. The cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between, on the one hand, our ability to manufacture, deliver and install products and, on the other, the requirements of our customers. In our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources, management of our operating model and other factors, we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing, deliveries and installations of products, which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products.

Research and Development

The market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation. These technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. We believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs. In addition, we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs. As of

June 30, 2015

, we employed approximately 1,480 full-time research and development personnel.

Our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes, the transition to new production materials, new device and circuit architecture, more demanding lithography processes and new back-end packaging techniques. For information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years, including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



The strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology, which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development. Even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry, we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position. New product introductions, however, may contribute to fluctuations in operating results, since customers may defer ordering existing products, and, if new products have reliability or quality problems, those problems may result in reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products, or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace. If we do not successfully introduce new products, our results of operations will be adversely affected.

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies

We perform system design, assembly and testing in-house and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies. Our in-house manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through third-party vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products. Our principal manufacturing activities take place in the United States (Milpitas, California), Singapore, Israel, Germany and China. As of

June 30, 2015

, we employed approximately 970 full-time manufacturing personnel.

Some critical parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, “parts”) that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications, while other parts are standard commercial products. We use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, this is not always possible, and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Through our business interruption planning, we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by, among other things, monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials, and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules.

Although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources, or disruptions within our suppliers’ often-complex supply chains, could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers, damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Competition

The worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive. In each of our product markets, we face competition from established and potential competitors, such as Applied Materials, Inc., ASML Holding N.V., Hermes Microvision, Inc., Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation and Nanometrics, Inc., some of which may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. We may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics. We believe that, to remain competitive, we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process research and development.

We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive factors, the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity. Significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, interoperability with the existing installed base and technical service and support, as well as overall cost of ownership.

Management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services. However, any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues, gross margins and market share, any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.



Acquisitions and Alliances

We continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. The inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.

Patents and Other Proprietary Rights

We protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws, including patent, copyright and trade secret. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the United States and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws. In addition, from time to time we acquire license rights under United States and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties, and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures.

Although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business, due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry, we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise, continuing development of new systems, market penetration, installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide.

No assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications, that license assignments will be made as anticipated, or that our patents, licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. No assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position.

However, any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment, alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities.

Employees

As of

June 30, 2015

, we employed approximately 5,880 full-time employees. Except for our employees in Belgium (where a trade union delegation has been recognized) and our employees in the German operations of our MIE business unit (who are represented by employee works council), none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.

Competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management, marketing and technical employees.

As discussed in our Note 15, “Restructuring Charges,” we announced in April 2015 a plan to reduce our global workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in our industry. The goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. Refer to the above footnote for additional details.

ITEM  1A.

RISK FACTORS

A description of factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is provided below.

Risks Associated with Our Industry

Ongoing changes in the technology industry, as well as the semiconductor industry in particular, could expose our business to significant risks.

The semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time. Many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies, such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve, pricing trends in the end-markets for consumer electronics and other products (which place a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership), changes in our customers’ capital spending patterns and, in general, an environment of constant change and development, including decreasing product and component dimensions; use of new materials; and increasingly complex device structures, applications and process steps. If we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends, or, with respect to technological advances, if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.

In addition, we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry, as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers. Some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following:

•

the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers’ investment decisions;

•

differing market growth rates and capital requirements for different applications, such as memory, logic and foundry;

•

lower level of process control adoption by our memory customers compared to our foundry and logic customers;

•

our customers’ reuse of existing and installed products, which may decrease their need to purchase new products or solutions at more advanced technology nodes;

•

the emergence of disruptive technologies that change the prevailing semiconductor manufacturing processes (or the economics associated with semiconductor manufacturing) and, as a result, also impact the inspection and metrology requirements associated with such processes;

•

the higher design costs for the most advanced integrated circuits, which could economically constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large, technologically advanced products and applications;

•

the possible introduction of integrated products by our larger competitors that offer inspection and metrology functionality in addition to managing other semiconductor manufacturing processes;

•

changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes that are extremely costly for our customers to implement and, accordingly, our customers could reduce their available budgets for process control equipment by reducing inspection and metrology sampling rates for certain technologies;

•

the reversal of the historical trend of declining cost per transistor with each new generation of technological advancement within the semiconductor industry, and the adverse impact that such reversal would have upon our business;

•

the bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry into (a) leading edge manufacturers driving continued research and development into next-generation products and technologies and (b) other manufacturers that are content with existing (including previous generation) products and technologies;

•

the ever escalating cost of next-generation product development, which may result in joint development programs between us and our customers or government entities to help fund such programs that could restrict our control of, ownership of and profitability from the products and technologies developed through those programs;

•

the potential industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers; and

•

the entry by some semiconductor manufacturers into collaboration or sharing arrangements for capacity, cost or risk with other manufacturers, as well as increased outsourcing of their manufacturing activities, and greater focus only on specific markets or applications, whether in response to adverse market conditions or other market pressures.

Any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce, which could result in downward pressure on our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins. If we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted.



We are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.

Our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, historically has been, and is becoming increasingly, highly concentrated  due to corporate consolidation, acquisitions and business closures. In this environment, orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of our sales. This increasing concentration exposes our business, financial condition and operating results to a number of risks, including the following:

•

The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers.

•

New orders from our foundry customers in the past several years have constituted a significant portion of our total orders. This concentration increases the impact that future business or technology changes within the foundry industry may have on our business, financial condition and operating results.

•

In a highly concentrated business environment, if a particular customer does not place an order, or if they delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business. Furthermore, because our products are configured to each customer’s specifications, any changes, delays or cancellations of orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs.

•

As a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and, consequently, have greater commercial negotiating leverage. Many of our large customers have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative, second-source suppliers for the products we offer and, in addition, may seek and, on occasion, receive pricing, payment, intellectual property-related or other commercial terms that may have an adverse impact on our business. Any of these changes could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins.

•

Certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes, created alliances with other companies, experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities, any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions. Any future change in ownership or management of our existing customers may result in similar challenges, including the possibility of the successor entity or new management deciding to select a competitor’s products.

•

The highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers. For example, as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009, we were (and in some cases continue to be) exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers. To the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future, we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers. In addition, customers with liquidity issues may be forced to reduce purchases of our equipment, delay deliveries of our products, discontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers, and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base.

•

Semiconductor manufacturers generally must commit significant resources to qualify, install and integrate process control and yield management equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s process control and yield management equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment. Similarly, we expect it to be challenging for a competitor to sell its products to a given customer for a specific production line application if that customer initially selects our equipment.

•

Prices differ among the products we offer for different applications due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs. If there is a shift in demand by our customers from our higher-priced to lower-priced products, our gross margin and revenue would decrease. In addition, when products are initially introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.



The semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical. The purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide. If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.

The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity, which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization, consumer demand for products, inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital. This cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, in some cases, future expense levels. During down cycles in our industry, the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted, which could result not only in a decrease in, or cancellation or delay of, orders (which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty) but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers. Our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer’s funding status, which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or company-specific reasons, but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer’s unique corporate structure. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.

When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During periods of declining revenues, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees. If we fail to respond, or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results, then our business could be seriously harmed. Furthermore, any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges, disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand. We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles. Each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.

In addition, our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics, which, when made, are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time. However, largely due to the cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate, and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles, our actual results may vary (and have varied in the past) from forecasted results. These variations can occur for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders, product shipments or product acceptances; an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions; or a different than anticipated effective tax rate. The impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment. This is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues, but also, due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order in order to meet the expected lead times, to significant inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided. We provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future, but parties reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of, and are themselves, forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this Item 1A and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. If our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts, or if we revise our forecasts, the market price of our common stock could decline.



Risks Related to Our Business Model and Capital Structure

If we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed.

Success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions. For over 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips. That driver appears to be slowing, which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment, investigate more complex device architectures, use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes. These and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support. Technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees. Our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards, develop and introduce new products and solutions that successfully address changing customer needs, win market acceptance of these new products and solutions, and manufacture these new products in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our failure to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop as well as offer competitive technology solutions in a timely manner with cost-effective products could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.

In this environment, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance, features and functionality of our products, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands. Substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products. There can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements. In addition, we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us. Our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products.

In addition, the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks. We regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer (even before receiving the customer’s formal acceptance of that product) in certain situations, including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory, transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations, and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted. However, our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents (all of which must perform to their respective specifications), so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications. In such a situation, the customer may be entitled to certain remedies, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and, as a result, our stock price.

We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of defect inspection products. As a result, any delay or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The continued customer demand for these products and the development, introduction and market acceptance of new products and technologies are critical to our future success.



Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. If we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology, we may lose valuable assets.

Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. We own various United States and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own, adversely affecting our business. In addition, we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers, and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects. The termination of any such collaboration, or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration, could significantly impair our research and development efforts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.

We also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation. However, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.

While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. We also maintain exclusive and non-exclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products. However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In any event, the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited, and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors.

Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide.

Our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support capabilities than we possess. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer. These competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products, including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. The strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology, which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development. However, we may enter new markets, whether through acquisitions or new internal product development, in which competition is based primarily on product pricing, not technological superiority. Further, some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies. Loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve, or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter, could negatively affect our prices, customer orders, revenues, gross margins and market share, any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.



Our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and cost-effective manner.

We use a wide range of materials in the production of our products, including custom electronic and mechanical components, and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials. We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders, we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing. Through our business interruption planning, we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by, among other things, monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Also, key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property; in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for high-performance, high-technology components, which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products. In addition, if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations, which is a heightened risk during economic downturns, it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products. Similarly, especially with respect to suppliers of high-technology components, our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains, and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products. Our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications, or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms. Furthermore, a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons, including the supplier’s financial condition or business operational decisions, which would require us to purchase, in a single transaction, a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers. Such “end-of-life” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period, and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory write-off, either of which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods.

If we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan, our operating results, business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted.

We attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually, revised frequently (generally quarterly), and reviewed by management even more frequently (at least monthly). Our business plan is developed based on a number of factors, many of which require estimates and assumptions, such as our expectations of the economic environment, future business levels, our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders, lead-times, and future revenue and cash flow. Our budgeted operating expenses, for example, are based in part on our future revenue expectations. However, our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors, including the volatile and cyclical nature of our primary industry, customer order cancellations, macroeconomic changes, operational matters regarding particular agreements, our ability to manage customer deliveries, the availability of resources for the installation of our products, delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products (for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales), our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively, and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this Item 1A.

Because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term, any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results. Similarly, if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls, we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period, which would also negatively affect our results of operations. If we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan, our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted. Such an outcome could cause customers, suppliers or investors to view us as less stable, or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or stock price.

In addition, our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources, the need to manage our operating model and other factors. In furtherance of those efforts, we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing, deliveries, installations and payment scheduling. Any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue, including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized, with respect to such products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or stock price.



Our outstanding indebtedness was substantially increased in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and, as a result, our capital structure is more highly leveraged.

As of

June 30, 2015

, we had approximately

$3.21 billion

aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, consisting of

$2.50 billion

aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes and approximately

$711.3 million

of term loans under a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). Additionally, we have commitments for an unfunded revolving credit facility of $500.0 million under the Credit Agreement. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement and/or entering into new financing arrangements. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, our credit rating, the ongoing interest rate environment and the other risk factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.

In addition, the interest rates of the senior, unsecured long-term notes may be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s or S&P, as the case may be (a “Substitute Rating Agency”), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade. Accordingly, changes by Moody’s, S&P, or a Substitute Rating Agency to the rating of any series of notes, our outlook or credit rating could require us to pay additional interest, which may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline. Factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness, and our business strategy.

In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of notes by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch Inc., unless we have exercised its right to redeem the notes of such series, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”). In the Change of Control Offer, we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase. We cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of notes. Our ability to repurchase that series of notes in such event may be limited by law, by the indenture associated with that series of notes, or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time. If we fail to repurchase that series of notes as required by the terms of such notes, it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing that series of notes which, in turn, may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations.

The term loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a fixed spread, and, therefore, any increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest, which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline. The interest rate under the Credit Facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. Additionally, under the Credit Agreement, we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants, which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios, the details of which can be found in Note 7, “Debt.” If we fail to comply with these covenants, we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time. In addition, certain of our domestic subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement are required to guarantee our borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In the event that we default on our borrowings, these domestic subsidiaries shall be liable for our borrowings, which could disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or stock price.



Our leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and earnings per share.

We completed our leveraged recapitalization transaction during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014, which included raising approximately $3.25 billion in new borrowings, consisting of $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes and approximately $750.0 million of term loans under the Credit Agreement, payment of a special cash dividend of approximately $2.76 billion and prepayment of our $750 million of existing senior notes due in 2018. Our issuance and maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including, but not limited to:

•

a negative impact on our ability to satisfy our future obligations;

•

an increase in the portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to increased interest and principal payments that may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, dividends, stock repurchases, general corporate or other purposes;

•

an impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; and

•

obligations to comply with restrictive and financial covenants as noted in the above risk factor and Note 7, “Debt.”

Our ability to satisfy our future expenses as well as our new debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. Furthermore, our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our new debt obligations, which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating. If our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows, we may need to access the unfunded revolving credit facility of $500 million under the Credit Agreement or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms. Any additional borrowing under the Credit Agreement will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants. If we fail to make a payment associated with our new debt obligations, we could be in default on such debt, and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.

There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts.

Our Board of Directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. Since that time, we have announced a number of increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level as well as payment of a special cash dividend that was declared and substantially paid in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. Future dividends may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; stock repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; changes to our business model; and our increased interest and principal payments required by our approximately $3.21 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.

We are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions, including our indemnification of third parties, as well as the performance of our products.

Although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners, counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions. In situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions, or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations, we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them. Such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties, costly and time-consuming litigation, or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes, or could impact our revenue or cost recognition. Any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



In addition, in our commercial agreements, from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers, suppliers and lessors, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. We may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations, or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes. In addition, notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements, the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions, and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor, any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings. It is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations, whether or not asserted, due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim. Our business, financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims, regardless of their merit or outcomes.

We are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues. Our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects, especially when products are first introduced. Unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us, including increased service or warranty costs, providing product replacements for (or modifications to) defective products, litigation related to defective products, reimbursement for damages caused by our products, product recalls, or product write-offs or disposal costs. These costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects, which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business.

Furthermore, we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers, and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives, such as credits toward future purchases. We believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our long-term business, as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products. However, these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased, to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives. As a result, these volume purchase arrangements, while expected to be beneficial to our business over time, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in near-term periods, including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins.

In addition, we may, in limited circumstances, enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, response time and other commitments. Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. To date, we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future. Our business, financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection, or defending or settling any purported claims, regardless of their merit or outcomes.



There are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development.

We are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies, both domestically and internationally. Governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion, or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved, so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future. In addition, under the terms of these government grants, the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur, directly and indirectly, in connection with such programs. Any such audit could result in modifications to, or even termination of, the applicable government funding program. For example, if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program, those costs would not be reimbursed, and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded. We do not know the outcome of any future audits. Any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties (financial or otherwise), termination of funding programs, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency, any of which could adversely impact our operating results, financial condition and ability to operate our business.

We have recorded significant restructuring, inventory write-off and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future, which could have a material negative impact on our business.

Historically, we recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reduction, large excess inventory write-offs, and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we recorded net restructuring charges of

$31.6 million

of which

$22.4 million

was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, primarily related to our plan to reduce our global employee workforce in order to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in our industry. Such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity, which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans, or do so within the expected time frame. If we again restructure our organization and business processes, implement additional cost reduction actions or discontinue certain business operations, we may take additional, potentially material, restructuring charges related to, among other things, employee terminations or exit costs. We may also be required to write-off additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline. Also, as our lead times from suppliers increase (due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide) and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease (due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production), we may be compelled to increase our commitments, and therefore our risk exposure, to inventory purchases to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner, and that inventory may need to be written-off if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason. Such additional write-offs could constitute material charges.

As noted above, in the past, we recorded a material charge related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill. Purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for long-lived assets. The valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows, market multiples, and discount rates. A substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets (and, as applicable, the amount of any previous impairment charge), could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge.

Any such additional material charges, whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment, may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements.



We are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements.

We enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions, any of which may prove not to be financially viable. If we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables. However, by entering into these arrangements, and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services, we are exposed to additional risks. If any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements, we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds, any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

We are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered.

In connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices, we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws, such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. If we were to violate any such law, we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation, but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation, which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings. Any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses, and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business. These expenditures and diversions, as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

General Commercial, Operational, Financial and Regulatory Risks

We are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy.

The markets for semiconductors, and therefore our business, are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses. Economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending, which caused our customers to decrease, cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009. In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Reduced demand, combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing (or the unavailability of such financing), has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results, and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels.

In addition, a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments. Our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities, money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments. Although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and (where applicable) credit ratings, a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity. If the market value of such investments were to decline, or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions, we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

If we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.



A majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the United States, and we maintain significant operations outside the United States. We are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations.

A majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the United States, and we maintain significant operations outside the United States. We expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future. Managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges, including but not limited to:

•

managing cultural diversity and organizational alignment;

•

exposure to the unique characteristics of each region in the global semiconductor market, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period;

•

periodic local or international economic downturns;

•

potential adverse tax consequences, including withholding tax rules that may limit the repatriation of our earnings, and higher effective income tax rates in foreign countries where we do business;

•

government controls, either by the United States or other countries, that restrict our business overseas or the import or export of semiconductor products or increase the cost of our operations;

•

compliance with customs regulations in the countries in which we do business;

•

tariffs or other trade barriers (including those applied to our products or to parts and supplies that we purchase);

•

political instability, natural disasters, legal or regulatory changes, acts of war or terrorism in regions where we have operations or where we do business;

•

fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business. Although we attempt to manage some of our near-term currency risks through the use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate;

•

longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the United States;

•

difficulties in managing foreign distributors (including monitoring and ensuring our distributors’ compliance with all applicable United States and local laws); and

•

inadequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property and other legal rights in foreign jurisdictions.

Any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.

We might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve, prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.

As is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry, from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. In addition, we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties. With respect to intellectual property infringement disputes, our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate. However, we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. The inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may potentially be subject to claims by customers, suppliers or other business partners, or by governmental law enforcement agencies, related to our receipt, distribution and/or use of third-party intellectual property or confidential information. Legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their merit, and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; may divert management’s attention and other company resources; and/or may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products, settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines, any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. The instigation of legal proceedings or claims, our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims, or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our business reputation.



We are exposed to various risks related to the legal (including environmental), regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business.

We are subject to various risks related to compliance with new, existing, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply, including environmental, safety, antitrust, anti-corruption/anti-bribery, unclaimed property and export control regulations. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws, rules or regulations, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations (including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules or regulations), in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to conduct our business. From time to time, we may receive inquiries or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies, or we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs, related to legal, regulatory or tax compliance matters, and these inquiries, notices or programs may result in significant financial cost (including investigation expenses, defense costs, assessments and penalties), reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations, including those that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, gases and other substances. Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. In addition, changes in environmental regulations (including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions) could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment, alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute (potentially more expensive and/or rarer) materials. Further, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release, regardless of fault. We also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing, product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials. The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to conduct our business.

In addition, we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment, immigration, contracts, product performance, product liability, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, unfair competition and other matters (in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters, which are separately discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A). These legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend, divert management’s attention and resources, and/or inhibit our ability to sell our products. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims, which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to operate our business.

Recent regulations related to “conflict minerals” may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals (referred to as “conflict minerals,” regardless of their actual country of origin) in their products. Some of these metals are commonly used in electronic equipment and devices, including our products. These requirements require companies to annually investigate, disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We have an extremely complex supply chain, with numerous suppliers (many of whom are not obligated to investigate their own supply chains) for the components and parts used in each of our products. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with the diligence and disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant metals used in our products. In addition, because our supply chain is so complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origin of all the relevant metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our business reputation. Though we do not anticipate that our customers will need to know our conflict mineral status to satisfy their own SEC reporting obligations (if any), we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers if they nonetheless require that we prove or certify that our products are “conflict free.” Key components and parts that can be shown to be “conflict free” may not be available to us in sufficient quantity, or at all, or may only be available at significantly higher cost to us. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier. Any of these outcomes could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results.



We depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our key employees, our sales and product development could be harmed.

Our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and other employees are difficult to replace. We generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees. Further, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. The expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain key personnel, or if we are not able to attract, assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future, our business and operations could be harmed.

We outsource a number of services to third-party service providers, which decreases our control over the performance of these functions. Disruptions or delays at our third-party service providers could adversely impact our operations.

We outsource a number of services, including our transportation, information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions, to domestic and overseas third-party service providers. While outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations, they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered, on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions, or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations. In addition, many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ “cloud computing” technology for such storage (which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user’s physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an Internet-based service). These providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents,” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises, that are outside of our control. If we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if our third-party service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyber-related security breaches, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, we may experience operational difficulties (such as limitations on our ability to ship products), increased costs, manufacturing or service interruptions or delays, loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data, quality and compliance issues, and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents.

In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit and store data on information systems. This data includes confidential information and intellectual property belonging to us, our customers and our business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. We allocate significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect our information systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. Despite our ongoing efforts to enhance our network security measures, our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses, cyber-related security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions, tampering or misuse, and subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures. Any of these occurrences could result in disruptions to our operations; misappropriation, corruption or theft of confidential information, including intellectual property and other critical data, of KLA-Tencor, our customers and other business partners; reduced value of our investments in research, development and engineering; litigation with, or payment of damages to, third parties; reputational damage; costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions; data privacy issues; costs to rebuild our internal information systems; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.

We rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations. Our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations.

Our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, network communications, email and various computer hardware and software applications. System failures or malfunctioning, such as difficulties with our customer relationship management (“CRM”) system, could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results. Our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records, record transactions, provide critical information to our management, and prepare our financial statements. Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our ERP system or other systems (whether in connection with the regular operation, periodic enhancements, modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems) could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes, such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.



Acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but, because of the uncertainties involved, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses. We are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter.

In addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources, part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources. As part of this effort, we may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. There can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful. In addition, we may use equity to finance future acquisitions, which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders.

If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly, then our business and financial results may suffer. It is possible that the businesses we have acquired, as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future, may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated. In addition, we may lose key employees of the acquired companies. As a result, risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons, including:

•

we may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses;

•

the combination of businesses may cause the loss of key personnel or an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our company and/or the acquired business;

•

we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions;

•

we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products;

•

we may face difficulties in coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;

•

the customers, distributors, suppliers, employees and others with whom the companies we acquire have business dealings may have a potentially adverse reaction to the acquisition;

•

we may have to write-off goodwill or other intangible assets; and

•

we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions.

At times, we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers, suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property. These alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary, highly sensitive information. The success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

Disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations, or in the operations of our customers, due to earthquake, flood, other natural catastrophic events, health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries or other business activities, or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business.

We have significant manufacturing operations in the United States, Singapore, Israel, Germany and China. In addition, our business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world. Operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors, as well as our other operations and those of our customers, are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, health epidemics, fire, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. Such disruption could cause delays in, among other things, shipments of products to our customers, our ability to perform services requested by our customers, or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites. We cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations (whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise) would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that, if such alternate means were available, they could be obtained on favorable terms.

In addition, as part of our cost-cutting actions, we have consolidated several operating facilities. Our California operations are now primarily centralized in our Milpitas facility. The consolidation of our California operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above, such as acts of war or terrorism, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters, if any such event were to impact our Milpitas facility.



We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war. If international political instability continues or increases, our business and results of operations could be harmed.

The threat of terrorism targeted at, or acts of war in, the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets. Any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business. Increased international political instability in various parts of the world, disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations. We maintain significant manufacturing and research and development operations in Israel, an area that has historically experienced a high degree of political instability, and we are therefore exposed to risks associated with future instability in that region. Such instability could directly impact our ability to operate our business (or our customers’ ability to operate their businesses) in the affected region, cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable, increase our insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to fluctuate. Such instability could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products. If international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business, our business and results of operations could be harmed. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war.

We self-insure certain risks including earthquake risk. If one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.

We purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks; however, certain risks are uninsurable, are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance. Accordingly, we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance, either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy. For example, we do not currently hold earthquake insurance. An earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, a significant portion of which are conducted in California, an area highly susceptible to earthquakes. It could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products, much of which is also conducted in California. We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake, but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake. We self-insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market. Certain other risks are also self-insured either based on a similar cost-benefit analysis, or based on the unavailability of insurance. If one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Although we hedge certain currency risks, we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries.

We have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the euro and the Japanese Yen. We have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally. In addition, an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the United States, and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies. We routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations. To the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place, our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings. In addition, we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock.

Our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As market interest rates and bond yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. We believe we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity. However, an impairment of the fair market value of our investments, even if unrealized, must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period.



In addition, the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years. The trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors, including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate, fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets, our operating results or other performance metrics, or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A. Volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies.

We are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions.

We are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits (such as related to customs or product safety requirements) in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes, penalties, fines or other prohibitions against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations, the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

A change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business.

We earn profits in, and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in, the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore, Israel and the Cayman Islands, the countries in which we earn the majority of our non-U.S. profits. Due to economic, political or other conditions, tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. A number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (for example, proposals for fundamental United States international tax reform); changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and the repatriation of earnings from outside the United States for which we have not previously provided for United States taxes. A change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations.

Compliance with federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as NASDAQ requirements, is becoming increasingly complex, and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business.

Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as NASDAQ rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations. These laws, rules and regulations have increased, and in the future are expected to continue to increase, the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations.

A change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices (or changes in interpretations of such standards, practices or rules) can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective.

New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future. Changes to (or revised interpretations or applications of) existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following tables include selected consolidated summary financial data for each of our last five fiscal years. This data should be read in conjunction with Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

____________

(1)

Our net income decreased to

$366.2 million

in the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, primarily as a result of the impact of the pre-tax net loss of

$131.7 million

for the loss on extinguishment of debt and certain one-time expenses of

$2.5 million

associated with the leveraged recapitalization that was completed during the three months ended December 31, 2014.

(2)

Our long-term debt increased to

$3.17 billion

at the end of fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, because, as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan, we issued

$2.50 billion

aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”), entered into

$750 million

of

five

-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans and a

$500 million

unfunded revolving credit facility and redeemed our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.900% Senior Notes due in 2018 (the “2018 Notes”). Refer to Note 7, “Debt” for additional details. Our total stockholders’ equity decreased to $421.4 million at the end of fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, because, as part of our leveraged recapitalization plan, we declared a special cash dividend of approximately

$2.76 billion

. Refer to Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans” for additional details.

(3)

We early adopted the accounting standard update regarding simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Accordingly, we applied the accounting standard update on a retrospective basis by reclassifying the presentation of the debt issuance costs which was originally included in other current and other non-current assets against the long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

June 30, 2014

, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The change in the classification of the debt issuance costs reduced total assets and total liabilities by

$2.8 million

, $3.6 million, $4.3 million and $5.0 million as of

June 30, 2014

, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. There is no impact to our Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income, Stockholder’s Equity and Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2014

, 2013, 2012 and 2011.



ITEM  7.

MANAGEMENT

’

S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. In general, we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed, is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer. When we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance, we recognize revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:

•

When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.

•

When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due based upon shipment.

•

When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory.

•

When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.

In circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation, the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.

In many instances, products are sold in stand-alone arrangements. Services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts. We have multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. To determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy. For substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services, we use vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third-party evidence (“TPE”) to allocate the selling price to each deliverable. We determine TPE based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a stand-alone basis. When we are unable to establish relative selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price (“ESP”) in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. ESP could potentially be used for new or customized products. We regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. In a multiple element revenue arrangement, we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer. To be considered a separate element, the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting, which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and (b) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. If the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer.

Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.



Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.

Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.

We sell stand-alone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance. We periodically review selling prices to determine whether VSOE exists, and in situations where we are unable to establish VSOE for undelivered elements, such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.

We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for


months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.

The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to such customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.

We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.

Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.

Warranty.

We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for


months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a regular basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.



Stock-Based Compensation.

We account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. The fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable in cash or shares of our common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award). The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. We have elected not to include the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and therefore recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs.

Accounting for Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation.

Cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) awards issued to employees under our Cash LTI program vest in

four

equal installments, with

25%

of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a

four

-year period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. Compensation expense related to the Cash LTI awards is recognized over the vesting term, which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures.

Contingencies and Litigation.

We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 14, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year ended June 30,


and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30,


.

If we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations.

Income Taxes.

We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.



On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

Valuation of Marketable Securities.

Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.

Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted

In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update that provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. Under this accounting standard update, in most circumstances, an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in our financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. This accounting standard update became effective for our interim period ended September 30, 2014, and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding stock-based compensation that clarifies the accounting treatment when terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period ends. The update requires that a performance target that affects vesting that could be achieved after the requisite service period ends be treated as a performance condition. The update is effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued accounting standards update regarding simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. Earlier adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued and we are required to apply the guidance on a retrospective basis with additional disclosure requirements upon transition. We early adopted this accounting standard update in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.



Updates Not Yet Effective

In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from customer contracts to transfer goods and services or non-financial assets, unless the contracts are covered by other standards (for example, insurance or lease contracts). Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The updates are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. In July 2015, the FASB announced a deferral of the effective date by one year, with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for customer’s cloud based fees. The guidance changes what a customer must consider in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license, the customer would account for the fees related to the software license element in accordance with guidance related to internal use software; if the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as a service contract. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for the subsequent measurement of inventory. The amended guidance requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The requirement would replace the current lower of cost or market evaluation and the accounting guidance is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) or the retail inventory method. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, with early adoption permitted to be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

KLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading-edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including the LED and data storage industries, as well as general materials research.

Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and disk manufacturers around the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets - memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions, particularly in the foundry and logic markets, which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market.



As we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. As our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings. We are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable.

The semiconductor industry has also been characterized by constant technological innovation. The growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices in mobile consumer products has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. On the other hand, higher design costs for the most advanced ICs could economically constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment, although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ICs, reuse of installed products, and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes.

The demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ICs that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices. The timing for our customers in ordering and taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment is also determined by our customers’ requirements to meet the next generation production ramp schedules, and the timing for capacity expansion to meet end customer demand. Our earnings will depend not only on our revenue levels, but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers’ technology roadmaps. We have maintained production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory-related and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate. Over the past year, our customers have taken delivery of lower volumes of process control equipment that we had expected. Any delay or push out by our customers in taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment may cause earnings volatility, due to increases in the risk of inventory related charges as well as timing of revenue recognition due to expiration of credits or volume discounts, which, if not used by a stipulated time frame, will expire.

During the most recent quarter, we implemented a plan to reduce our global employee workforce aimed at streamlining our organization and business processes in response to the changing customer requirements in our industry. The goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. We expect to substantially complete the global employee workforce reduction by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, but certain reductions will occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016

.

The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years:

Total revenues during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

decreased by 4% compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

. Revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 reflected our customers’ decline in capital spending for process control equipment, due to shifts in the timing of the new technology ramps and capacity-related expansion plans.

Total revenues during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

increased by 3% compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2013

, as our customers continued to invest in process control and services to improve manufacturing yields as they adopt advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules required to fabricate advanced ICs.



Revenues and Gross Margin

Product revenues

Our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period.

Product revenues decreased by 7% in the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

, primarily as a result of lower revenues from our customers in Taiwan, certain countries in Asia and Europe and Israel, partially offset by higher revenues from our customers in North America, Korea and Japan. The decline in revenues was impacted by the timing of development and new technology ramps of our customers as well as the lower shipments of our products, particularly to our foundry customers in Taiwan, due to timing of capacity-related expansion plans.

Product revenues increased by 2% in the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2013

, as our customers increased their investments in defect inspection capabilities to address the yield challenges caused by the introduction of new technologies and architectures, and added production capacity to meet the growing needs for advanced ICs demanded in an environment of rising global demand for mobile devices.

Service revenues

Service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended June 30,


,


and


, primarily as a result of an increase over time in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over that time period.

Revenues - Top Customers

The following customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the indicated periods:



Revenues by region

Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows:

A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that trend to continue.

Gross margin

Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products, including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions.

The following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage:

Changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.

Our gross margin decreased to

56.8%

during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

from

57.9%

during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

, primarily due to lower volume of products and services, as well as a reduction in manufacturing efficiencies driven by lower manufacturing output and severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, refer to Note 15, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details. The above decreases were partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services sold and efficiencies derived from other service and manufacturing costs.



Our gross margin increased to

57.9%

during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

from

56.5%

during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2013

, primarily due to lower charges for inventory obsolescence as well as manufacturing and service efficiencies, partially offset by a less favorable mix of products and services sold.

Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”)

R&D expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our focused R&D efforts that are aligned with our overall business strategy. Historically, our R&D expenses have generally increased over time, primarily due to higher costs associated with advanced product and technology development projects. We incur significant costs associated with these projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs, and other expenses, as technological innovation is essential to our success. One of the goals of our plan to reduce our global employee workforce is to streamline our organization and business processes and direct our resources toward our best opportunities.

R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

were lower compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

, primarily due to a decrease in engineering materials and consulting costs of $19.8 million associated with the completion of major platform developments, a decrease in depreciation expense of $2.1 million and a decrease in travel expenses of $1.2 million. This was partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $10.6 million mainly as a result of our severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, refer to Note 15, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details. In addition, the decrease was partially offset by a $6.3 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of R&D activities.

R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

were higher compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2013

, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $41.8 million as a result of hiring additional engineering talent and an increase in travel expenses of $2.6 million, as well as a $4.2 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of R&D activities.

R&D expenses include the benefit of

$1.9 million

,

$8.2 million

and

$12.4 million

of external funding received during the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


, respectively, for certain strategic development programs, primarily from government grants.

Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.



Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”)

SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

were higher compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $8.3 million mainly as a result of severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 (refer to Note 15, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details), an increase in cost of support for sales evaluation of $6.5 million, an increase in certain expenses of $2.5 million as a result of our one-time leveraged recapitalization expense that was completed in the three months ended December 31, 2014, a payment related to a contractual settlement for $2.0 million, an increase due to the impairment charge recorded for certain long-lived assets of $1.7 million and an increase in legal fees of $1.6 million. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2013, SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by our receipt of $1.1 million in proceeds from a class action settlement, as well as our recovery of $1.1 million in receivables that had previously been classified as a bad debt expense during the three months ended December 31, 2013, both of which resulted in a decrease of our SG&A expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. The increases described above were partially offset by a decrease in travel related expenses of $4.3 million and a decrease in marketing-related expenses of $1.9 million.

SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

were slightly lower compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2013

, primarily due to lower levels of consulting expenses of $4.5 million and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of $2.6 million as some intangible assets became fully amortized. This was partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $4.4 million as a result of hiring additional personnel.

Restructuring Charges

In April 2015, we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirement in our industry. The goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. We expect to recognize significant cost savings from a number of activities we have recently undertaken, including estimated annual cost savings of approximately

$100 million

of employee related costs as a result of our announced global employee workforce reduction. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a

$31.6 million

net restructuring charge, of which

$8.0 million

was recorded to costs of revenues,

$11.1 million

to engineering, research and development expense and

$12.5 million

to selling, general and administrative expense. A net restructuring charge amounting to

$22.4 million

was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, a substantial majority of which was related to our global workforce reduction plan. Refer to Note 15, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details.

The following table shows the activity primarily related to accrual for severance and benefits expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015:

The accrual for severance and benefits as of June 30, 2015 is expected to be paid out by the end of our fiscal quarter ending December 31,


.

We expect to incur additional charges, including additional severance costs and other related costs, in connection with the completion of our global workforce reduction during the first two quarters of fiscal year 2016

.



Interest Expense and Other Expense (Income), Net

The increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

was primarily attributable to the issuance of

$2.50 billion

aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes and entry into the $750 million unsecured prepayable term loan facility during the three months ended

December 31, 2014

, as compared to $750 million of 2018 Senior Notes for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

. The interest expense during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

remained relatively unchanged compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2013

.

Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies, interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio. Since

June 30, 2014

, our investment balance for our marketable securities portfolio declined by $973 million as a result of our strategic decision to liquidate certain marketable securities in our investment portfolio to fund our working capital requirements. With this decision, our interest income earned from our investment portfolio is expected to decline and the realized gains as a result of liquidation of our investment portfolio are not expected to recur.

The decrease in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

was primarily attributable to a net decline of $4.7 million in gains from the sale of equity investments in privately-held companies, a $1.1 million decrease in interest income from our investment portfolio as a result of our decision to liquidate certain marketable securities and a $1.1 million increase in net foreign currency losses resulting from the volatility of the foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which was partially offset by a decrease in an impairment charge of $1.0 million related to an equity investment in a privately-held company that was deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment and an increase of $0.9 million of realized gains from the investment portfolio liquidation.

The increase in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2013

was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.7 million gain from the sale of an equity investment in a privately-held company, partially offset by an impairment charge of

$1.4 million

recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2013 related to an equity investment in a privately-held company that was deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment, and a decrease in interest income of $1.3 million driven by lower interest rates.

Loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net

For the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net, reflected a pre-tax net loss of

$131.7 million

associated with the redemption of our $750 million of 2018 Senior Notes during the three months ended

December 31, 2014

. Included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net is the

$1.2 million

gain on the non-designated forward contract that was entered into by us in anticipation of the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes, which were redeemed during the

three

months ended

December 31, 2014

. Refer to “Note 7, Debt” and “Note 16, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further details. We had no loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net, in the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2014

and


.



Provision for Income Taxes

The following table provides details of income taxes:

The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates, tax credits, and other domestic incentives.

Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

was

15.7%

compared to

20.7%

for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

. Tax expense as a percentage of income decreased primarily due to an increase in our research and development credits, an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction as a percentage of income, and a decrease in the percentage of income earned in the U.S. as a result of the loss on extinguishment of debt compared to income earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.

Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

was

20.7%

compared to

21.4%

for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2013

. Tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in tax reserves and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, partially offset by a decrease in our research and development credits and an increase in tax expense related to employee stock activity.

Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.

In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. We are under a United States federal income tax examination for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:

As of

June 30, 2015

, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled

$2.39 billion

, which is a decrease of

$766 million

from

June 30, 2014

. The decrease is primarily attributable to payment of a special cash dividend of approximately

$2.72 billion

, payment of regular quarterly cash dividends of

$324.8 million

, payment for the redemption of our 2018 Senior Notes of

$877.4 million

, payment for stock repurchases of

$602.9 million

, payment of principal amount and prepayment of term loans and interest with respect to Senior Notes, term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility aggregating to

$98.3 million

, payment of interest up to the redemption date with respect to our 2018 Senior Notes of

$32.8 million

, partially offset by net proceeds of an aggregate of

$3.22 billion

from our issuance of Senior Notes, borrowings under our five-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans under our Credit Facility, and net proceeds from cash generated from operating activities. As of

June 30, 2015

,

$1.47 billion

of our

$2.39 billion

of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to permanently reinvest $1.34 billion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We have accrued (but have not paid) U.S. taxes on the remaining cash of $136.3 million of the

$1.47 billion

held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense.

Cash Dividends and Special Cash Dividend:

The total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


was

$324.8 million

,

$298.9 million

and

$265.9 million

, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from

$0.45

to

$0.50

per share that was instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2014. The amount of accrued dividends payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights was

$0.9 million

as of

June 30, 2015

. We did not have accrued dividends payable in the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2014

and


. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested restricted stock units as described in Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans.” On

July 14, 2015

, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly cash dividend from

$0.50

to

$0.52

per share. Refer to Note 19, “Subsequent Events” for additional information regarding the quarterly cash dividend increase announced subsequent to June 30, 2015.



On November 19, 2014, we declared a special cash dividend of

$16.50

per share on our outstanding common stock which was paid on December 9, 2014 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2014. Additionally, in connection with the special cash dividend, our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a proportionate and equitable adjustment to outstanding equity awards (restricted stock units and stock options) under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”), as required by the 2004 Plan, subject to the vesting requirements of the underlying awards. As the adjustment was required by the 2004 Plan, the adjustment to the outstanding awards did not result in any incremental compensation expense due to modification of such awards, under the authoritative guidance. The declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in Note 7, “Debt” that was completed during the

three

months ended

December 31, 2014

. The total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by the Company during the

three

months ended

December 31, 2014

was approximately

$2.76 billion

, substantially all of which was paid out during the

three

months ended

December 31, 2014

. As of

June 30, 2015

, we have

$41.1 million

accrued dividends payable for the special cash dividend with respect to outstanding unvested restricted stock units, which will be paid when such underlying unvested restricted stock units vest as described in detail in Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans.” We did not declare any special cash dividend in the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2014

and


. Other than the special cash dividend declared during the

three

months ended

December 31, 2014

, we historically have not declared any special cash dividends.

Stock Repurchases:

The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

compared to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

. The stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our ESPP program, the vesting of employee restricted stock units and the exercise of employee stock options.

Debt Issuance - Senior Notes:

In November 2014, we issued

$2.50 billion

aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”). We issued the Senior Notes as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan under which the proceeds from the Senior Notes in conjunction with the proceeds from the term loans (described below) and cash on hand were used (x) to fund a special cash dividend of

$16.50

per share, aggregating to approximately

$2.76 billion

, (y) to redeem

$750 million

of


Senior Notes, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses and (z) for other general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares pursuant to our stock repurchase program. The interest rate specified for each series of the Senior Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s or S&P, as the case may be (a “Substitute Rating Agency”), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of Senior Notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade. If the adjusted rating of any series of Senior Notes from Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) is decreased to Ba1, Ba2, Ba3 or B1 or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively (“bps” refers to Basis Points and 1% is equal to 100 bps). If the rating of any series of Senior Notes from S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to such series of Senior Notes is decreased to BB+, BB, BB- or B+ or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively. The interest rates on any series of Senior Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) if such series of Senior Notes becomes rated “Baa1” (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) and “BBB+” (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if rated by only one of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. In October 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (“benchmark rate”) on a portion of the Senior Notes with a notional amount of

$1.00 billion

in aggregate. For additional details, refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

The original discount on the Senior Notes amounted to

$4.0 million

and is being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable

semi-annually

on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The debt indenture (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on its facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. As of

June 30, 2015

, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.

Debt Issuance - Credit Facility (Term Loans and Unfunded Revolving Credit Facility):

In November 2014, we entered into

$750 million

of five-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans and a

$500 million

unfunded revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Credit Facility”) under the Credit Agreement. The interest under the Credit Facility will be payable on the borrowed amounts at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, which is currently 125 bps, and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades by Moody’s and S&P. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the then effective credit rating. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. Principal payments with respect to the term loans will be made on the last day of each calendar quarter and any unpaid principal balance of the term loans, including accrued interest, shall be payable on November 14, 2019 (the “Maturity Date”). We may prepay the term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, the Company prepaid additional principal of

$20.0 million

in addition to the scheduled quarterly payments for the term loans.

Future principal payments for the term loans (without giving effect for any prepayments made)  as of

June 30, 2015

, are as follows:



The Credit Facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing

four

consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than

3.50

to 1.00. In addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing

four

consecutive fiscal quarters for the fiscal quarters as described below.

We were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of

June 30, 2015

(the interest expense coverage ratio was 7.93 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 3.82 to 1.00) and had no outstanding borrowings under the unfunded revolving credit facility. Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the term loans, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our first quarter of fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.

Debt Redemption:

In December 2014, we redeemed the

$750 million

aggregate principal amount of 2018 Senior Notes. The redemption resulted in a pre-tax net loss on extinguishment of debt of

$131.7 million

for the three months ended

December 31, 2014

, which includes

$1.2 million

of gain upon the termination of the non-designated forward contract described below.

In addition, in November 2014, we entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate to be used for determining the redemption amount in connection with our redemption of the then outstanding 2018 Senior Notes that occurred during the three months ended

December 31, 2014

. The notional amount of the non-designated forward contract was

$750 million

. For additional details, refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”



Contractual Obligations

The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of

June 30, 2015

:

__________________

(1)

In November 2014, we issued

$750 million

aggregate principal amount of term loans due in fiscal year 2020 (outstanding balance of

$711.3 million

as of June 30, 2015) and

$2.50 billion

aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2035.

(2)

The interest payments associated with the Senior Notes obligations included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable coupon rate for each series of Senior Notes. Our future interest payments are subject to change if our then effective credit rating is below investment grade as discussed above. The interest payments under the term loans are payable on the borrowed amounts at the LIBOR plus 125 bps. As of

June 30, 2015

, we utilized the existing interest rates to project our estimated term loans interest payments for the next five years. The interest payment under the revolving credit facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 15 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. Our future interest payments for the term loans and the revolving credit facility are subject to change due to future fluctuations in the LIBOR rates as well as any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating.

(3)

Represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with other goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.

(4)

Represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.

(5)

Represents the amount committed under our cash long-term incentive program. The expected payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately

$101.8 million

.

(6)

Represents the amount committed under our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant’s separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections.

(7)

Represents the amount committed for accrued dividends payable, substantially all of which are for the special cash dividend for the unvested restricted stock units as of the dividend record date as well as restricted stock units granted with dividend equivalent rights. For additional details, refer to Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans”.



Starting in fiscal year 2013 we adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. In order to receive payments under the Cash LTI Plan, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date.

We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods.

The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods:

Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.

We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to

$22.5 million

, of which

$19.0 million

had been issued as of

June 30, 2015

, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia.

We maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately

$298.7 million

as of

June 30, 2015

and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.

We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hours per week coverage for 12 months. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.

Working Capital:

Working capital was

$2.90 billion

as of

June 30, 2015

, which was a decrease of

$787.7 million

compared to our working capital as of

June 30, 2014

. The decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to payment of a special cash dividend of approximately

$2.72 billion

, payment of regular quarterly cash dividends of

$324.8 million

, payment for the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes of

$877.4 million

, payment for stock repurchases of

$602.9 million

, payment of principal amount and prepayment of term loans and interest with respect to Senior Notes, term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility aggregating to

$98.3 million

, payment of interest up to the redemption date with respect to our 2018 Senior Notes of

$32.8 million

, partially offset by the aggregate of net proceeds of

$3.22 billion

from the issuance of Senior Notes and borrowings under our prepayable term loans. As of

June 30, 2015

, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of

$2.39 billion

of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $500 million unfunded revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months.



Our credit ratings and outlooks as of

June 30, 2015

are summarized below:

Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Under our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 16 months, were as follows:

In October 2014, in anticipation of the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into a series of forward contracts (“Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the Senior Notes. The objective of the Rate Lock Agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing, on the notional amount being hedged. The Rate Lock Agreements had a notional amount of

$1 billion

in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

. We designated each of the Rate Lock Agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge, under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the close out of the Rate Lock Agreements was initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a reduction of total stockholders’ equity and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. The ineffective portion, if any, was recognized in earnings immediately. The Rate Lock Agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the

$1.25 billion

of

4.650%

Senior Notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of a

$7.5 million

receivable as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of

December 31, 2014

. For the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, we recognized

$0.5 million

for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which amount reduced the interest expense. We did not record any ineffectiveness for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

. The cash proceeds of

$7.5 million

from the settlement of the Rate Lock Agreements were included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

because the designated hedged item was classified as interest expense in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

In addition, in November 2014, we entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate used to determine the redemption amount of the 2018 Senior Notes that occurred during the three months ended

December 31, 2014

. The objective of the forward contract was to hedge the risk associated with the variability of the redemption amount due to changes in interest rates through the redemption of the existing 2018 Senior Notes. The forward contract had a notional amount of

$750 million

. The forward contract was terminated in December 2014 and the resulting fair value of

$1.2 million

receivable was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net line in the consolidated statements of operations, partially offsetting the loss on redemption of the debt during the three months ended

December 31, 2014

. The cash proceeds from the forward contract were included in the cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, partially offsetting the cash outflows for the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes.



Indemnification Obligations.

Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.

We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights used in our products and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us.

In addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, service response time and other commitments. Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. To date, we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future.

It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



ITEM  7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of

June 30, 2015

. Actual results may differ materially.

As of

June 30, 2015

, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.65 billion. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in fair value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of

June 30, 2015

, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $18.1 million.

In November 2014, we issued

$2.50 billion

aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”) due in various fiscal years ranging from 2018 to 2035. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of

June 30, 2015

, the book value of our Senior Notes of

$2.50 billion

approximates the fair value. Additionally, the interest expense for the Senior Notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. Following a rating change below investment grade, the stated interest rate for each series of Senior Notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. Refer to Note 7, “Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,

“Liquidity and Capital Resources,”

in Part II, Item 7 for additional details. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. As of

June 30, 2015

, if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by Moody’s and S&P, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the Senior Notes, considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our Senior Notes, is estimated to be approximately $50.0 million.

In November 2014, we entered into

$750 million

aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior, unsecured prepayable term loans due in 2019 and a

$500 million

unfunded revolving credit facility. The interest rates for the term loans are based on LIBOR plus a fixed spread and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. The fair value of the term loans is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with change in interest rates. As of

June 30, 2015

, the difference between book value and fair value of our term loans was immaterial. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the unfunded revolving credit facility which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. As of

June 30, 2015

, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 bps, the change would increase our annual interest expense annually by approximately $6.3 million as it relates to our borrowings under the term loans. Additionally, as of

June 30, 2015

, if our credit rating was downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense for the term loans and the revolving credit facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $4.1 million.

See Note 4, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of

June 30, 2015

.

As of

June 30, 2015

, we had net forward and option contracts to sell

$115.1 million

in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). If we had entered into these contracts on

June 30, 2015

, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $115.1 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $23.9 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1— SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Operations and Principles of Consolidation.

KLA-Tencor Corporation (“KLA-Tencor” or the “Company”) is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Headquartered in Milpitas, California, KLA-Tencor has subsidiaries both in the United States and in key markets throughout the world.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of KLA-Tencor and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Management Estimates.

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying the Company’s accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities) at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities.

All highly liquid debt instruments with original or remaining maturities of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities are generally classified as available-for-sale for use in current operations, if required, and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, presented as a separate component of stockholders’ equity under the caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” All realized gains and losses and unrealized losses resulting from declines in fair value that are other than temporary are recorded in earnings in the period of occurrence. The specific identification method is used to determine the realized gains and losses on investments. For all investments in debt and equity securities, the Company assesses whether the impairment is other than temporary. If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis, an impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) the Company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (ii) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (i), the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (ii), the amount representing credit losses, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors such as duration and severity of the unrealized losses, credit ratings, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities and Other Investments.

KLA-Tencor acquires certain equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives, and, to the extent these investments continue to have strategic value, the Company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate the inherent market risks. Non-marketable equity securities and other investments are recorded at historical cost. Non-marketable equity securities and other investments are included in “Other non-current assets” on the balance sheet. Non-marketable equity securities are subject to a periodic impairment review; however, there are no open-market valuations, and the impairment analysis requires significant judgment. This analysis includes assessment of the investee’s financial condition, the business outlook for its products and technology, its projected results and cash flow, the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by the Company or others.

Variable Interest Entities.

KLA-Tencor uses a qualitative approach in assessing the consolidation requirement for variable interest entities. The approach focuses on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s economic performance and which enterprise has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity. In the event that the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the variable interest entity will be included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has concluded that none of the Company’s equity investments require consolidation as per the Company’s most recent qualitative assessment.



Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. The Company reviews and sets standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. The Company’s manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. The Company writes down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

A majority of the Company’s trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon the Company’s assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table sets forth the estimated useful life for various asset categories:

Construction-in-process assets are not depreciated until the assets are placed in service. Depreciation expense for the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


was

$55.8 million

,

$51.1 million

and

$49.3 million

, respectively.

Business Combinations.

KLA-Tencor allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration of the Company’s acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When a project underlying reported IPR&D is completed, the corresponding amount of IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

KLA-Tencor assesses goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” for a detailed description.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

KLA-Tencor evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. Such an impairment charge would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

Financial instruments that potentially subject KLA-Tencor to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, trade accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities. The Company invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as, but not limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate debt and municipal securities, United States Treasury and Government agency securities, and equity securities and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. The Company has not experienced any material credit losses on its investments.



A majority of the Company’s trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers located throughout the world, with a majority located in Asia. In recent years, the Company’s customer base has become increasingly concentrated due to corporate consolidation, acquisitions and business closures, and to the extent that these customers experience liquidity issues in the future, the Company may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to trade receivables. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral to secure accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses based upon expected collectibility risk of all accounts receivable. In addition, the Company may utilize letters of credit or non-recourse factoring to mitigate credit risk when considered appropriate.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties on the foreign exchange contracts that the Company uses in hedging activities and in certain factoring transactions. These counterparties are large international financial institutions, and to date no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company under such contracts.

The following customers each accounted for more than

10%

of total revenues for the indicated periods:

The following customers each accounted for more than

10%

of net accounts receivable as of the dates indicated below:

Foreign Currency.

The functional currencies of KLA-Tencor’s foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies, except as described below. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars at current period end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period. The gains and losses from foreign currency translation of these subsidiaries’ financial statements are recorded directly into a separate component of stockholders’ equity under the caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

The Company’s manufacturing subsidiaries in Singapore, Israel, Germany and China use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Accordingly, monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currency of these subsidiaries are remeasured using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenues and costs in local currency are remeasured using average exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are remeasured using historical exchange rates. The resulting remeasurement gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

KLA-Tencor uses financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and currency options, to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions. The purpose of the Company’s foreign currency program is to manage the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items. The Company believes these financial instruments do not subject the Company to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates.



All of the Company’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable instruments adjusted for risk of counterparty non-performance. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within twelve months, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” in stockholders’ equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is (or becomes) ineffective, the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gains or losses on these hedges are recorded immediately in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

Warranty.

The Company provides standard warranty coverage on its systems for


hours per week for


months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. The Company accounts for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, the Company calculates the average service hours and parts expense per system and applies the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. The Company updates these estimated charges on a regular basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases the Company adjusts its warranty accruals accordingly (see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies”).

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company derives revenue from

three

sources-sales of systems, spare parts and services. In general, the Company recognizes revenue for systems when the system has been installed, is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer. When the Company has demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance. Under certain circumstances, however, the Company recognizes revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:

•

When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when the Company can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.

•

When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due based upon shipment.

•

When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory.

•

When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.

In circumstances in which the Company recognizes revenue prior to installation, the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.

In many instances, products are sold in stand-alone arrangements. Services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts. The Company has multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. To determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement, the Company allocates arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy. For substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services, the Company uses vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third-party evidence (“TPE”) to allocate the selling price to each deliverable. The Company determines TPE based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a stand-alone basis. When the Company is unable to establish relative selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company uses estimated selling price (“ESP”) in its allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. ESP could potentially be used for new or customized products. The Company regularly reviews relative selling prices and maintains internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates.

In a multiple element revenue arrangement, the Company defers revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer. To be considered a separate element, the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting, which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and (b) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered

item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company. If the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer.



Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. The Company estimates the value of the trade-in right and reduces the revenue recognized on the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.

Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.

Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.

The Company sells stand-alone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance. The Company periodically reviews selling prices to determine whether VSOE exists, and in situations where the Company is unable to establish VSOE for undelivered elements, such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.

The Company also defers the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard


-hour per week coverage for


months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.

The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met the Company’s revenue recognition criteria. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to such customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.

Research and Development Costs.

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Strategic Development Agreements.

Gross engineering, research and development expenses were partially offset by

$1.9 million

,

$8.2 million

and

$12.4 million

in external funding received under certain strategic development programs, primarily from government grants, in the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


, respectively.

Shipping and Handling Costs.

Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans.

The Company accounts for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. The fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The award holder is not entitled to received payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award). The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of the Company’s common stock. The Company has elected not to include the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and therefore recognizes the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs.

Accounting for Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation.

Cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) awards issued to employees under the Company’s Cash LTI program vest in

four

equal installments, with

25%

of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a

four

-year period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by the Company as of the applicable award vesting date. Compensation expense related to the Cash LTI awards is recognized over the vesting term, which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures.



Accounting for Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan.

The Company has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (known as “Executive Deferred Savings Plan”) under which certain executives and non-employee directors may defer a portion of their compensation. Participants are credited with returns based on their allocation of their account balances among measurement funds. The Company controls the investment of these funds, and the participants remain general creditors of the Company. The Company invests these funds in certain mutual funds and such investments are classified as trading securities on the consolidated balance sheets. Distributions from the Executive Deferred Savings Plan commence following a participant’s retirement or termination of employment or on a specified date allowed per the Executive Deferred Savings Plan provisions, except in cases where such distributions are required to be delayed in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Participants can generally elect the distributions to be paid in lump sum or quarterly cash payments over a scheduled period for up to

15 years

and are allowed to make subsequent changes to their existing elections as permissible under the Executive Deferred Savings Plan provisions. The liability associated with the Executive Deferred Savings Plan is included as a component of other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the Executive Deferred Savings Plan liability is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The changes in the liability included in selling, general and administrative expense were

$10.4 million

,

$24.4 million

and

$14.2 million

for the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


respectively. The Company also has a deferred compensation asset that corresponds to the liability under the Executive Deferred Savings Plan and it is included as a component of other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the Executive Deferred Savings Plan assets are recorded as gains (losses), net in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The amount of gains (losses), net included in selling, general and administrative expense were

$10.4 million

,

$24.8 million

and

$14.1 million

for the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


, respectively.

Advertising Expenses.

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes.

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against certain deferred tax assets, but it anticipates that its future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of its deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in the Company’s ability to recover its deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, the Company could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to the Company’s tax provision in the period in which the Company determines that the recovery is not probable.

The Company applies a two-step approach, based on authoritative guidance, to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

Earnings Per Share.

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share when a net loss is recorded for the period as their effect would be anti-dilutive.

Contingencies and Litigation.

The Company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company accrues a liability and recognizes as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 14, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” for a detailed description.

Reclassifications.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income, Stockholder’s Equity and Cash Flows.

In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update that provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. Under this accounting standard update, in most circumstances, an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the Company’s financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. This accounting standard update became effective for the Company’s interim period ended September 30, 2014, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding stock-based compensation that clarifies the accounting treatment when terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period ends. The update requires that a performance target that affects vesting that could be achieved after the requisite service period ends be treated as a performance condition. The update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued accounting standards update regarding simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. Earlier adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued and the Company is required to apply the guidance on a retrospective basis with additional disclosure requirements upon transition. The Company early adopted this accounting standard update in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Updates Not Yet Effective

In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from customer contracts to transfer goods and services or non-financial assets unless the contracts are covered by other standards (for example, insurance or lease contracts). Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The updates are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. In July 2015, the FASB announced a deferral of the effective date by one year, with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for customer’s cloud based fees. The guidance changes what a customer must consider in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license, the customer would account for the fees related to the software license element in accordance with guidance related to internal use software; if the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as a service contract. The update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for the subsequent measurement of inventory. The amended guidance requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The requirement would replace the current lower of cost or market evaluation and the accounting guidance is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) or the retail inventory method. The update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, with early adoption permitted to be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.



NOTE 2 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value, except for certain equity investments in privately-held companies. These equity investments are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. The Company’s non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and land, property and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

KLA-Tencor has evaluated the estimated fair value of financial instruments using available market information and valuations as provided by third-party sources. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The fair value of the Company’s cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these items.

Fair Value Hierarchy.

The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company’s financial instruments were classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of

June 30, 2015

, because they were valued using quoted market prices, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. As of

June 30, 2015

, the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets included money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, certain sovereign securities and certain U.S. Government agency securities. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

As of

June 30, 2015

, the types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs included corporate debt securities, municipal securities and certain U.S. Government agency securities and sovereign securities. The market inputs used to value these instruments generally consist of market yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The principal market in which the Company executes its foreign currency contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency. The market participants usually are large financial institutions. The Company’s foreign currency contracts’ valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment. These contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

NOTE 3 — FINANCIAL STATEMENT COMPONENTS

Consolidated Balance Sheets



__________________

(1)

Other current assets and other non-current assets balances as of June 30, 2014 on the consolidated balance sheet were adjusted to exclude the debt issuance costs as a result of early adoption of the accounting standards update regarding simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. See Note 7, “Debt” for additional details.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) as of the dates indicated below were as follows:

The effects on net income of amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the indicated periods were as follows (in thousands):

The amounts reclassified out of accumulated OCI related to the Company’s defined pension plans, which were recognized as a component of net periodic cost for the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

and


were

$1.3 million

and

$1.3 million

, respectively. For additional details, refer to Note 11, “Employee Benefit Plans.”

NOTE 4 — MARKETABLE SECURITIES

The amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities as of the dates indicated below were as follows:

__________________

(1) Time deposits excluded from fair value measurements.



KLA-Tencor’s investment portfolio consists of both corporate and government securities that have a maximum maturity of

three years

. The longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. All unrealized losses are due to changes in market interest rates, bond yields and/or credit ratings. The Company believes that it has the ability to realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity. The following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized losses of the Company’s investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of the date indicated below:

__________________

(1)

As of

June 30, 2015

, the amount of total gross unrealized losses related to investments that had been in a continuous loss position for


months or more was immaterial.

The contractual maturities of securities classified as available-for-sale, regardless of their classification on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as of the date indicated below were as follows:

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Realized gains on available for sale securities for the fiscal years ended June 30,


,


and


were

$2.4 million

,

$2.2 million

and

$2.5 million

, respectively. Realized losses on available for sale securities for the fiscal year ended June 30,

and


were

$0.3 million

,

$0.1 million

and

, respectively.

NOTE 5 – BUSINESS COMBINATION

On

March 28, 2014

, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of a privately-held company that developed and sold software to mask manufacturers, semiconductor fabs and mask inspection and review equipment manufacturers, for a total purchase consideration of

$18.0 million

in cash.

The following table represents the purchase price allocation and summarizes the aggregate fair values of the net assets acquired on the closing date of the acquisition:

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The

$8.7 million

of goodwill was assigned to the Defect Inspection reporting unit.



NOTE 6 — GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

The following table presents goodwill balances and the movements during the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

and


:

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in prior business combinations. The Company has

four

reporting units: Defect Inspection, Metrology, Service and Other. As of June 30,


, substantially all of the goodwill balance resided within the Defect Inspection reporting unit.

The changes in the gross goodwill balance during the fiscal year ended June 30,


resulted from foreign currency translation adjustments. The changes in the gross goodwill balance during the fiscal year ended June 30,


resulted from the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of a privately-held company and foreign currency translation adjustments.

The Company performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of November 30,


and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amount. In assessing the qualitative factors, the Company considered the impact of key factors including change in industry and competitive environment, market capitalization, stock price, earnings multiples, budgeted-to-actual revenue performance from prior year, gross margin and cash flow from operating activities. As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test at that time. In addition, there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the qualitative assessment performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30,


. The next annual assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30,


.

Purchased Intangible Assets

The components of purchased intangible assets as of the dates indicated below were as follows:

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.



For the fiscal years ended June 30,


,


and


, amortization expense for other intangible assets was

$15.8 million

,

$16.2 million

and

$20.8 million

, respectively. Based on the intangible assets recorded as of

June 30, 2015

, and assuming no subsequent additions to, or impairment of, the underlying assets, the remaining estimated annual amortization expense is expected to be as follows:

NOTE 7 — DEBT

The following table summarizes the debt of the Company as of

June 30, 2015

and

June 30, 2014

:

__________________

(1)

The effective interest rate disclosed above for this series of Senior Notes excludes the impact of the treasury rate lock hedge discussed below. The effective interest rate including the impact of the treasury rate lock hedge was

4.626%

.

(2)

The Company early adopted the accounting standard update regarding simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Accordingly, the Company applied the accounting standard update on a retrospective basis by reclassifying the presentation of the debt issuance costs totaling

$2.8 million

which was originally included in other current and other non-current assets against the long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

June 30, 2014

. The change in the classification of the debt issuance costs reduced total assets and total liabilities by

$2.8 million

as of

June 30, 2014

. There is no impact to the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income, Stockholder’s Equity and Cash Flows for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

.



As of

June 30, 2015

, future principal payments for long-term debt, including the current portion, are summarized as follows.

Debt Issuance - Senior Notes:

In November 2014, the Company issued

$2.50 billion

aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”). The Company issued the Senior Notes as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan under which the proceeds from the Senior Notes in conjunction with the proceeds from the term loans (described below) and cash on hand were used (x) to fund a special cash dividend of

$16.50

per share, aggregating to approximately

$2.76 billion

, (y) to redeem

$750 million

of


Senior Notes, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses and (z) for other general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares pursuant to the Company’s stock repurchase program. The interest rate specified for each series of the Senior Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s or S&P, as the case may be (a “Substitute Rating Agency”), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of Senior Notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade. If the adjusted rating of any series of Senior Notes from Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) is decreased to Ba1, Ba2, Ba3 or B1 or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by

25 bps

,

50 bps

,

75 bps

or

100 bps

, respectively (“bps” refers to Basis Points and 1% is equal to 100 bps). If the rating of any series of Senior Notes from S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to such series of Senior Notes is decreased to BB+, BB, BB- or B+ or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by

25 bps

,

50 bps

,

75 bps

or

100 bps

, respectively. The interest rates on any series of Senior Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) if such series of Senior Notes becomes rated “Baa1” (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) and “BBB+” (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if rated by only one of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. In October 2014, the Company entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (“benchmark rate”) on a portion of the Senior Notes with a notional amount of

$1.00 billion

in aggregate. For additional details, refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

The original discount on the Senior Notes amounted to

$4.0 million

and is being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable

semi-annually

on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The debt indenture (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit the Company’s ability to grant liens on its facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. As of

June 30, 2015

, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.

In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of Senior Notes by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch Inc., unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Senior Notes of such series, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s Senior Notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”). In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to

101%

of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase.

Based on the trading prices of the Senior Notes on the applicable dates, the fair value of the Senior Notes as of

June 30, 2015

and

June 30, 2014

was

$2.52 billion

and

$893.7 million

, respectively. While the Senior Notes are recorded at cost, the fair value of the long-term debt was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active; accordingly, the long-term debt is categorized as Level 2 for purposes of the fair value measurement hierarchy.



Debt Issuance - Credit Facility (Term Loans and Unfunded Revolving Credit Facility):

In November 2014, the Company entered into

$750 million

of

five

-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans and a

$500 million

unfunded revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Credit Facility”) under the Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The interest under the Credit Facility will be payable on the borrowed amounts at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, which is currently

125 bps

, and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with the Company’s credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The spread ranges from

100 bps

to

175 bps

based on the then effective credit rating. The Company is also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of

15 bps

on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with the Company’s credit rating downgrades or upgrades by Moody’s and S&P. The annual commitment fee ranges from

10 bps

to

25 bps

on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. Principal payments with respect to the term loans will be made on the last day of each calendar quarter, and any unpaid principal balance of the term loans, including accrued interest, shall be payable on November 14, 2019 (the “Maturity Date”). The Company may prepay the term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, the Company prepaid additional principal of

$20.0 million

in addition to the scheduled quarterly payments for the term loans.

Future principal payments for the Company’s term loans (without giving effect for any prepayments made) as of

June 30, 2015

, are as follows:

The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing

four

consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than

3.50

to 1.00. In addition, the Company is required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing

four

consecutive fiscal quarters for the fiscal quarters as described below.

The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of

June 30, 2015

and had no outstanding borrowings under the unfunded revolving credit facility.

Debt Redemption:

In December 2014, the Company redeemed the

$750 million

aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Senior Notes. The redemption resulted in a pre-tax net loss on extinguishment of debt of

$131.7 million

for the three months ended

December 31, 2014

after an offset of a

$1.2 million

gain upon the termination of the non-designated forward contract entered by the Company in November 2014. The objective of entering into the non-designated forward contract was to lock the treasury rate used to determine the redemption amount of the 2018 Senior Notes. The notional amount of the non-designated forward contract was

$750 million

. Refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”



NOTE 8 — EQUITY AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS

Equity Incentive Program

As of

June 30, 2015

, the Company had

two

plans under which the Company was able to issue equity incentive awards, such as restricted stock units and stock options, to its employees, consultants and members of its Board of Directors: the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”) and the 1998 Director Plan (the “Outside Director Plan”).

2004 Plan:

The 2004 Plan provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units to the Company’s employees, consultants and members of its Board of Directors. As of

June 30, 2015

,

6.1 million

shares were available for issuance under the 2004 Plan.

Any 2004 Plan awards of restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units or deferred stock units with a per share or unit purchase price lower than

100%

of fair market value on the grant date are counted against the total number of shares issuable under the 2004 Plan as follows, based on the grant date of the applicable award: (a) for any such awards granted before November 6, 2013, the awards counted against the 2004 Plan share reserve as

1.8

shares for every one share subject thereto; and (b) for any such awards granted on or after November 6, 2013, the awards count against the 2004 Plan share reserve as

2.0

shares for every

one share

subject thereto.

In addition, in November 2013, the Company’s stockholders also approved amendments to the 2004 Plan that included, among other things, giving the plan administrator the ability to grant “dividend equivalent” rights in connection with awards of restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units before they are fully vested. It allows the plan administrator, at its discretion, to grant a right to receive dividends on the aforementioned awards which may be settled in cash or Company stock at the discretion of the plan administrator subject to meeting the vesting requirement of the underlying awards.

Outside Director Plan

The Outside Director Plan only permits the issuance of stock options to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors. As of

June 30, 2015

,

1.7 million

shares were available for grant under the Outside Director Plan.



Equity Incentive Plans - General Information

The following table summarizes the combined activity under the Company’s equity incentive plans for the indicated periods:

__________________

(1)

The number of restricted stock units provided in this row reflects the application of the award multiplier as described above (

1.8

x or

2.0

x depending on the grant date of the applicable award).

(2)

Represents the portion of shares listed as “Options canceled/expired/forfeited” above that were issued under the Company’s equity incentive plans other than the 2004 Plan and the Outside Director Plan. Because the Company is only currently authorized to issue equity awards under the 2004 Plan and the Outside Director Plan, any equity awards that are canceled, expired or forfeited under any other Company equity incentive plan do not result in additional shares being available to the Company for future grant.

(3)

Includes restricted stock units granted to senior management during the applicable fiscal year with performance-based vesting criteria (in addition to service-based vesting criteria for any of such restricted stock units that are deemed to have been earned). As of

June 30, 2015

, it had not yet been determined the extent to which (if at all) the performance-based vesting criteria of such restricted stock units had been satisfied. Therefore, this line item includes all such performance-based restricted stock units granted during such fiscal year, reported at the maximum possible number of shares that may ultimately be issuable under such restricted stock units if all applicable performance-based criteria are achieved at their maximum levels and all applicable service-based criteria are fully satisfied (i.e.,

0.6 million

shares for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013,

0.6 million

shares for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

and

0.6 million

shares for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, which, in each case reflects the application of the

1.8

x or

2.0

x multiplier described above). The Company has granted only restricted stock units under its equity incentive program since October 2007, except the number of shares subject to outstanding options under the 2004 Plan was adjusted during the three months ended

December 31, 2014

due to a proportionate and equitable adjustment under the 2004 Plan provisions as discussed below. For the preceding several years until October 31, 2007, stock options were granted at the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant generally with vesting period terms ranging from

one

to

five years

. Restricted stock units may be granted with varying criteria such as service-based and/or performance-based vesting.



(4)

During the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, the Company adjusted the number of shares subject to outstanding options under the 2004 Plan by an aggregate of

4,245

shares pursuant to a proportionate and equitable adjustment for the effect of the special cash dividend, as required by the 2004 Plan. The total number of outstanding options under the 2004 Plan as well as the associated exercise prices were adjusted to ensure the aggregate intrinsic value remained the same after considering the effect of the special cash dividend. As the adjustment was required by the 2004 Plan, under the authoritative guidance, the adjustment to the outstanding awards did not result in any incremental compensation expense. Additionally, the adjustment did not have an impact on the shares available for future issuance under the 2004 Plan.

The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period. For restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights, fair value is calculated using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on those restricted stock units. In November 2013, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the 2004 Plan that included, among other things, giving the plan administrator the ability to grant “dividend equivalent” rights in connection with awards of restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units before they are fully vested as discussed above. The fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.

As of June 30, 2015

, the Company accrued

$42.0 million

of dividends payable, substantially all of which is related to the special cash dividend for the unvested restricted stock units outstanding as of the dividend record date as well as restricted stock units granted with dividend equivalent rights during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, which entitle the holders of such equity awards to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock subject to meeting the vesting requirements of the underlying equity awards. The fair value for purchase rights under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model.

The following table shows pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the indicated periods:

The following table shows stock-based compensation capitalized as inventory as of the dates indicated below:

Stock Options

The following table summarizes the activity and weighted-average exercise price for stock options under all plans during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

:



The Company has not issued any stock options since October 2007. However, during the

three

months ended

December 31, 2014

, the Company adjusted the number of shares subject to outstanding options under the 2004 Plan by an aggregate of

4,245

shares pursuant to a proportionate and equitable adjustment for the effect of the special cash dividend, as required by the 2004 Plan. The total number of outstanding options under the 2004 Plan as well as the associated exercise prices were adjusted to ensure the aggregate intrinsic value remained the same after considering the effect of the special cash dividend. As the adjustment was required by the 2004 Plan, the adjustment to the outstanding awards did not result in any incremental compensation expense due to modification of such awards, under the authoritative guidance. Additionally, the adjustment did not have an impact on the shares available for future issuance under the 2004 Plan.

The following table shows the total intrinsic value of options exercised, total cash received from employees and non-employee Board members as a result of stock option exercises and tax benefits realized by the Company in connection with these stock option exercises for the indicated periods:

The Company generally settles employee stock option exercises with newly issued common shares, except in certain tax jurisdictions where settling such exercises with treasury shares provides the Company or one of its subsidiaries with a tax benefit.

Restricted Stock Units

The following table shows the applicable number of restricted stock units and weighted-average grant date fair value for restricted stock units granted, vested and released, withheld for taxes, and forfeited during the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

and restricted stock units outstanding as of

(1)

Share numbers reflect actual shares subject to awarded restricted stock units. As described above, under the terms of the 2004 Plan, the number of shares subject to each award reflected in this number is multiplied by either

1.8

x or

2.0

x (depending on the grant date of the award) to calculate the impact of the award on the share reserve under the 2004 Plan.

(2)

Includes restricted stock units granted to senior management during the applicable fiscal year with performance-based vesting criteria (in addition to service-based vesting criteria for any of such restricted stock units that are deemed to have been earned). As of

June 30, 2015

, it had not yet been determined the extent to which (if at all) the performance-based vesting criteria of such restricted stock units had been satisfied. Therefore, this line item includes all such performance-based restricted stock units, reported at the maximum possible number of shares (i.e.,

0.3 million

shares for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013,

0.3 million

shares for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 and

0.3 million

shares for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

) that may ultimately be issuable under such restricted stock units if all applicable performance-based criteria are achieved at their maximum and all applicable service-based criteria are fully satisfied .



The restricted stock units granted by the Company since the beginning of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 generally vest (a) with respect to awards with only service-based vesting criteria, in

four

equal installments on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date and (b) with respect to awards with both performance-based and service-based vesting criteria, in

two

equal installments on the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date, in each case subject to the recipient remaining employed by the Company as of the applicable vesting date. The restricted stock units granted by the Company from the beginning of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 generally vest in

two

equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the recipient remaining employed by the Company as of the applicable vesting date.

The following table shows the weighted-average grant date fair value per unit for the restricted stock units granted and tax benefits realized by the Company in connection with vested and released restricted stock units for the indicated periods:

As of

June 30, 2015

, the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense balance related to restricted stock units was

$60.3 million

, excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures, and will be recognized over a weighted-average remaining contractual term and an estimated weighted-average amortization period of

1.0 year

. The intrinsic value of outstanding restricted stock units as of

June 30, 2015

was

$150.3 million

.

Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation

Starting in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, the Company adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) program for many of its employees as part of the Company’s employee compensation program. During the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, the Company approved Cash LTI awards of

$67.7 million

under the Company’s Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”). Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash LTI Plan will vest in

four

equal installments, with

25%

of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a

four

-year period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by the Company as of the applicable award vesting date. Executives and non-employee Board members are not participating in this program. During the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

and


, the Company recognized

$39.6 million

and

$26.2 million

, respectively, in compensation expense under the Cash LTI Plan. As of

June 30, 2015

, the unrecognized compensation balance (excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures) related to the Cash LTI Plan was

$94.5 million

.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

KLA-Tencor’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) provides that eligible employees may contribute up to

10%

of their eligible earnings toward the semi-annual purchase of KLA-Tencor’s common stock. The ESPP is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The employee’s purchase price is derived from a formula based on the closing price  of the common stock on the first day of the offering period versus the closing price on the date of purchase (or, if not a trading day, on the immediately preceding trading day).

The offering period (or length of the look-back period) under the ESPP has a duration of

six months

, and the purchase price with respect to each offering period beginning on or after such date is, until otherwise amended, equal to

85%

of the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the commencement of the applicable six-month offering period or (ii) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the purchase date. The Company estimates the fair value of purchase rights under the ESPP using a Black-Scholes valuation model.



The fair value of each purchase right under the ESPP was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the straight-line attribution approach with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The following table shows total cash received from employees for the issuance of shares under the ESPP, the number of shares purchased by employees through the ESPP, the tax benefits realized by the Company in connection with the disqualifying dispositions of shares purchased under the ESPP and the weighted-average fair value per share for the indicated periods:

The ESPP shares are replenished annually on the first day of each fiscal year by virtue of an evergreen provision. The provision allows for share replenishment equal to the lesser of

2.0 million

shares or the number of shares which KLA-Tencor estimates will be required to be issued under the ESPP during the forthcoming fiscal year. In August 2014, the Company added

2.0 million

additional shares to the ESPP pursuant to the plan’s share replenishment provision with respect to the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

. As of

June 30, 2015

, a total of

2.1 million

shares were reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP.

Quarterly cash dividends

On May 7, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of

$0.50

per share on the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, which was paid on June 1, 2015 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 18, 2015. Under the authoritative guidance, a dividend when declared is recognized as a reduction of retained earnings, to the extent available, with any excess recognized as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital. The total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid by the Company during the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

and


was

$324.8 million

and

$298.9 million

, respectively. The amount of accrued dividends for quarterly cash dividends for unvested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights was

$0.9 million

as of

June 30, 2015

. The Company had

no

accrued dividends for the quarterly cash dividends in the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

.

On

July 14, 2015

, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a further increase in the level of the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from

$0.50

to

$0.52

per share. Refer to Note 19, “Subsequent Events” for additional information on dividend increase announced subsequent to June 30, 2015.



Special cash dividend

On November 19, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of

$16.50

per share, which was paid on December 9, 2014 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2014. Additionally, in connection with the special cash dividend, the Company’s Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a proportionate and equitable adjustment to outstanding equity awards (restricted stock units and stock options), as required under the 2004 Plan, subject to the vesting requirements of the underlying awards. As the adjustment was required by the 2004 Plan, the adjustment to the outstanding awards did not result in any incremental compensation expense due to modification of such awards, under the authoritative guidance. Under the authoritative guidance, the dividend when declared is recognized as a reduction of retained earnings, to the extent available, with any excess recognized as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital. The special cash dividend reduced the retained earnings by

$2.1 billion

as of the special cash dividend declaration date, reducing the retained earnings amount to

zero

and the excess amount of the special cash dividend of

$646.5 million

was charged against additional paid-in capital. The declaration and payment of the special cash dividend are part of the Company’s leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in Note 7, “Debt” that was completed during the three months ended

December 31, 2014

. The total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by the Company during the

three

months ended

December 31, 2014

was approximately

$2.76 billion

, substantially all of which was paid out during the

three

months ended

December 31, 2014

. As of

June 30, 2015

, the Company accrued a total of

$41.1 million

of dividends payable for the special cash dividend with respect to outstanding unvested restricted stock units, which will be paid when such underlying unvested restricted stock units vest. Other than the special cash dividend declared during the

three

months ended

December 31, 2014

, the Company historically has not declared any special cash dividends.

NOTE 9 — STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized a program for the Company to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The intent of this program is to offset the dilution from KLA-Tencor’s equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan, as well as to return excess cash to the Company’s stockholders. Subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market in compliance with applicable securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder such as Rule 10b-18. On

July 7, 2014

, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized KLA-Tencor to repurchase up to

13.0 million

additional shares of the Company’s common stock. On

October 23, 2014

, as part of the leveraged recapitalization transaction announcement, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the existing stock repurchase program of

3.6 million

additional shares of the Company’s common stock. As of

June 30, 2015

, an aggregate of approximately

9.4 million

shares were available for repurchase under the Company’s repurchase program.

Share repurchases for the indicated periods (based on the trade date of the applicable repurchase) were as follows:

As of

June 30, 2015

, the Company had repurchased

105,542

shares for

$6.0 million

, which repurchases had not settled prior to

June 30, 2015

and were recorded as a component of other current liabilities.



NOTE 10 — NET INCOME PER SHARE

Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is calculated by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the shares of common stock underlying the Company’s outstanding dilutive stock options and restricted stock units had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that is to be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:

NOTE 11 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

KLA-Tencor has a profit sharing program for eligible employees, which distributes, on a quarterly basis, a percentage of the Company’s pre-tax profits. In addition, the Company has an employee savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Since April 1, 2011, the employer match amount was

50%

of the first

$8,000

of an eligible employee’s contribution (i.e., a maximum of

$4,000

) during each fiscal year.

The total expenses under the profit sharing and 401(k) programs aggregated

$14.2 million

,

$15.4 million

and

$13.1 million

in the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


, respectively. The Company has no defined benefit plans in the United States. In addition to the profit sharing plan and the United States 401(k), several of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have retirement plans for their full-time employees, several of which are defined benefit plans. Consistent with the requirements of local law, the Company deposits funds for certain of these plans with insurance companies, with third-party trustees or into government-managed accounts and/or accrues for the unfunded portion of the obligation. The assumptions used in calculating the obligation for the foreign plans depend on the local economic environment.

The Company applies authoritative guidance that requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined pension and post-retirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on its balance sheets. Additionally, the authoritative guidance requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position. The benefit obligations and related assets under the Company’s plans have been measured as of June 30,


and


.



Summary data relating to the Company’s foreign defined benefit pension plans, including key weighted-average assumptions used, is provided in the following tables:

The assumptions for expected rate of return on assets were developed by considering the historical returns and expectations of future returns relevant to the country in which each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the corresponding plan. The discount rate for each plan was derived by reference to appropriate benchmark yields on high quality corporate bonds, allowing for the approximate duration of both plan obligations and the relevant benchmark index.



The following table presents losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) before tax related to the Company’s foreign defined benefit pension plans:

Losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the Company’s foreign defined benefit pension plans expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the fiscal year ending

June 30, 2016

are as follows:

The components of the Company’s net periodic cost relating to its foreign subsidiaries’ defined pension plans are as follows:

Fair Value of Plan Assets

Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value of plan assets are described in Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements.”

The foreign plans’ investments are managed by third-party trustees consistent with the regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The Company is not actively involved in the investment strategy, nor does it have control over the target allocation of these investments. These investments made up

100%

of total foreign plan assets in the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

and


.

The expected aggregate employer contribution for the foreign plans during the fiscal year ending

June 30, 2016

is

$1.7 million

.

The total benefits to be paid from the foreign pension plans are not expected to exceed

$2.5 million

in any year through the fiscal year ending June 30,


.



Foreign plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following investment categories as of

June 30, 2015

and


, respectively:

Concentration of Risk

The Company manages a variety of risks, including market, credit and liquidity risks, across its plan assets through its investment managers. The Company defines a concentration of risk as an undiversified exposure to one of the above-mentioned risks that increases the exposure of the loss of plan assets unnecessarily. The Company monitors exposure to such risks in the foreign plans by monitoring the magnitude of the risk in each plan and diversifying the Company’s exposure to such risks across a variety of instruments, markets and counterparties. As of June 30,


, the Company did not have concentrations of plan asset investment risk in any single entity, manager, counterparty, sector, industry or country.

NOTE 12 — INCOME TAXES

The components of income before income taxes are as follows:

The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:

For the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, actual current tax liabilities were lower than reflected in the table above by

$16.7 million

primarily due to a benefit for a deduction related to employee stock activity, which was recorded as an increase to capital in excess of par value.



For the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2014

, actual current tax liabilities were lower than reflected in the table above by

$16.5 million

primarily due to a benefit for a deduction related to employee stock activity, which was recorded as an increase to capital in excess of par value.

For the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2013

, actual current tax liabilities were lower than reflected in the table above by

$6.9 million

primarily due to a benefit for a deduction related to employee stock activity, which was recorded as an increase to capital in excess of par value.

The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

As of

June 30, 2015

, the Company had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss (“NOL”) carry-forwards of approximately

$25.7 million

,

$90.8 million

and

$50.2 million

, respectively. The U.S. federal NOL carry-forwards will expire at various dates beginning in

2023 through 2027

. The utilization of NOLs created by acquired companies is subject to annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, it is not expected that such annual limitation will significantly impair the realization of these NOLs. The state NOLs will begin to expire in


. State credits of

$123.7 million

will be carried over indefinitely. The foreign NOL carry-forwards will begin to expire in


.

The net deferred tax asset valuation allowance was

$91.4 million

and

$76.3 million

as of June 30,


and June 30,


, respectively. The change was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance related to state credit carry-forwards generated in the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

. The valuation allowance is based on the Company’s assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Of the valuation allowance as of June 30,


,

$76.9 million

relates to state credit carry-forwards. The remainder of the valuation allowance relates primarily to foreign NOL carry-forwards.

As of

June 30, 2015

, U.S. income taxes were not provided for on a cumulative total of approximately

$1.7 billion

of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, they would generate foreign tax credits to reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend. Assuming full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with undistributed earnings would be approximately

$573.9 million

.



KLA-Tencor benefits from tax holidays in Israel and Singapore where it manufactures certain of its products. These tax holidays are on approved investments and are scheduled to expire at varying times. One tax holiday expired this year and the remaining tax holidays will expire beginning in

2019 through 2021

. The impact on the tax holiday that expired this year was approximately

$3.1 million

in tax savings for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

. The Company was in compliance with all the terms and conditions of the tax holidays as of

June 30, 2015

. The net impact of these tax holidays was to decrease the Company’s tax expense by approximately

$20.4 million

,

$25.8 million

and

$25.8 million

in the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


, respectively. The benefits of the tax holidays on diluted net income per share were

$0.13

,

$0.15

and

$0.15

for the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


, respectively.

The reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to KLA-Tencor’s effective income tax rate is as follows:

A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate was

$69.0 million

,

$59.6 million

and

$59.5 million

as of June 30,


,


and


respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was

$1.2 million

,

$0.7 million

, and

$1.4 million

, respectively. KLA-Tencor’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within other expense (income), net. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of June 30,


and


was approximately

$7.9 million

and

$6.7 million

, respectively.

The Company is subject to federal income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 and is under United States federal income tax examination for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The Company is subject to state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The Company is also subject to examinations in other major foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore, for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from any future examinations of these years.

It is possible that certain examinations may be concluded in the next twelve months. The Company believes it is possible that it may recognize up to

$27.3 million

of its existing unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of the lapse of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations with various tax authorities.



NOTE 13 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Factoring.

KLA-Tencor has agreements (referred to as “factoring agreements”) with financial institutions to sell certain of its trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. The Company does not believe it is at risk for any material losses as a result of these agreements. In addition, the Company periodically sells certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods.

The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods:

Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.

Facilities.

KLA-Tencor leases certain of its facilities under arrangements that are accounted for as operating leases. Rent expense was

$9.1 million

,

$8.7 million

and

$9.2 million

for the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

,


and


, respectively.

The following is a schedule of expected operating lease payments:

Purchase Commitments.

KLA-Tencor maintains commitments to purchase inventory from its suppliers as well as goods and services in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. The Company’s estimate of its significant purchase commitments is approximately

$298.7 million

as of June 30,


which are primarily due within the next


months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.

Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan.

As of

June 30, 2015

, the Company had committed

$125.0 million

to future payment obligations under its Cash LTI Plan. The calculation of compensation expense related to the Cash LTI Plan includes estimated forfeiture rate assumptions. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash LTI Plan vest in

four

equal installments, with

25%

of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a

four

-year period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by the Company as of the applicable award vesting date.

Warranties, Guarantees and Contingencies.

KLA-Tencor provides standard warranty coverage on its systems for


hours per week for


months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. The Company accounts for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, the Company calculates the average service hours and parts expense per system and applies the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. The Company updates these estimated charges on a regular basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases the Company adjusts its warranty accruals accordingly.



The following table provides the changes in the product warranty accrual for the indicated periods:

The Company maintains guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to

$22.5 million

, of which

$19.0 million

had been issued as of

June 30, 2015

, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of the Company’s subsidiaries in Europe and Asia.

KLA-Tencor is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provides customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by the Company’s products, non-compliance with the Company’s product performance specifications, infringement by the Company’s products of third-party intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by the Company is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with the Company pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.

This usually allows the Company to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at the Company’s option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by the Company.

Subject to certain limitations, the Company is obligated to indemnify its current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to the Company. These obligations arise under the terms of the Company’s certificate of incorporation, its bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that the Company is required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters.

In addition, the Company may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, response time and other commitments. Furthermore, the Company may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that the Company is complying with these commitments. If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, the Company may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. To date, the Company has made no significant accruals in its consolidated financial statements for this contingency. While the Company has not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, the Company cannot make any assurance that it will not incur any such liabilities in the future.

It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements have not had a material effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



NOTE 14 — LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL MATTERS

The Company is named from time to time as a party to lawsuits and other types of legal proceedings and claims in the normal course of its business. Actions filed against the Company include commercial, intellectual property, customer, and labor and employment related claims, including complaints of alleged wrongful termination and potential class action lawsuits regarding alleged violations of federal and state wage and hour and other laws. In general, legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their merit, and associated internal investigations (especially those relating to intellectual property or confidential information disputes) are often expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct and may divert management’s attention and other company resources. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of outcome. The Company believes the amounts provided in its consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimated liabilities. However, because such matters are subject to many uncertainties, the ultimate outcomes are not predictable, and there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from the matters described above will not exceed the amounts reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements or will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

NOTE 15 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

The Company has in recent years undertaken a number of cost reduction activities, including workforce reductions, in an effort to lower its ongoing expense run rate. The program in the United States is accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance related to compensation for non-retirement post-employment benefits, whereas the programs in the Company’s international locations are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for contingencies.

In April 2015, we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirement in our industry. The goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a

$31.6 million

net restructuring charge, of which

$8.0 million

was recorded to costs of revenues,

$11.1 million

to engineering, research and development expense and

$12.5 million

to selling, general and administrative expense. Net restructuring charge amounting to

$22.4 million

was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, substantial majority of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan.

The following table shows the activity primarily related to accrual for severance and benefits for the fiscal years ended

June 30, 2015

and


:

The accrual for severance and benefits as of June 30, 2015 is expected to be paid out by the end of our fiscal quarter ending December 31,


.

The Company expects to incur additional charges, including additional severance costs and other related costs, in connection with the completion of its global workforce reduction during the first two quarters of fiscal year 2016

.



NOTE 16 — DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The authoritative guidance requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency exchange contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of any hedges, are recognized in other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations. In accordance with the guidance, the Company designates foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and purchase transactions.

KLA-Tencor’s foreign subsidiaries operate and sell KLA-Tencor’s products in various global markets. As a result, KLA-Tencor is exposed to risks relating to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. KLA-Tencor utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain existing and forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and purchase transactions, such as the Japanese yen, the euro, the New Taiwan dollar and the Israeli new shekel. The Company routinely hedges its exposures to certain foreign currencies with various financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations. These currency forward exchange contracts and options, designated as cash flow hedges, generally have maturities of less than

18 months

. Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness monthly, based on changes in total fair value of the derivatives. If a financial counterparty to any of the Company’s hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, the Company may experience material losses.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of currency forward exchange and option contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

For derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other expense (income), net. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. The gains and losses on these derivatives are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

In October 2014, in anticipation of the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of forward contracts (“Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the Senior Notes. The objective of the Rate Lock Agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing, on the notional amount being hedged. The Rate Lock Agreements had a notional amount of

$1 billion

in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

. The Company designated each of the Rate Lock Agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge, under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the close out of the Rate Lock Agreements was initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a reduction of total stockholders’ equity and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. The ineffective portion, if any, was recognized in earnings immediately. The Rate Lock Agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the

$1.25 billion

of

4.650%

Senior Notes due in 2024 and the Company recorded the fair value of a

$7.5 million

receivable as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of

December 31, 2014

. For the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, the Company recognized

$0.5 million

for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which amount reduced the interest expense. The Company did not record any ineffectiveness for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

. The cash proceeds of

$7.5 million

from the settlement of the Rate Lock Agreements were included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

because the designated hedged item was classified as interest expense in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

In addition, in November 2014, the Company entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate used to determine the redemption amount of the 2018 Senior Notes that occurred during the three months ended

December 31, 2014

. The objective of the forward contract was to hedge the risk associated with the variability of the redemption amount due to changes in interest rates through the redemption of the existing 2018 Senior Notes. The forward contract had a notional amount of

$750 million

. The forward contract was terminated in December 2014 and the resulting fair value of

$1.2 million

receivable was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net line in the consolidated statements of operations, partially offsetting the loss on redemption of the debt during the three months

December 31, 2014

. The cash proceeds from the forward contract were included in the cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 2015

, partially offsetting the cash outflows for the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes.

NOTE 17 — SEGMENT REPORTING AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

KLA-Tencor reports

one

reportable segment in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative guidance for segment reporting. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. KLA-Tencor’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer.

The Company is engaged primarily in designing, manufacturing and marketing process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. All operating segments have been aggregated due to their inter-dependencies, commonality of long-term economic characteristics, products and services, the production processes, class of customer and distribution processes. The Company’s service products are an extension of the system product portfolio and provide customers with spare parts and fab management services (including system preventive maintenance and optimization services) to improve yield, increase production uptime and throughput, and lower the cost of ownership. Since the Company operates in one reportable segment, all financial segment information required by the authoritative guidance can be found in the consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s significant operations outside the United States include manufacturing facilities in Singapore, Israel, Germany and China and sales, marketing and service offices in Western Europe, Japan and the Asia Pacific regions. For geographical revenue reporting, revenues are attributed to the geographic location in which the customer is located. Long-lived assets consist of land, property and equipment, net and are attributed to the geographic region in which they are located.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of KLA-Tencor Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of KLA-Tencor Corporation and its subsidiaries at

June 30, 2015

and

June 30, 2014

, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

June 30, 2015

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

June 30, 2015

based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM  9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) (“Disclosure Controls”) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Report”) required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b). The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report the Company’s Disclosure Controls were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Attached as exhibits to this Report are certifications of the CEO and CFO, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This Controls and Procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

Definition of Disclosure Controls

Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company’s Disclosure Controls include components of its internal control over financial reporting, which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. To the extent that components of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting are included within its Disclosure Controls, they are included in the scope of the Company’s annual controls evaluation.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

June 30, 2015

.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

June 30, 2015

has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company’s Disclosure Controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year


that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
