                                     PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

The Company

         KLA-Tencor  Corporation  ("KLA-Tencor") is the world's leading supplier
of process  control and yield  management  solutions for the  semiconductor  and
related  microelectronics  industries.  Our comprehensive portfolio of products,
software,  analysis,  services  and  expertise  is designed  to help  integrated

circuit  manufacturers  manage yield  throughout  the entire  wafer  fabrication
process--from research and development to final mass production yield analysis.

         We offer a broad  spectrum of products  and  services  that are used by
every major semiconductor  manufacturer in the world. These customers turn to us
for in-line wafer defect  monitoring;  reticle and photomask defect  inspection;
critical  dimension  scanning  electron  microscope ("CD SEM") metrology;  wafer
overlay;  film and surface  measurement;  and overall  yield and  fab-wide  data
analysis.  These  advanced  products,  coupled with our unique yield  technology
services,  allow us to deliver  the  complete  yield  management  solutions  our
customers  need to accelerate  their yield  learning  rates,  reduce their yield
excursion risks and adopt industry-leading yield management practices.

         KLA-Tencor  was  formed  in  April  1997  through  the  merger  of  KLA
Instruments and Tencor  Instruments,  two long-time leaders in the semiconductor
equipment  industry,  each with  over 20 years of  experience.  KLA  Instruments
Corporation was  incorporated in Delaware in July 1975;  Tencor  Instruments was
incorporated in California in 1976. Effective April 30, 1997, Tencor Instruments
merged  into  a  wholly  owned   subsidiary  of  KLA  Instruments   Corporation.
Immediately   following  this  merger,  KLA  Instruments  changed  its  name  to
KLA-Tencor.

Industry

General Background

         The  semiconductor  fabrication  process  begins  with a  bare  silicon
wafer--a  round disk that is six,  eight or twelve inches in diameter,  about as
thick as a credit card and gray in color. The process of manufacturing wafers is
in itself  highly  sophisticated,  involving  the  creation  of large  ingots of
silicon  by  pulling  them out of a vat of molten  silicon.  The ingots are then
sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror  finish on one  surface,  upon which
the circuits are made.

         The   fabrication  of  an  integrated   circuit  ("IC"  or  "chip")  is
accomplished by depositing a series of film layers upon a silicon wafer that act
as conductors, semiconductors or insulators. The deposition of these film layers
is interspersed  with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns,
remove  portions of the film layers,  and perform other  functions  such as heat
treatment,  measurement and inspection.  Most advanced chip designs require over
300 individual  steps,  many of which are performed  multiple times.  Most chips
consist of two main  structures:  the lower structure,  typically  consisting of
transistors or capacitors, which performs the "smart" functions of the chip; and
the upper structure,  typically  consisting of "interconnect"  circuitry,  which
connects the components in the lower structure.

Current Trends

         Companies  that  anticipate  future market  demands by  developing  and
refining new technologies and manufacturing  processes, as well as bringing them
into  production,  are better  positioned to lead in the  semiconductor  market.
During previous industry cycles,  semiconductor  manufacturers  generally had to
contend with one key new technology or market trend,  such as a specific  design

rule shrink.  In today's market,  the leading  semiconductor  manufacturers  are
investing in bringing  three key new  technologies  into  production at the same
time: copper interconnects;  deep-sub-wavelength lithography (0.13-micron design
rules and below);  and 300 mm (the next larger wafer size,  from which more than
twice as many ICs can be produced as on 200 mm wafers).

         While  each  of  these  three  technologies  has  been  adopted  at the
development and pilot  production  stages,  several  significant  challenges and
risks  associated  with each one have slowed  their  adoption  into  full-volume
production.  For example, as design rules decrease, yields become more sensitive
to the size and density of defects,  while  device  performance  characteristics
become  more  sensitive  to such  parameters  as  linewidth  and  film-thickness
variation,  among other factors.  Copper introduces both new defects,  which are
harder to find within the interconnect structure, as well as electrical defects,
which cannot be detected using conventional  optical inspection systems.  300 mm
wafers are more  susceptible to damage than 200 mm wafers since they can bend or
bow twice as much,  creating  stress on the wafer that can result in yield loss.
Film  uniformity  is also more  difficult  to maintain on these  larger  wafers.
Moving all three of these  advanced  technologies  into  production at once only
adds to the risk that chipmakers  face,  since technical  challenges in bringing
any one of these into production  could also be a factor in slowing the adoption
of the other two.

         Our key activities  during fiscal year 2002 involved the development of
new  process  control  and yield  management  tools that  enable  chipmakers  to
accelerate the adoption of these new technologies  into full-volume  production,
while   minimizing   their   associated    risks.    With   our   portfolio   of
application-focused  technologies and our dedicated yield technology  expertise,
we are in a unique  position  to be the single  source for  comprehensive  yield
management  solutions  that  enable our  customers  to  achieve  first-to-market
success for their next-generation products.

         The continuing evolution of semiconductor  devices to smaller linewidth
geometries and more complex  multi-level  circuitry has significantly  increased
the  cost  and  performance  requirements  of  the  capital  equipment  used  to
manufacture  these  devices.  Construction  of  an  advanced  wafer  fabrication
facility  can cost over $2  billion,  a  substantial  increase  over the cost of
previous-generation  facilities. As a result, chipmakers are demanding increased
productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment.  Because our
process control and yield management equipment typically represents only a small
percentage of the total investment required to build a fabrication facility, our
customers are able to better leverage these  increasingly  expensive  facilities
and significantly improve their return on investment ("ROI").

Our Process Control and Yield Acceleration Solutions

         Accelerating  the yield ramp and maximizing  the  production  yields of
high-performance  devices are key goals of modern  semiconductor  manufacturing.
Achieving higher yields faster,  along with higher performance  characteristics,
increases the revenue a manufacturer can obtain from each  semiconductor  wafer.
KLA-Tencor's  systems are used to analyze  product  and  process  quality at all
critical  points in the IC  manufacturing  process and  provide  feedback to our
customers  so  that  fabrication  problems  can  be  identified,  addressed  and
eliminated.  This  ability to locate the  source of  defects  and other  process
issues, as well as contain them, enables semiconductor  manufacturers to improve

control over their manufacturing processes, as well as increase their yields and
device value--thus maximizing the return on their investments and lowering their
manufacturing costs.

         The  following  are some of the methods used to  accelerate  yields and
optimize  device  performance,  all of which require the capture and analysis of
data gathered through many measurements:

                  Engineering  analysis:  This method of  analysis is  performed
         off-line from the manufacturing process to identify, analyze and locate
         the  source  of  defects  or  other   manufacturing   process   issues.
         Engineering  analysis  equipment operates with very high sensitivity to
         enable comprehensive  analysis of wafers.  Because this method operates
         off the manufacturing line, high operational speeds are not required.

                  In-line monitoring:  This method of analysis is used to review
         the status of ICs during production.  Information  generated is used to
         determine  whether the  fabrication  process steps are within  required
         tolerances.  It is also used to make any  necessary  real-time  process
         adjustments  before  wafer lots move to  subsequent  process  stations.
         Because  information  related  to defects  is needed  quickly,  in-line
         monitoring requires both high throughput and high sensitivity.

                  Pass/fail  tests:  This  method  of  analysis  may be  used at
         several  different  points in the  manufacturing  process  to  evaluate
         whether products meet performance specifications.

         The most  significant  opportunities  for yield and device  performance
improvement generally occur when production is started at new factories and when
chips or wafers are first built.  Equipment  that helps a  manufacturer  quickly
increase  new  product  yields  and  optimize  device  performance  enables  the
manufacturer  to offer these new products in high  volumes  early in the product
life cycle--the time when they are likely to generate the greatest profits.

         KLA-Tencor  is the leader in the  design,  manufacture,  marketing  and
service of process monitoring and yield management systems for the semiconductor
industry.  Our technical expertise and understanding of customer needs enable us
to provide  unique yield  management  solutions and one of the broadest lines of
process  monitoring  and yield  management  function  systems  available  in the
semiconductor  industry.  Our  systems  are used to analyze  product and process
quality at critical points in the IC manufacturing  process,  as well as provide
feedback to our  customers  that can be used to identify,  address,  contain and
eliminate fabrication problems.

Products

         We  market  and  sell  products  to  all  major  semiconductor,  wafer,
photomask   and  data   storage   manufacturers   worldwide.   We  combine   our
hardware--consisting  of patterned and  unpatterned  wafer  inspection,  optical
overlay   metrology,   e-beam   review,   reticle  and   photomask   inspection,
spectroscopic-  and  SEM-based CD  metrology,  and film and surface  measurement
tools--with our advanced yield analysis and defect classification software, into
fab-wide  yield  management  solutions  that  are  optimized  for  each  of  the

manufacturing process cells used in IC production,  including lithography, etch,
deposition and chemical mechanical  planarization  ("CMP").  Our products can be
broadly  categorized  into five  groups:  Defect  Inspection,  Metrology,  Yield
Management Software Solutions, Customer Service and Support, and Data Storage.

Defect Inspection

         Our defect  inspection  tools are used to detect,  count,  classify and
characterize particles and pattern defects in off-line engineering applications,
as well as in-line at various stages during the wafer, semiconductor and reticle
manufacturing processes. We pioneered the market for automated defect inspection
of  semiconductor  wafers and reticles  more than two decades ago. Our portfolio
includes all the tools  necessary  for our  customers to detect,  correlate  and
analyze defects, as well as determine and correct their cause.

         High-Resolution Imaging Inspection

                  Our 2xxx wafer  inspection  series,  first introduced in 1992,
         has set the standard for  high-sensitivity  patterned wafer  inspection
         through  a  unique  combination  of  high-speed  image  processing,  an
         ultra-broadband  brightfield illumination source and our Segmented Auto
         Threshold   technology.   In  2000,  we  unveiled  our  next-generation
         platform,  the 2350, which was the first ultraviolet  ("UV") inspection
         system to feature ultra-broadband brightfield illumination.  Delivering
         a two-fold  increase in throughput  over the previous  generation  2xxx
         platform,  the 2350  enables the  resolution  of circuit  patterns  and
         defects for  0.13-micron  and smaller  processes.  In July of 2001,  an
         upgrade to the 2350 was introduced, the 2351, which offers enhancements
         in sensitivity, throughput and ease of use.

         High-Speed Laser Scattering Inspection

                  Our  AIT  wafer   inspection   family  is  designed  for  high
         throughput  and low  cost of  ownership  ("CoO"),  providing  fast  and
         accurate feedback on process tool performance, as well as advanced line
         monitoring for films, CMP, and non-critical etch and photo modules. The
         AIT  series  uses  patented  double-darkfield  technology,  which  is a
         low-angle  illumination  technique particularly effective for detecting
         defects on planar surfaces such as post-CMP wafers. First introduced in
         1995,  the AIT platform has been  continually  enhanced  over the years
         with  increasing  levels of  sensitivity  and throughput to address the
         inspection needs for 0.13-micron and smaller design rules.

                  In June  2001,  we  unveiled  the AIT XP,  which  took our AIT
         inspection family to a whole new level of performance. With its ability
         to dynamically  adjust and optimize  inspection  speed and sensitivity,
         while  filtering  out  nuisance  defects,  the AIT XP delivers  maximum
         sensitivity to all die regions in a single pass. The system can scan an
         entire wafer in as little as 80 seconds with the sensitivity  needed to
         inspect advanced devices incorporating 0.10-micron (100-nm) and smaller
         design rules.

         E-Beam Inspection

                  SEMs  use an  electron  beam  to  image  and  measure  surface
         features  on a  semiconductor  wafer at a much higher  resolution  than
         images  captured by optical  microscopes.  As the industry moves deeper
         into the  sub-0.15-micron  copper  device realm,  SEM-based  inspection
         becomes mandatory for accelerating  yield ramps.  KLA-Tencor  pioneered
         this  market  with the  introduction  of the  industry's  first  e-beam
         inspection  system  nearly 10 years ago. In 1999, we unveiled the eS20,
         the first scanning e-beam wafer inspection  system optimized for use in
         full-volume  production.  The following year, we introduced the eS20XP,
         which delivers  further  improvements in sensitivity  while  increasing
         throughput to enable true production line monitoring of sub-0.13-micron
         semiconductor manufacturing. KLA-Tencor leveraged more than 25 years of
         experience in wafer inspection to bring this latest tool to market.

         Optical and E-beam Defect Review

                  Our defect review  capability  includes  optical  confocal and
         e-beam scanning technology.  In 1995, we introduced the CRS(TM) optical
         review   system,   which   enables   high-speed   defect   review   and
         classification  on both  patterned  and  unpatterned  200 mm and 300 mm
         wafers at a low CoO. In 2000,  we  introduced  the eV300 defect  review
         system--an  advanced,  automated  SEM  designed  to gather and  analyze
         defect  excursion  information,  as well as report the results with the
         improved  sensitivity required at 0.13-micron and smaller design rules.
         The  eV300  supplements  optical  review  by  providing   topographical
         information,  enabling more accurate defect  classification than can be
         achieved by optical review systems alone.

         In-line Non Contact Electrical Defect Monitoring

                  The increasing  complexity of IC manufacturing  has given rise
         to a greater  number of electrical  defects,  causing  device  failure.
         Accelerating   yield   learning  for  the   back-end-of-line   process,
         especially  in the  development  and early  ramp  phases,  is made more
         difficult by the task of isolating these yield-killing defects from the
         thousands of  non-relevant  defects  induced by material  anomalies--an
         extremely  time-consuming process that can take from two to eight weeks
         to complete per yield-learning cycle.

                  Our breakthrough uLoop(TM) methodology,  introduced in October
         2001,  provides a fab-wide  framework of solutions that accelerate time
         to yield  through an  aggressive  merger of  inspection,  metrology and
         electrical  test data.  eDo,  the first  product  in the uLoop  family,
         combines  non-contact  electrical  test with  in-line  physical  defect
         inspection to produce the fastest root-cause  analysis method available
         in the industry today.  Using eDo,  chipmakers can reduce the length of
         their yield-learning  cycles down to only a few days. This new approach
         represents an integrated turnkey solution to electrical inspection that
         increases  the  speed  and  effectiveness  of  root-cause  analysis  by
         detecting and imaging electrical defects quickly,  while minimizing the
         engineering  resources required to gather and assimilate the root-cause

         data. eDo comprises:  proprietary test structures;  KLA-Tencor's eS20XP
         e-beam  inspection  system;  and the  uLoop  Controller--an  integrated
         defect  characterization,  analysis,  and  reporting  system.  The test
         structures  are  designed to meet the  customer's  design rule and chip
         size  requirements.  Optimized for  voltage-contrast  inspection  using
         KLA-Tencor's  e-beam  technology,  the test  structures  enable  highly
         accurate and accelerated electrical defect capture.

         Unpatterned Wafer Inspection

                  In 1997,  we  introduced  the Surfscan  SP1(TM) for bare wafer
         qualification,    process    monitoring   and   equipment    monitoring
         applications. It provides the high sensitivity, fast throughput and low
         CoO required in a production environment,  and is used in virtually all
         semiconductor   manufacturing   processes.  The  SP1TBI  ("Triple  Beam
         Illumination") was introduced in 1998, and was designed with additional
         optical  configurations  needed to detect  sub-micron  defects on metal
         films and rough surfaces while still providing sensitivity below 100 nm
         on polished  silicon.  The SP1TBI is also used for detecting defects on
         non-uniform  films, a critical  requirement  for CMP  applications.  In
         1999, we introduced a surface nanotopography measurement capability for
         the SP1  that  enhances  lithography  and CMP  process  monitoring  for
         0.13-micron process  development.  In 2001, we unveiled the SP1DLS, the
         first 300 mm tool to provide brightfield,  darkfield and nanotopography
         defect  information in a single scan. It has the sensitivity to capture
         the widest  variety  of  defects  as small as 50 nm at high  throughput
         speeds of up to 125 wafers per hour.

         Macro After-Develop Inspection

                  In  1999,  we  became  the  first  to  automate  after-develop
         inspection  ("ADI") for macro defects with the introduction of the 2401
         macro defect inspection system.  Designed to replace inefficient manual
         macro ADI, the 2401 is the industry's first fully automated  inspection
         system  able  to  detect  and  classify  front-end  macro  lithographic
         defects,  which are 50 microns  and larger in size.  Manual ADI methods
         may  capture  only 20 percent of  photo-related  defects as a result of
         wafer complexity,  background  patterning noise, and human fatigue.  In
         contrast,  the 2401 captures more than 90 percent of all critical macro
         ADI defects,  while providing  comprehensive defect  classification and
         yield  information to dramatically  reduce scrap and enable  continuous
         process improvements.

                  In 2001,  we  introduced  the 2430  macro  ADI  series,  which
         brought the benefits of the 2401's advanced analysis capabilities, high
         throughput  and advanced  detection  algorithms  to 300 mm  production.
         Macro defects,  which can ruin the entire wafer, are especially  costly
         to chipmakers in 300 mm production, since more than twice the number of
         die are at risk with these larger  wafers as compared to 200 mm wafers.
         The 2430 is the first  automated  macro ADI  system on the market to be
         fully compliant with I300I standards for complete integration and rapid
         deployment in 300 mm fabs.

         Backside Wafer Inspection

                  In 2002, we unveiled a new Backside Inspection Module ("BSIM")
         option for the Surfscan SP1 series that provides the  industry's  first
         fully automated,  non-destructive inspection solution for the backsides
         of  patterned  production  wafers.  Wafer  backside  defects can have a
         significant impact on wafer and process  uniformity,  both of which are
         critical  issues  in  advanced  300 mm  processing.  Our  field  trials
         indicate that these backside  defects can arise at nearly every process
         step,  and account for as much as 10 percent of a fab's  baseline yield
         loss--amounting  to millions of dollars  annually in lost revenue.  The
         Surfscan  SP1  with  BSIM  enables  automated,   non-destructive  wafer
         backside  inspection  to be  incorporated  as a routine step into every
         process  module  in  order  to  recover  these  yield  losses  and help
         chipmakers further realize the economic gains in moving to 300 mm.

         Reticle Inspection

                  Our reticle  inspection systems look for possible defects that
         could be transmitted  to the design pattern on the wafer.  Reticles are
         high  precision  quartz  plates  that  contain  microscopic  images  of
         electronic circuits.  Placed into steppers or scanners,  these reticles
         are used to transfer  circuit  patterns  onto wafers to fabricate  ICs.
         Error-free  reticles are the first step in ensuring  high yields in the
         manufacturing  process  since  defects in reticles can be replicated on
         wafers.  Reticle  inspection is becoming  increasingly  critical as the
         industry  moves to deep  sub-wavelength  lithography  (0.13  micron and
         below),  where the feature  sizes  printed on wafers are  significantly
         smaller  than the  wavelength  of light used in the stepper or scanner.
         This  extension of the  lithography  process  results in the mask error
         enhancement  factor,  where reticle  defects once too small to print on
         the  wafer  become  enhanced  in  the  lithography  process  to  create
         yield-killing  wafer  defects.  We pioneered  the market for  automated
         inspection   of  reticles   and   photomasks   for  the   semiconductor
         manufacturing  industry  over two  decades  ago,  and  continue to be a
         market  leader  in  addressing  our  customers'   evolving   inspection
         requirements.

                  Our latest-generation reticle inspection system, TeraStar(TM),
         was  unveiled  in  2000  and has  since  proved  to be one of the  most
         successful  launches  in our  company's  history.  With its  ability to
         inspect up to a  terapixel  (one  million by one  million  pixels)  per
         reticle, TeraStar provides a three-fold increase in throughput compared
         to previous generation systems,  and can detect critical killer defects
         as small as 100 nm--making it ideal for inspecting  advanced  multi-die
         reticles used in high-volume IC production.

Metrology

         Our metrology or process window optimization products provide virtually
all  of  the  critical   measurements   fabs  need  to  manage  their   advanced
manufacturing  processes.  With our unique  combination  of  overlay,  CD,  film
thickness and reflectivity measurements,  IC manufacturers have the capabilities
they need to maintain the tightest possible control of their lithography,  etch,
deposition and CMP processes.

         Optical Overlay

                  Decreasing linewidths, larger die sizes and increasing numbers
         of layers in  semiconductor  devices  all  affect  the  tolerances  for
         layer-to-layer   matching,  or  overlay,  and  can  result  in  overlay
         misregistration  errors--a  crucial  cause  of  yield  loss.  Metrology
         systems are needed to measure the alignment between different layers of
         the semiconductor  device to ensure overlay  parameters are kept within
         specification.

                  KLA-Tencor's  overlay  metrology  systems are more tolerant of
         process  and  substrate  reflectivity  variations  than  other  optical
         systems,  and  provide  the  measurements  that our  customers  need to
         fine-tune their lithography  systems to compensate for these errors and
         improve   process   yield.   In  February   2001,   we   unveiled   our
         latest-generation  overlay  metrology  system,  the  Archer  10,  which
         enables highly precise and accurate  measurements to within 2 nm, while
         providing  one of the  industry's  most  competitive  cost-of-ownership
         overlay tools for sub-0.13 micron and 300 mm production. To augment the
         performance  of the Archer 10, we  introduced a new software  tool this
         past  July  called  Archer  Analyzer  that  conducts  fully  automated,
         real-time,  on-tool overlay metrology analysis.  Seamlessly  integrated
         with  the  Archer  10,  Archer   Analyzer   provides   mission-critical
         information,  such as wafer lot  dispositioning  and stepper correction
         data, which helps  chipmakers  eliminate  unnecessary  wafer rework and
         quickly  address  variations in the  performance  of their  lithography
         tools to minimize  yield loss.  This  results in reduced  cycle  times,
         increased yields and optimum device performance.

         Process Window Monitoring

                  Over time,  optimal  focus and  exposure  settings for a given
         lithography cell and process can drift and change in a variety of ways,
         such as CD variations  during the patterning  process,  which result in
         significant  yield  losses.   Knowing  not  just  the  optimal  process
         settings,  but also the size of the process window and the  sensitivity
         to process variation,  is now critical for stable and efficient pattern
         transfer.

                  KLA-Tencor's  Process Window Monitor(TM)  ("PWM") series of CD
         metrology  systems enables  chipmakers to monitor and match the process
         windows of every  lithography cell and process in the fab in real time.
         Building  upon  the  high  precision,  throughput  and  sensitivity  of
         KLA-Tencor's  CD SEM and optical CD metrology  tools,  the new 8x50-PWM
         and  SpectraCD(TM)-PWM  series of systems  enable a variety of exposure
         tool-based  diagnostics  to  be  off-loaded  to  the  metrology  tools,
         increasing  production capacity and overall equipment  effectiveness of
         lithography  cells.  In addition,  the  focus-exposure  process  window
         information  provided  by  the  PWM  systems  enables  rapid  excursion
         detection and root-cause analysis.

         E-Beam CD Metrology

                  Controlling  CD  linewidth   errors  is  critical  to  the  IC
         manufacturing  process.  Even the tiniest CD variations  can affect the
         speed  of  the  IC,  or  cause  the  device  to  fail  completely.  Our

         latest-generation  wafer CD SEMs,  the 8200  series (for 200 mm wafers)
         and the 8400  series  (for 300 mm  wafers),  combine  high  throughput,
         advanced   imaging,   superior   measurement   precision  and  enhanced
         productivity  capabilities  to enable  tight CD  control  for  critical
         lithography  and  etch  applications.  Our  pQC(TM)  ("Pattern  Quality
         Confirmation")  software  enables  the 8200 and 8400 CD SEMs to provide
         in-line,  real-time  monitoring of feature shape  integrity  during the
         patterning  process--enabling  the  detection of subtle  variations  in
         feature  shape that can occur at and below the 0.13 micron node,  which
         are undetected by traditional CD SEM  measurements.  Our 8250-R reticle
         CD control  system,  which is based on the  8200/8400 CD SEM  platform,
         provides extremely precise and high-throughput measurements on advanced
         reticles used in the production of sub-0.13 micron devices.

         Spectroscopic CD Metrology

                  New materials that are used in advanced IC production, such as
         low-k  dielectrics  and  photoresists  for  193  nm  lithography,   are
         difficult  to  control  during  lithography  and etch  processes.  As a
         result,  they  require  more  comprehensive  data to be taken on device
         features  and  linewidths  in order to  identify  and  correct  process
         variations and remain within process windows.  Our SpectraCD(TM) system
         provides  non-destructive  simultaneous and extensive CD, feature shape
         and  film-thickness  measurements  from a single tool, making it one of
         the industry's lowest cost-of-ownership, production-worthy CD metrology
         systems  for  193-nm  lithography  applications  and  sub-100 nm device
         production.

         Film Measurement

                  Our film measurement products measure a variety of optical and
         electrical properties of thin films. These products are used to control
         a wide  range  of  wafer  fabrication  steps,  where  within-wafer  and
         wafer-to-wafer  uniformity of the process is of paramount importance to
         semiconductor  manufacturers--enabling  them  to  achieve  high  device
         performance characteristics at the lowest possible cost.

                  In 1995, we introduced the UV-1250SE, which brought a powerful
         new technology to production, called spectroscopic ellipsometry ("SE").
         KLA-Tencor  has  shipped  more  than  500  "UV-SE"  systems  since  the
         technology  was first  introduced.  Our third  generation  SE thin-film
         measurement  system tool,  the ASET-F5,  addressed the  difficult  film
         measurement  needs  that came  from the  continuing  evolution  of film
         development  driven by shorter  linewidths.  In 1999,  we introduced an
         enhanced version of the award-winning  ASET-F5,  known as the ASET-F5x.
         It  incorporates  a single  wavelength  ellipsometry  ("SWE") option to
         complement  the  industry-leading  SE and  dual-beam  spectrophotometry
         ("DBS")  technologies  incorporated  in the  ASET-F5  for even  greater
         accuracy, repeatability and system-to-system matching.

                  In June 2002, we unveiled SpectraFx 100, our latest-generation
         thin-film metrology system, which delivers the precision,  matching and
         stability required for advanced film-measurement applications for 90-nm
         device   production,   including   193-nm  deep   ultraviolet   ("DUV")

         lithography  processes.  Designed to fully support  next-generation and
         "operator free" 300 mm fabs with advanced  automation and  tool-to-tool
         matching  capabilities,  SpectraFx  100  enables  foundries  and  other
         multi-product  high-volume  chip  manufacturers  to reduce the  process
         development  time for advanced  materials and accelerate their adoption
         into volume  production.  These materials include 193-nm  photoresists,
         complex  copper  dual-damascene  film  stacks,  and  low-k  and  high-k
         dielectrics.

         Contamination Monitoring

                  Gate   dielectric   quality  is  critical  to  the  speed  and
         reliability of an IC. Below the 0.13-micron node, dielectrics become so
         thin (less than 20 angstroms,  or the equivalent of 0.002 microns) that
         electrical  performance  characteristics of the dielectric films become
         just as critical as physical  characteristics  in  determining  overall
         transistor   performance.   Our   Quantox(TM)   product  line  provides
         non-contact, in-line electrical performance measurements of all the key
         parameters  that  determine  the  quality of advanced  gate  dielectric
         films,  including   contamination  and  oxide  thickness,  as  well  as
         electrical capacitance and leakage.

                  We  introduced  the latest  addition to this  product  family,
         called  Quantox  XP,  earlier  this year.  Quantox XP  provides  highly
         accurate  and  comprehensive  information  on  both  the  physical  and
         electrical  properties  of advanced gate  dielectric  materials in real
         time. These materials  include silicon  oxynitride  ("SiON") and high-k
         dielectrics,  which are required  for  sub-0.13-micron  IC  production.
         Quantox XP data provides  better than 95 percent  correlation to device
         electrical  test  data,   enabling  chipmakers  to  predict  transistor
         performance  in-line,  rather  than  having to wait  until  end-of-line
         electrical  test--a  process  which  normally can take days or weeks to
         complete.

         In-situ CMP End-Point Detection

                  In copper deposition,  metal film thickness and uniformity can
         vary  significantly  from  wafer to  wafer.  To  compensate  for  these
         variances during CMP,  chipmakers have traditionally had to either take
         copper  wafers  off  line,  which  dramatically  slows  the  production
         process,  or have had to use optical-only  in-situ  metrology  methods,
         which provide  limited  information  and unreliable  end-point data. In
         March   2001,   we   unveiled   Precice(TM),   the   industry's   first
         production-worthy  in-situ film thickness and end-point  control system
         for copper CMP that provides highly-accurate measurements in real time.
         Precice   reduces  the  risk  of  process  errors  due  to  non-uniform
         polishing,  thereby  speeding  the  ramp of new  copper  processes  and
         maximizing copper yields.

         Surface Metrology

                  Our Stylus profilers  measure the surface  topography of films
         and etched surfaces,  and are used in basic research and development as
         well as  semiconductor  production  and quality  control.  In 1999,  we
         introduced the HRP-240ETCH,  the latest generation of our award-winning
         HRP(R) high resolution profilers.  This system combines the dishing and
         erosion  measurement  capabilities of our long-scan profilers with high

         aspect  ratio  etched  feature   measurement   capability,   which  has
         historically  been  limited to atomic  force  microscopes.  This allows
         customers to monitor  their  critical  etch  processes  such as shallow
         trench isolation ("STI") and dual-damascene via/trench. We also provide
         stress measurement systems and capabilities,  such as our new wafer bow
         and wafer stress  option for our  ASET-F5x  thin film  metrology  tool,
         which  detects  reliability-related  problems  such as  film  cracking,
         voiding and lifting.

Yield Management Software Solutions

         Our productivity and analysis software systems translate raw inspection
and  metrology  data  into  patterns  that  reveal  process  problems  and  help
semiconductor manufacturers develop long-term yield improvement strategies.

         Yield/Data Analysis and Management

                  In 1999,  we  acquired  Taiwan-based  ACME  Systems,  Inc.,  a
         leading  provider  of  yield   correlation   software.   Combining  the
         newly-acquired  technology  from  ACME  with our own  yield  management
         expertise  led to the  development  of our Klarity  ACE yield  analysis
         software,  which helps our  customers  quickly  identify  the source of
         defects  and  process   problems,   as  well  as  correct  them.  Other
         acquisitions soon followed that continued to enhance our fab-wide yield
         management  portfolio.  With our  acquisition of FINLE  Technologies in
         2000,  we  developed  our Klarity  ProDATA  lithography  data  analysis
         software,  which, along with our  industry-leading  PROLITH lithography
         and etch simulation software, helps manufacturers reduce their advanced
         lithography  development  time and cost.  Also in 2000, we acquired Fab
         Solutions,  which added Automated Process Control ("APC") software into
         our product  portfolio.  APC allows our customers to employ  techniques
         that can automatically compensate for variances in the IC manufacturing
         process, and significantly reduce their yield losses.

                  In 1999, we  introduced  our IMPACT  XP(TM)  automated  defect
         classification ("ADC") software, which provides consistent and accurate
         classification  of   yield-limiting   defects  to  help  our  customers
         accelerate their ramp to higher process yields.  IMPACT XP incorporates
         our   SmartGallery(TM)   setup  tool,  which  reduces  the  setup  time
         associated  with ADC  implementation  in fabs by as much as 70 percent.
         This  is  a  critical  requirement,   particularly  for  foundries  and
         application  specific  integrated circuit ("ASIC")  manufacturers,  who
         specialize  in  short  runs  of  multiple   products.   Our  Real  Time
         Classification(TM) ("RTC") and in-line ADC ("iADC") technologies, which
         provide  classification and binning of defect types in real time during
         inspection,  are  critical  features  on all  of our  latest-generation
         e-beam and optical inspection tools.

                  In 2001,  we  introduced  our new recipe  management  service,
         called  iRecipe(TM),  which  allows  factory  engineers  to quickly and
         easily access existing  recipes and associated  information that reside
         on a central  database from any personal  computer that is connected to
         the fab  intranet.  By  integrating  iRecipe  into  their fab  network,

         chipmakers  can reduce  their  inspection  and  metrology  tool cost of
         ownership, as well as improve their overall fab efficiency.

Customer Service and Support

         We enhance the value of our products  through our customer  service and
support  programs,  which provide  comprehensive  worldwide  service and support
across all KLA-Tencor product lines. We also offer yield technology  services to
improve our customers' ROI.

         Global Support Services

                  Our customer  support  organization is responsible for much of
         the support of our  customers  following  the shipment of the equipment
         and software,  including  on-site  repair,  telephone  support,  system
         installation,    relocation    services,    and   selected   post-sales
         applications.

                  As  part  of  our   customer   support   program,   we   offer
         iSupport(TM), a fast, comprehensive and secure on-line customer support
         offering that enables our technical support and applications  engineers
         to remotely access data from KLA-Tencor  tools and operate them in real
         time to diagnose and rapidly resolve  problems when they occur--all via
         a secure  on-line  connection  controlled by the customer at all times.
         With the remote diagnostics capabilities offered by iSupport, customers
         can achieve such  benefits as improved  tool  productivity  and overall
         equipment effectiveness, as well as lower CoO.

                  This past June, we unveiled our new iPartner(TM)  portfolio of
         customer support offerings, which leverages a combination of online and
         on-site  resources to cut customer service costs while at the same time
         boosting tool uptime.  Based on our iSupport  technology,  the iPartner
         program takes a tiered  approach that allows  customers to scale at any
         time to the  support  level that  matches  their  unique  and  evolving
         manufacturing  requirements.  It is designed to factor in the change in
         service  and  support  requirements  that occur as process  and product
         cycles mature.  With 7x24 iPartner online support,  customers work with
         KLA-Tencor's  online  engineers to resolve common issues,  reducing the
         need for on-site  dispatch,  thereby reducing costs to the customer and
         increasing  tool  uptime.  Even when an  on-site  visit is  needed  for
         complex issues,  KLA-Tencor  online engineers  diagnose the problem and
         then identify and order the necessary  parts so that the local customer
         support  engineer arrives on-site with the solution and needed parts in
         hand to quickly resolve the problem. This approach reduces mean time to
         repair, further cutting service costs and increasing tool uptime.

                  Our Global  Support  Services'  educational  services  offer a
         comprehensive  selection of  technical  courses  from  maintenance  and
         service training to basic and advanced  applications and operation.  We
         offer standard and customized  courses for  individuals and groups both
         at the user's location and in one of our three training facilities.  We
         also   offer   self-paced    learning   packages,    including   video,
         computer-based training and study plans.

         remote-access  diagnostics.  Use of our  consulting  practice  provides
         accelerated  yield learning rates and improved  device  performance for
         maximum return on investment.

Data Storage Industry

         Outside the semiconductor industry, KLA-Tencor manufactures,  sells and
services  yield  management  solutions to the data storage  market.  In 2001, we
acquired  Phase  Metrics,  the  leading  supplier  of   inspection/certification
technologies to the data storage industry. The acquisition marks the latest move
in our plan to leverage our core  competencies  and  leadership  position in the
global semiconductor  industry to create similar  industry-leading  positions in
other advanced technology markets.

         Phase  Metrics'  tools  and  technologies  complement  the  world-class
KLA-Tencor  systems that already serve as benchmarks for disk and thin film head
metrology.  Whereas KLA-Tencor's  demonstrated technology and expertise focus on
front-end data storage  metrology and  inspection,  Phase Metrics'  efforts have
been focused on data storage  back-end  inspection  and test. By leveraging  the
naturally synergistic products and services from both companies,  in tandem with
their joint sales,  marketing and customer support channels,  the newly combined
entity is expected to create the single  largest yield  management  force in the
data storage industry.

Customers

         To support our growing, global customer base, we maintain a significant
presence throughout the United States,  Europe,  Asia-Pacific and Japan, staffed
with  local  sales  and  applications  engineers,  customer  and  field  service
engineers and yield management consultants. We count among our largest customers
leading semiconductor  manufacturers from each of these regions. In fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000,  no single  customer  accounted  for more than 10  percent of our
revenues.

         Our business  depends upon the capital  expenditures  of  semiconductor
manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand
for ICs and  products  utilizing  ICs.  We do not  consider  our  business to be
seasonal in nature,  but it is cyclical  with  respect to the capital  equipment
procurement  practices  of  semiconductor  manufacturers  and is impacted by the
investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets. Downturns
in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a
material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.


Sales, Service and Marketing

         Our sales,  service  and  marketing  efforts  are  focused on  building
long-term  relationships with our customers.  We focus on providing a single and
comprehensive  resource  for the full  breadth  of  process  control  and  yield
management products and services. Customers benefit from the simplified planning
and coordination,  as well as the increased  equipment  compatibility found when
dealing with a single supplier.  Our revenues are derived primarily from product
sales,  principally  through our direct  sales  force and,  to a lesser  extent,
through distributors.

         We believe that the size and  location of our field sales,  service and
applications  engineering,  and marketing  organizations represent a competitive
advantage  in our  served  markets.  We have  direct  sales  forces in the U.S.,
Europe, Asia-Pacific and Japan. We maintain an export compliance program that is
designed to fully meet the requirements of the U.S.  Departments of Commerce and
State.

         As of  June  30,  2002,  we  employed  over  2,600  sales  and  related
personnel,  service engineers and applications  engineers.  In addition to sales
and service  offices in U.S.,  we conduct  sales,  marketing and services out of
wholly-owned  subsidiaries  or  branches  of U.S.  subsidiaries  in a variety of
countries,  including China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia,  Singapore,  Taiwan,  Thailand and the United  Kingdom.  International
sales  accounted for  approximately  67%, 66%, and 70% of our revenues in fiscal
2002, 2001, and 2000 respectively. Additional information regarding our revenues
from  foreign  operations  for our last three fiscal  years is  incorporated  by
reference  from Note 10 of the Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
found under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

         We  believe  that  sales  outside  the  U.S.  will  continue  to  be  a
significant  percentage of our revenues.  Our future performance will depend, in
part,  on our ability to continue to compete  successfully  in Asia,  one of the
largest markets for the sale of yield management  services in process monitoring
equipment.   Our  ability  to  compete  in  this  area  is  dependent  upon  the
continuation of favorable trading  relationships between countries in the region
(especially Taiwan, China, Japan and South Korea) and the United States, and our
continuing   ability  to  maintain   satisfactory   relationships  with  leading
semiconductor companies in the region.

         International  sales  and  operations  may  be  adversely  affected  by
imposition  of  governmental   controls,   restrictions  on  export  technology,
political   instability,   trade  restrictions,   changes  in  tariffs  and  the
difficulties associated with staffing and managing international  operations. In
addition,  international  sales  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the  economic
conditions in each country.  The revenues  from our  international  business may
also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we attempt
to manage the currency  risk inherent in  non-dollar  sales  through  "hedging,"
there can be no assurance  that such efforts  will be  adequate.  These  factors
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on our future  business  and  financial
results.



Backlog

         Our backlog for system shipments totaled $599 million at June 30, 2002,
compared to $724 million at June 30, 2001.  We include in our backlog only those
customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment
dates within twelve months. In addition,  we exclude from backlog any orders for
non-released  products.  We expect to fill the present  backlog of orders during
fiscal 2003;  however,  all orders are subject to  cancellation  or delay by the
customer  with  limited  or no  penalty.  Due to  possible  customer  changes in
delivery  schedules and to cancellation of orders, our backlog at any particular
date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period.

Research and Development

         The market  for yield  management  and  process  monitoring  systems is
characterized by rapid technological  development and product innovation.  These
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles
and  appropriate   professional   staffing.  We  believe  continued  and  timely
development of new products and enhancements to existing  products are necessary
to maintain  our  competitive  position.  Accordingly,  we devote a  significant
portion  of our  human and  financial  resources  to  research  and  development
programs  and seek to maintain  close  relationships  with  customers  to remain
responsive to their needs. As part of our customer  relationships,  we may enter
into  certain  strategic   development  and  engineering  programs  whereby  our
customers offset certain of our research and development costs.

         Our key research and  development  activities  during  fiscal year 2002
involved   development  of  process  control  and  yield  management   equipment
especially  reticle inspection and advanced wafer inspection for smaller feature
sizes,  copper-based  devices and 300mm wafers.  For  information  regarding our
research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years,  including
costs offset by our strategic development and engineering  programs,  see Item 7
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

         In order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry,
we  are  committed  to  significant  engineering  efforts  toward  both  product
improvement  and  new  product  development.   New  product   introductions  may
contribute  to  fluctuations  in operating  results,  since  customers may defer
ordering  existing  products.  If  new  products  have  reliability  or  quality
problems,  those  problems may result in reduced  orders,  higher  manufacturing
costs,  delays in  acceptance  of and payment for new  products  and  additional
service and warranty expenses. On occasion, we have experienced  reliability and
quality problems in connection with certain product introductions,  resulting in
some of these consequences.  There can be no assurance that we will successfully
develop and manufacture new hardware and software products, or that new hardware
and software products  introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace.  If
we do not successfully introduce new products, our results of operations will be
affected adversely.



Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies

         We perform system design,  assembly and testing in-house and utilize an
outsourcing  strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies.
Our  in-house  manufacturing  activities  consist  primarily of  assembling  and
testing  components  and  subassemblies  that are acquired  through  third-party
vendors and integrating  those  subassemblies  into our finished  products.  Our
principal  manufacturing  activities  take  place  in  San  Jose  and  Milpitas,
California,  with additional  operations in Bedford,  Massachusetts,  San Diego,
Hayward and Fremont,  California,  and Migdal  Ha'Emek,  Israel.  As of June 30,
2002,  we  employed  approximately  1,300  manufacturing  and 1,200  engineering
personnel.

         Many of the parts, components and subassemblies  (collectively "parts")
are standard commercial products,  although certain items are made to KLA-Tencor
specifications.  We use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and
support of our  products.  Although  we make  reasonable  efforts to ensure that
these parts are available from multiple suppliers,  this is not always possible;
and certain  parts  included  in our systems may be obtained  only from a single
supplier or a limited  group of  suppliers.  We endeavor to minimize the risk of
production  interruption by selecting and qualifying  alternative  suppliers for
key parts,  by  monitoring  the  financial  condition  of key  suppliers  and by
ensuring   adequate   inventories   of  key  parts  are  available  to  maintain
manufacturing schedules.

         Although we seek to reduce our  dependence  on sole and limited  source
suppliers,  in some  cases the  partial  or  complete  loss of  certain of these
sources  could  disrupt  scheduled  deliveries  to customers and have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and damage customer relationships.

Competition

         The worldwide market for process control and yield  management  systems
is highly competitive.  In each of our product markets, we face competition from
established and potential competitors, some of which may have greater financial,
research,  engineering,  manufacturing and marketing  resources than us, such as
Applied  Materials,  Inc. and Hitachi  Electronics  Engineering Co., Ltd. We may
also face future  competition  from new market  entrants from other overseas and
domestic  sources.  We expect our  competitors to continue to improve the design
and  performance  of their  current  products and processes and to introduce new
products and processes with improved price and performance  characteristics.  We
believe  that to  remain  competitive,  we will  require  significant  financial
resources to offer a broad range of products,  to maintain  customer service and
support  centers  worldwide  and to invest in product and process  research  and
development.

         Significant  competitive  factors in the market for process control and
yield management systems include system performance,  ease of use,  reliability,
installed base and technical  service and support.  We believe that, while price
and  delivery are  important  competitive  factors,  the  customers'  overriding
requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and



highly  accurate  inspection  and  metrology  capabilities  into their  existing
manufacturing processes, thereby enhancing productivity.

         Our process control and yield management  systems for the semiconductor
industry  are  intended  to  compete  based  upon   performance   and  technical
capabilities.   These   systems  may  compete  with  less   expensive  and  more
labor-intensive manual inspection devices.

         Management believes that KLA-Tencor is a strong competitor with respect
to both its products and services.  However,  any loss of  competitive  position
could negatively impact our prices,  customer orders,  revenues,  gross margins,
and market share, any of which would negatively impact our operating results and
financial condition.

Acquisitions

         We continue to pursue a course of strategic  acquisitions and alliances
to expand our technologies,  product offerings and distribution capabilities. In
fiscal 2002, we acquired substantially all of the assets of QC Optics, Inc. ("QC
Optics"),  a manufacturer of laser-based  inspection  systems for semiconductor,
flat panel and computer hard disk manufacturing industries.

         The financial  position and results of  operations of this  acquisition
were  immaterial in relation to those of  KLA-Tencor  and this  transaction  was
accounted for as a purchase. Further details of our acquisitions during the last
three  fiscal  years are  included  in Note 3 of the  Notes to the  Consolidated
Financial Statements found under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

         Acquisitions  involve numerous risks,  including  management issues and
costs in  connection  with  integration  of the  operations,  technologies,  and
products of the acquired companies, possible write-downs of impaired assets, and
the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.  The inability to
manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and
financial condition.

Patents and Other Proprietary Rights

         We protect our proprietary  technology through reliance on a variety of
intellectual  property laws,  including patent,  copyright and trade secrets. We
have filed and obtained a number of patents in the United  States and abroad and
intend to  continue to pursue the legal  protection  of our  technology  through
intellectual  property laws. In addition,  from time to time we acquire  license
rights  under U.S.  and foreign  patents and other  proprietary  rights of third
parties.

         Due to the rapid pace of  innovation  within the  process  control  and
yield management systems industry,  we believe that our protection of patent and
other  intellectual  property  rights is less important than factors such as our
technological   expertise,   continuing  development  of  new  systems,   market
penetration, installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and
service to customers.


         No  assurance  can be given that  patents  will be issued on any of our
applications,  that license  assignments will be made as anticipated or that our
patents,  licenses or other  proprietary  rights will be  sufficiently  broad to
protect our technology.  No assurance can be given that any patents issued to or
licensed by us will not be challenged,  invalidated or  circumvented or that the
rights  granted  thereunder  will provide us with a  competitive  advantage.  In
addition,  there  can be no  assurance  that we will  be  able  to  protect  our
technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar
or functionally competitive technology.

Employees

         As of June  30,  2002,  we  employed  a total  of  approximately  5,700
persons.  None  of our  employees  are  represented  by a labor  union.  We have
experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.

         Competition   is  intense  in  the   recruiting  of  personnel  in  the
semiconductor and semiconductor  equipment industry.  We believe that our future
success  will  depend  in part on our  continued  ability  to  hire  and  retain
qualified management, marketing and technical employees.


ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

         Information  regarding our principal properties at June 30, 2002 is set
forth below:


                                                    Sales Administration

         We also lease office space for other, smaller sales and service offices
in several  locations  throughout  the world.  Our  operating  leases  expire at
various  times  through  June 30, 2012 with  renewal  options at the fair market
value for additional periods up to five years.  Additional  information of these
leases is incorporated by reference from Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements found under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" in this  Annual  Report  on Form  10-K.  We  believe  our  properties  are
adequately  maintained  and  suitable  for  their  intended  use  and  that  our
production facilities have capacity adequate for our current needs.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         We are named  from time to time as a party to  lawsuits  in the  normal
course of our business.  Litigation,  in general, and intellectual  property and
securities  litigation in particular,  can be expensive and disruptive to normal
business  operations.  Moreover,  the results of complex legal  proceedings  are
difficult to predict.  We believe that we have defenses in each of the cases set
forth below and are vigorously contesting each of these matters.

ADE Corporation

         On October 11, 2000, ADE  Corporation  ("ADE"),  a competitor,  filed a
patent  infringement  lawsuit against  KLA-Tencor in the U.S.  District Court in
Delaware.  ADE claimed  damages and sought an injunction  under U.S.  Patent No.
6,118,525 (`525 patent). We filed a counterclaim in the same court alleging that
ADE has infringed  four of our patents.  We are seeking  damages and a permanent
injunction  against  ADE. In  addition,  we are seeking a  declaration  from the
District Court that ADE's patent is invalid and not infringed by KLA-Tencor.  On
October 22, 2001, we filed a separate  action for declaratory  judgment  against
ADE in the Northern  District of California  requesting a declaration  that U.S.
Patent No. 6,292,259 (`259 patent) is invalid and not infringed. That action has
now been consolidated with the prior action in the Delaware proceeding,  and ADE
has amended its  complaint  in that  proceeding  to allege  that  KLA-Tencor  is
infringing the `259 patent. On August 8, 2002, the magistrate presiding over the
action issued a recommendation that the court enter summary judgment in favor of
KLA-Tencor on the issue of non-infringement under ADE's `525 patent. On the same
day, the magistrate issued recommendations that the court enter summary judgment
in favor of ADE on the issue of non-infringement of two of KLA-Tencor's patents.
While we cannot predict the outcome,  we believe that we have valid defenses and
further believe that our counterclaims have merit.

Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd.

         On June 27,  2001,we sued Tokyo  Seimitsu Co. Ltd. and TSK America Inc.
("TSK"),  a competitor,  in the U.S.  District Court in the Northern District of
California alleging that TSK infringes on one of the Company's patents. The suit
seeks damages and an injunction  under U.S. Patent No.  4,805,123 (`123 patent).
TSK filed a counterclaim  in the same court seeking a declaration  that the `123
patent is invalid,  unenforceable and not infringed, and also alleged violations
of the antitrust and unfair competition laws.

         Although  we cannot  predict  the  outcome of these  claims,  we do not
believe that any of these legal matters will have a material  adverse  effect on
KLA-Tencor.  Were an  unfavorable  ruling to occur in one or more of the pending
claims,  there  exists the  possibility  of a material  impact on our  operating
results for the period in which the ruling occurred.


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         None.


                                                              PART II


ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

         KLA-Tencor's  common  stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market and is
quoted on the NASDAQ  National Market under the symbol KLAC. The price per share
reflected in the following  table  represents  the range of high and low closing
prices  for our  common  stock on the NASDAQ  National  Market  for the  periods
indicated.


         As of September 16, 2002,  there were 1,076  stockholders  of record of
our common stock.

         We have  never  paid  cash  dividends  to our  stockholders  and do not
presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Equity Compensation Plans

         The following table summarizes our equity compensation plans as of June

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

         The following tables reflect selected  consolidated  summary  financial
data for  each of the last  five  fiscal  years.  This  data  should  be read in
conjunction with Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", and with
Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of  Operations"  in this  Annual  Report on Form 10-K.  The per share data shown
below have been restated to reflect  KLA-Tencor's  two-for-one  stock  dividend,
effective January 19, 2000.


         Pro forma  amounts for the periods  beginning  before July 1, 2000 have
not been presented as the effect of the change in accounting principle could not
be reasonably determined.  See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements found under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".





ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

         The  following  discussion  of our  financial  condition and results of
operations  should  be read  in  conjunction  with  our  Consolidated  Financial
Statements and the related notes included in Item 8,  "Financial  Statements and
Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains
forward-looking  statements,  which involve risk and  uncertainties.  Our actual
results could differ  materially  from those  anticipated in the forward looking
statements  as a result of certain  factors,  including but not limited to those
discussed in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K .

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES

         The preparation of our Consolidated  Financial Statements in conformity
with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent  assets and liabilities.  We based these estimates and assumptions on
historical  experience,  and evaluate  them on an on-going  basis to ensure they
remain  reasonable  under current  conditions.  Actual results could differ from
those  estimates.  We discuss the  development  and  selection  of the  critical
accounting  estimates  with the audit  committee  of our board of directors on a
quarterly basis,  and the audit committee has reviewed the Company's  disclosure
relating to them in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The items in our financial
statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows:

         Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement  exists,  the sale  price is fixed  or  determinable,  delivery  has
occurred or services  rendered,  and  collectibility is reasonably  assured.  We
changed our interpretation of "delivery" based on guidance provided in SEC Staff
Accounting  Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101) effective July 1, 2000. Prior to adoption
of SAB 101, we generally recognized system revenue when title transferred to the
customer (mostly upon shipment).  System revenue includes  hardware and software
that is incidental to the product.  We now generally  recognize  system  revenue
upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and
is  operating   according  to  pre-determined   specifications.   This  positive
affirmation  is generally  evidenced  by an  acceptance  document  signed by the
customer.  This change has the impact of prolonging the cycle time between order
placement and revenue  recognition.  In limited  cases,  we allow for exceptions
where we recognize  system  revenue upon shipment if acceptance is not required;
however,  these exceptions have accounted for less than 2.5% of our revenue this
year. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements under "Revenue
Recognition" for detailed description of exceptions.)

         Revenue  from  software  license  fees  is  typically  recognized  upon
shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed
or determinable,  and  vendor-specific  objective  evidence exists to allocate a
portion of the total fee to any undelivered  elements of the  arrangement.  Such
undelivered elements in these arrangements  typically consist of services and/or


upgrades.  If  vendor-specific   objective  evidence  does  not  exist  for  the
undelivered  elements of the  arrangement,  all  revenue is deferred  until such
evidence does exist, or until all elements are delivered,  whichever is earlier.
In instances  where an  arrangement  to deliver  software  requires  significant
modification or customization,  license fees are recognized under the percentage
of completion  method of contract  accounting.  Allowances are  established  for
potential product returns and credit losses. To date,  revenue from license fees
has been less than 10% of total revenue.

         Revenue  from the sale of spare  parts  is  recognized  upon  shipment.
Service  and  maintenance  revenue is  recognized  ratably  over the term of the
maintenance contract.

         The  deferred  system  profit  balance  as of June  30,  2002  was $194
million.  This amount  equals the amount of  deferred  system  revenue  that was
invoiced and due on shipment and deferred under SAB 101 less applicable  product
and warranty costs The deferred  profit  balance  decreased from $422 million at
June 30, 2001 primarily  because  shipments  were lower than revenue  recognized
during fiscal 2002.

         We also  defer the fair value of  non-standard  warranty  bundled  with
equipment sales as unearned  revenue.  Non-standard  warranty  includes services
incremental  to the  standard  40-hour  per week  coverage  for  twelve  months.
Non-standard  warranty  is  recognized  ratably as revenue  when the  applicable
warranty term period commences.  The unearned revenue balance decreased from $71
million at June 30, 2001 to $55 million at June 30,  2002  primarily  due to the
reduction of system revenue from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002.

         Inventory  Reserves We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on
a quarterly basis. For production  inventory,  our methodology involves matching
our on-hand and on-order  inventory with our build forecast over the next twelve
months. The matching is done on a part-by-part basis. We then evaluate the parts
found to be in excess of the twelve-month  demand and take appropriate  reserves
to reflect the risk of  obsolescence.  For spare parts  inventory,  we match our
on-hand  inventory  against  twenty-four  months of usage.  We then evaluate the
parts in excess of the twenty-four month usage and take appropriate  reserves to
reflect risk of obsolescence.  Both methodologies are significantly  affected by
the usage  assumption.  The longer the time period of  estimated  usage the less
reserves  are  required.   Based  on  our  past   experience,   we  believe  the
twelve-month/twenty-four   month  time   periods   best   reflect   the  average
obsolescence  risks.  Given the highly  cyclical  nature and  volatility  in our
product  demand  and spare  parts  usage,  we  occasionally  have to adjust  our
reserves as actual system demand/spare parts usage varies.

         Allowance for Doubtful Accounts A majority of our trade receivables are
derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout
the world.  In order to monitor  potential  credit  losses,  we perform  ongoing
credit  evaluations  of our  customers'  financial  condition.  An allowance for
doubtful  accounts is  maintained  for  potential  credit  losses based upon our
assessment  of the  expected  collectibility  of all  accounts  receivable.  The
allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed  periodically to assess the adequacy
of the allowance.  We take into  consideration (1) any circumstances of which we
are aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) a
certain percentage of the accounts  receivable balance which is based on the age
of the receivables and our historical  experience.  If circumstances change, and


the financial  condition of our customers were adversely  affected  resulting in
their inability to meet their  financial  obligations to us, we may need to take
additional allowances.

         Warranty  We provide  standard  warranty  coverage  on our  systems for
twelve months,  providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during
the warranty period.  We account for the estimated  warranty cost as a charge to
cost of sales when revenue is recognized.  The estimated  warranty cost is based
on historical product  performance and field expenses.  Utilizing actual service
records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and
apply the actual labor and overhead  rates to determine the  estimated  warranty
charge. We update these estimated  charges every six months.  The actual product
performance  and/or field  expense  profiles  may differ,  and in those cases we
adjust our warranty reserves  accordingly.  The difference between the estimated
and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product  introductions  for
which there is limited or no historical product performance on which to base the
estimated warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance
histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates.  Non-standard
warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage
for twelve months.  Non-standard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is
recognized  ratably  as  revenue  when  the  applicable   warranty  term  period
commences.

         Contingencies  and  Litigation  We are  currently  named  as a party to
various legal  proceedings,  including  those outlined in Part I, Item 3, "Legal
Proceedings," in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we currently believe the
ultimate outcome of these  proceedings,  both individually and in the aggregate,
will not have a material  adverse effect on our financial  position or operating
results,  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.  We
would accrue the cost of an adverse judgment if, in our estimation,  the adverse
settlement is probable and we can  reasonably  estimate the ultimate cost to us.
We have made no such accruals as of June 30, 2002.

Results of Operations

         During fiscal 2002, we continued to face a significant  downturn in the
semiconductor  industry  which started early in calendar year 2001.  For several
quarters,  there has been a  worldwide  softening  in demand for  semiconductors
resulting in excess capacity and reduced demand for semiconductor  manufacturing
equipment.

Revenues and Gross Margin

         Product  revenue  decreased  $479 million,  or 25%, to $1.43 billion in
fiscal 2002 from $1.91  billion in fiscal 2001.  Product  revenue  declines were
mostly the result of reduced  capital  spending  as a result of a  semiconductor
industry downturn. Product revenue in fiscal 2001 increased $568 million, or 42%
to $1.91  billion,  from  $1.34  billion  in  fiscal  2000,  as a result  of the
continued  recovery of new order and net sales over the  previous  year as major
semiconductor  manufacturers expanded facilities for additional capacity and new
technology.  In fiscal 2002,  international revenue slightly increased to 69% of
revenue,  from 67% in the prior year,  due to higher demand in Japan and Western
Europe,   partially   offset  by  lower  demand  in  Taiwan.   In  fiscal  2001,
international  revenue decreased to 67% of revenue, from 72% in fiscal 2000, due
to lower demand in Western Europe, Taiwan and Japan.

         Service revenue is generated from  maintenance  service  contracts,  as
well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the
expiration of the warranty  period.  Service  revenues  were $209 million,  $196
million,  and $159 million in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000  respectively.  Service
revenue continued to increase throughout the 3-year-period as our installed base
of equipment at our  customers'  sites  continued to grow. The amount of service
revenue  generated  is  generally  proportional  to the number of  post-warranty
systems installed at our customers' sites and the degree of utilization of those
systems.

         Gross  margins as a  percentage  of revenues  were 50%,  55% and 55% in
fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The decrease in fiscal 2002 compared
to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to reduced capacity utilization, resulting from
lower business volume and an increased percentage of revenue in the lower margin
service  business,  as  well  as  factory  under-absorption  and  higher  excess
inventory  write-offs  due to lower business  levels.  The gross margin ratio in
fiscal 2001 remained flat compared to fiscal 2000.

Engineering, Research and Development

         Net engineering,  research and development  expenses were $287 million,
$356 million,  and $246 million, or 18%, 17% and 16% of revenues in fiscal 2002,
2001, and 2000, respectively.  The dollars decreased in fiscal 2002, compared to
fiscal  2001,  primarily  due  to  temporary  shutdowns,  management  pay  cuts,
reductions in temporary labor and  discretionary  spending as well as other cost
saving  measures  implemented  over the last year. The dollar increase in fiscal
2001,  compared  to  fiscal  2000,  was  primarily   attributable  to  increased
investment in new  technologies  associated  with our ongoing efforts to develop
products which address new market  segments,  enhancements to existing  products
including  next-generation  300mm  products,  and  inspection  enhancements  for
sub-quarter micron technology.

         Net  engineering,  research and  development  expenses  were  partially
offset by $14 million,  $8 million and $16 million in external  funding received
under  certain  strategic  development  programs  conducted  with several of our
customers and government grants in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

         Our future operating  results will depend  significantly on our ability
to produce  products and provide  services that have a competitive  advantage in
our  marketplace.  To do  this,  we  believe  that  we  must  continue  to  make
substantial  investments  in our research  and  development  efforts.  We remain
committed to product development in new and emerging  technologies as we address
the requirements of 0.18 micron and 0.13 micron feature sizes, real-time review,
and the transition to copper  technology.  Our investments in new technology and
existing product  enhancements are intended to enable our customers to achieve a
higher  return on their  capital  investments  and higher  productivity  through
cost-effective, leading edge technology solutions.

Selling, General and Administrative

         Selling,  general and administrative  expenses were $291 million,  $354
million and $268 million, or 18%, 17% and 18% of revenues, in fiscal 2002, 2001,

and 2000,  respectively.  The decrease in dollars in fiscal 2002, as compared to
fiscal 2001,  was primarily  due to temporary  shutdowns,  management  pay cuts,
reductions in temporary labor and discretionary  spending, as well as other cost
saving  measures  implemented  over the last year.  The  increase  in dollars in
fiscal 2001, as compared to fiscal 2000,  was  primarily due to increased  costs
associated with the growth in revenues.

Non-Recurring Acquisition, Restructuring and Other Charges

         The following is summary of  non-recurring  acquisition,  restructuring
and other charges:


Acquisitions

         During the three years ended June 30,  2002,  we  completed a number of
purchase  acquisitions.   The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  include  the
operating  results  of each  business  from the date of  acquisition.  Pro forma
results of  operations  have not been  presented  because  the  effects of these
acquisitions were not material on either an individual or aggregate basis. For a
period of up to twelve  months  from the  acquisition  date,  we may  change our
original  purchase price  allocation for  pre-acquisition  uncertainties.  After
twelve  months,   we  record  the  fair  value  of  such  reasonably   estimable
contingencies.

         The  amounts   allocated  to   in-process   research  and   development
("in-process R&D") were determined through established  valuation  techniques in
the  high-technology  equipment  industry  and were  expensed  upon  acquisition
because   technology   feasibility  had  not  been  established  and  no  future
alternative uses existed. Amounts allocated to goodwill and purchased intangible
assets are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over periods not exceeding  five
years.

         A  summary  of  purchase   transactions  is  outlined  as  follows  (in
thousands):

         The difference between the purchase price and the goodwill, intangibles
and  in-process  R&D  represents  amount  allocated to the net  tangible  assets
acquired. No deferred stock-based  compensation has been recorded for any of the
acquisitions.

Restructuring and Other Charges

         In fiscal 2002, there were no restructuring charges. In fiscal 2001, in
response  to the  downturn  in the  semiconductor  industry,  we  implemented  a
restructuring plan to reduce spending. Charges related to our restructuring plan
included:  facilities of $4.7  million,  severance and benefits of $1.6 million,
and other costs of $1.0 million.  Due to our  downsizing  and  consolidation  of
certain of our  operations,  we vacated two of our leased  office  buildings and
included the remaining net book value of the related  leasehold  improvements as
well as the future lease payments,  net of anticipated  sublease  revenue in the
charge.  We  reduced  our  workforce  by  approximately  5%,  primarily  in  the
manufacturing   areas,   and  recorded   severance   charges  related  to  these
terminations.  In addition,  during the fourth  fiscal  quarter of 2001, we sold
software and  intellectual  property  associated with our  iSupport(TM)  on-line
customer  support  technology and recorded $10.0 million  pretax,  non-recurring
income,  which was netted with the other  non-recurring  charges. As part of the
iSupport(TM)  transaction,  we will record a non-recurring gain of approximately
$15 million in the quarter  ending  September  30, 2002.  During fiscal 2000, we
reversed $8 million of restructuring  reserve that would not be utilized because
of a  change  in  management's  plans  for  utilization  of  certain  facilities
resulting from an increase in demand for our products.

         As of June 30, 2002, the remaining balance of the restructuring reserve
was $0.4 million. Restructuring activity for fiscal 2002 was as follows:



         The  semiconductor  equipment  industry  that we operate in is a highly
cyclical  industry.  This  cyclical  nature  affects our  ability to  accurately
predict future revenue and, thus,  future expense levels.  We are currently in a
down cycle,  and if this current down cycle continues to linger,  we may need to
take appropriate actions to scale operating expenses to our business levels.

Interest Income and Other, Net

         Interest  income and other,  net was $43  million,  $54 million and $42
million in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Interest income and other,
net is comprised primarily of gains realized on sales of marketable  securities,
interest  income  earned  on  the  investment  and  cash  portfolio  and  income
recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency  contracts.  The decrease
in  fiscal  2002 as  compared  to fiscal  2001 was  primarily  due to  decreased
interest income resulting from declining  interest rates. The increase in fiscal
2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to increased  interest  income
resulting from higher interest rate and higher average investment balances.

Provision for Income Taxes

         KLA-Tencor's  effective  income tax rate was 25%, 27% and 28% in fiscal
2002, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  In general,  our effective  income tax rate
differs  from the  statutory  rate of 35%  largely  as a  function  of  benefits
realized  from our  Extraterritorial  Income  (`ETI")  exclusion,  research  and
development tax credits and income derived from tax exempt interest.

         The overall reduction in our effective income tax rate from fiscal 2001
to  fiscal  2002  of 2%,  was the  result  of a  combination  of  factors.  Most
importantly,  more export sales benefits,  more  tax-exempt  interest income and
less state tax expense  compared  relatively to these same items as a percentage
of fiscal 2001 pre-tax income, reduced the rate. These reductions were partially
offset by more  relative  foreign  tax  expense.  The overall  reduction  in our
effective income tax rate from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to a
shift in the geographic composition of our pre-tax income.

         Our future effective  income tax rate depends on various factors,  such
as tax legislation,  the geographic  composition of our pre-tax income,  non-tax
deductible  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with  acquisitions,  amounts  of
tax-exempt  interest income and research and development credits as a percentage
of  aggregate  pre-tax  income,  and  the  effectiveness  of  our  tax  planning
strategies.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         Working capital was $932 million as of June 30, 2002,  compared to $913
million as of June 30, 2001.  Cash, cash  equivalents and short-term  marketable

securities at June 30, 2002  decreased to $673 million from $697 million at June
30, 2001. In addition, we maintained $660 million and $447 million in marketable
securities classified as long-term as of June 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

         KLA-Tencor  has  historically  financed  its  operations  through  cash
generated  from  operations.  Cash  provided by  operating  activities  was $284
million,  $408  million,  and $253  million  in  fiscal  2002,  2001  and  2000,
respectively.  The decrease in cash  provided by operating  activities in fiscal
2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was  primarily  due to decreased  income before the
cumulative  effect of accounting  change and lower accounts  payable,  partially
offset by lower  accounts  receivable  and  inventory  balances.  Income  before
cumulative  effect of accounting  change  decreased in fiscal 2002,  compared to
fiscal 2001,  primarily due to declining  revenues and gross  margins  partially
offset by decreased engineering,  selling,  general and administrative  expenses
associated  with cost saving  measures in  response  to the  industry  slowdown.
Accounts  payable  shrank  due to  decreased  expenditures  and  lower  incoming
invoices.  Accounts  receivable  declined  primarily  due to  strong  collection
efforts,  as well as lower  shipments.  The  reduction in  inventory  was driven
primarily in production  inventory,  where stringent  processes have been put in
place for  managing  material  procurement.  The  increase  in cash  provided by
operating activities in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to
revenue growth and strong collection in accounts receivable, partially offset by
increased  inventory  expenditure  and other  purchases.  During fiscal 2002 and
2001, we sold trade notes and accounts  receivable from Japanese  customers.  At
June 30,  2002 and 2001,  $48 million and $52  million,  respectively,  of these
receivables  and notes were  outstanding,  which have not been  included  in our
consolidated  balance sheet as the criteria for sale  treatment  established  by
SFAS 140 have been met. Under SFAS 140, after a transfer of financial assets, an
entity  derecognizes  financial  assets when control has been  surrendered,  and
derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.

         Cash used in investing  activities  was $376 million,  $295 million and
$96 million in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Investing  activities
typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities,
purchases of capital  assets to support  long-term  growth and  acquisitions  of
technology or other companies to allow access to new market segments or emerging
technologies.  Additions  of  capital  assets  consist  mainly  of  the  planned
completion of our Livermore  facilities.  We anticipate capital  expenditures in
fiscal  2003 to be  significantly  lower  compared  to  fiscal  2002  due to the
completion of the Livermore facilities in fiscal 2002.

         We used $9 million and $58 million of cash in financing  activities  in
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001,  respectively,  and generated $61 million in fiscal
2000. Financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of our common
stock,  as well as  borrowings  and  repayments of debt.  Repurchases  of common
stock,  net of  issuance,  used $8 million  and $60  million in fiscal  2002 and
fiscal  2001,  respectively.  Issuance  of  common  stock,  net of  repurchases,
provided $79 million in fiscal 2000.

         We have adopted a plan for the  systematic  repurchase of shares of our
common  stock  in  the  open  market  to  reduce  the  dilution  created  by our
stock-based employee benefit and incentive plans. In fiscal 2002, we repurchased
3,341,000  shares of our common  stock at an average  price of $36.89 per share,
for a total of $123 million. In fiscal 2001, we repurchased  4,580,000 shares of
our common  stock at an average  price of $33.54 per share,  for a total of $154

million. In fiscal 2000, we repurchased 520,000 shares of our common stock at an
average  price of  $53.80  per  share,  for a total of $28  million.  Since  the
inception of the  repurchase  program in 1997  through  June 30,  2002,  we have
repurchased  a total of  11,349,000  shares at an  average  price of $32.57  per
share. All such shares remain as treasury shares.

         Certain of our leased facilities qualify for operating lease accounting
treatment  under SFAS 13,  "Accounting for Leases," and, as such, the facilities
are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

         The lease  agreement  for  certain  Milpitas  and San Jose,  California
facilities has a term of five years ending in November  2002,  with an option to
extend up to two more years.  Monthly  payments under this lease vary based upon
the London  Interbank  Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.42%.  Under the terms of the
lease,  we, at our option,  can acquire the properties at their original cost or
arrange for the properties to be acquired. Under the terms of the lease, we must
maintain compliance with certain financial  covenants.  As of the date of filing
of this 10-K, we were in compliance with all of tour bank  covenants,  including
the financial covenants.  If we purchase these Milpitas and San Jose, California
facilities  at the  end of the  lease  term,  the  purchase  transactions  would
increase land and property  value by  approximately  $119.3 million and decrease
cash by approximately the same amount. Consequently,  depreciation expense would
increase by approximately  $4.3 million per year, rent expense would decrease by
approximately  $2.9  million per year,  and interest  income  would  decrease by
approximately  $3.6 million per year,  based on current  interest  rates.  If we
choose  not to  purchase  the  facilities,  we will be liable to the  lessor for
residual value guarantees of an aggregate of up to approximately $100.2 million.
Based on current market conditions,  we do not believe that we will have to make
any significant payments associated with the residual value guarantees.

         At June 30, 2002, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.33
billion of cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Our liquidity is affected by
many factors,  some of which are based on the normal  ongoing  operations of the
business,  and others of which relate to the  uncertainties  of global economies
and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries.  Although cash
requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, our
management  believes  that cash  generated  from  operations,  together with the
liquidity provided by existing cash balances,  will be sufficient to satisfy our
liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.

         The  following  is  a  schedule  summarizing   KLA-Tencor   significant
commitments as of June 30, 2002 (in millions):

         Additionally,  we maintain certain open inventory purchase  commitments
with our  suppliers  to  ensure a smooth  and  continuous  supply  chain for key
components.  Our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted
to a forecasted  time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties.  This
forecast  time-horizon  can vary amongst  different  suppliers.  As such,  it is

difficult to accurately report our true open commitments at any particular point
in time.  However, we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of June
30, 2002 to be no more than $60 million.

FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, INCLUDING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Fluctuations in Operating Results and Stock Price

         Our operating  results have varied  widely in the past,  and our future
operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon
a wide variety of factors, including those listed in this section and throughout
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition,  future operating  results may not
follow any past  trends.  We believe  the  factors  that could make our  results
fluctuate and difficult to predict include:

o        the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry;
o        changing global economic conditions;
o        competitive pressure;
o        our ability to develop and implement new  technologies and introduction
         of new products;
o        our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements;
o        intellectual property protection;
o        the shortage of qualified workers in the areas in which we operate; and
o        worldwide political instability.

         Operating  results also could be affected by sudden changes in customer
requirements,  currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions
affecting  customer  demand  and the  cost of  operations  in one or more of the
global  markets in which we do business.  As a result of these or other factors,
we could fail to achieve our  expectations as to future  revenues,  gross profit
and income from operations. Our failure to meet the performance expectations set
and published by external  sources could result in a sudden and significant drop
in the  price of our  stock,  particularly  on a  short-term  basis,  and  could
negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock.

Semiconductor Equipment Industry Volatility

         The semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical. The purchasing
decisions of our  customers  are highly  dependent on the  economies of both the
local  markets  in  which  they  are  located  and  the  semiconductor  industry
worldwide.  The timing,  length and  severity of the  up-and-down  cycles in the
semiconductor  equipment industry are difficult to predict. This cyclical nature
of the industry in which we operate  affects our ability to  accurately  predict
future revenue and,  thus,  future expense  levels.  When cyclical  fluctuations
result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely
affected and cost reduction  measures may be necessary in order for us to remain
competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be in a position
to adjust our cost and expense  structure to prevailing market conditions and to
continue to motivate and retain our key employees.  In addition,  during periods
of  rapid  growth,  we  must  be able to  increase  manufacturing  capacity  and

personnel  to meet  customer  demand.  We can  provide no  assurance  that these
objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry  cycles.  If we
fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.

         Currently, we are in an industry down cycle. We are not able to predict
when  the  semiconductor  industry  will  recover.  During  a  down  cycle,  the
semiconductor  industry typically  experiences  excess production  capacity that
causes semiconductor manufacturers to decrease capital spending. We generally do
not have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not
control the timing or volume of orders placed by our  customers.  Whether and to
what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, as well as the
mix and quantities of products included in those orders,  are factors beyond our
control.  Insufficient  orders,  especially  in our down cycles,  will result in
under-utilization  of our manufacturing  facilities and  infrastructure and will
negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.

International Trade and Economic Conditions

         We serve an  increasingly  global  market.  A  majority  of our  annual
revenues  are  derived  from  outside  the  United  States,  and we expect  that
international  revenues will  continue to represent a substantial  percentage of
our revenues. Our international revenues and operations are affected by economic
conditions  specific  to each  country and  region.  Because of our  significant
dependence on international  revenues,  a decline in the economies of any of the
countries  or  regions  in which we do  business  could  negatively  affect  our
operating results.

         Managing  global  operations  and sites  located  throughout  the world
presents challenges associated with, among other things,  cultural diversity and
organizational  alignment.  Moreover,  each  region in the global  semiconductor
equipment  market  exhibits  unique   characteristics  that  can  cause  capital
equipment  investment  patterns  to vary  significantly  from  period to period.
Periodic  local or  international  economic  downturns,  trade  balance  issues,
political  instability in regions where we have operations,  such as Israel, and
fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our
business  and results of  operations.  Although  we attempt to manage  near-term
currency risks through the use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance
that such efforts will be adequate.

Competition

         Our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to
support customers  worldwide.  Our future performance depends, in part, upon our
ability to continue to compete successfully  worldwide.  Some of our competitors
are diversified  companies with greater  financial  resources and more extensive
research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support
capabilities  than we can provide.  We face  competition  from  companies  whose
strategy  is to provide a broad array of products  and  services,  some of which
compete  with the products and services  that we offer.  These  competitors  may
bundle their products in a manner that may discourage  customers from purchasing
our  products.   In  addition,   we  face   competition  from  smaller  emerging
semiconductor  equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the
products  and  services  which we offer,  using  innovative  technology  to sell

products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could negatively
impact our prices, customer orders,  revenues,  gross margins, and market share,
any of which  would  negatively  affect  our  operating  results  and  financial
condition.  Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would
seriously harm our business.

Technological Change and Customer Requirements

         Success in the semiconductor  equipment  industry depends,  in part, on
continual  improvement  of existing  technologies  and rapid  innovation  of new
solutions.  For example, the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size
of  semiconductor   devices  which  increasing  wafer  size  and  has  begun  to
commercialize  the  process  of  copper-based  interconnects.  These  and  other
evolving  customer  needs  require  us to  respond  with  continued  development
programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have
industry-wide support.  Technical innovations are inherently complex and require
long development cycles and appropriate  professional  staffing. Our competitive
advantage  and future  business  success  depend on our  ability  to  accurately
predict evolving industry standards, to develop and introduce new products which
successfully  address changing customer needs, to win market acceptance of these
new   products  and  to   manufacture   these  new  products  in  a  timely  and
cost-effective  manner.  If we do not develop and  introduce  new  products  and
technologies  in a timely  manner in response to changing  market  conditions or
customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed.

         In this environment,  we must continue to make significant  investments
in  research  and   development  in  order  to  enhance  the   performance   and
functionality  of our products,  to keep pace with  competitive  products and to
satisfy customer demands for improved  performance,  features and functionality.
There  can be no  assurance  that  revenues  from  future  products  or  product
enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with
such  products or  enhancements  or that we will be able to secure the financial
resources  necessary  to  fund  future  development.  Substantial  research  and
development  costs  typically  are  incurred  before we  confirm  the  technical
feasibility  and  commercial  viability  of a product,  and not all  development
activities result in commercially viable products. In addition, we cannot ensure
that these products or  enhancements  will receive market  acceptance or that we
will be able to sell these  products  at prices  that are  favorable  to us. Our
business  will be  seriously  harmed if we are  unable to sell our  products  at
favorable  prices or if our  products are not accepted by the market in which we
operate.

Key Suppliers

         We use a wide range of materials  in the  production  of our  products,
including  custom  electronic  and  mechanical  components,  and we use numerous
suppliers  to supply  materials.  We  generally  do not have  guaranteed  supply
arrangements  with our suppliers.  Because of the  variability and uniqueness of
customers'  orders,  we do not maintain an extensive  inventory of materials for
manufacturing.   We  seek  to  minimize  the  risk  of  production  and  service
interruptions  and/or  shortages  of  key  parts  by  selecting  and  qualifying
alternative  suppliers for key parts,  monitoring the financial stability of key
suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. Although we make
reasonable  efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple  suppliers,
key parts may be  available  only from a single  supplier or a limited  group of

suppliers.Our  business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to
meet our production requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Manufacturing Disruption

         Operations  at our primary  manufacturing  facilities  and our assembly
subcontractors  are subject to  disruption  for a variety of reasons,  including
work stoppages, terrorism, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other
natural  disasters.  In addition,  last year  California  suffered from a severe
energy  shortage,  causing  rolling  blackouts  throughout the state.  In recent
months  there has also been a marked  increase in  hostility in the Middle East.
Such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers. We
cannot ensure that alternate  production  capacity would be available if a major
disruption were to occur or that, if it were available,  it could be obtained on
favorable  terms.  Such a disruption  could result in  cancellation of orders or
loss of customers and could seriously harm our business.

Intellectual Property Obsolescence and Infringement

         Our  success  is  dependent  in  part  on  our   technology  and  other
proprietary  rights. We own various United States and international  patents and
have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and
technologies. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive,
and we cannot be certain  that  pending  or future  applications  will  actually
result in issued patents or that issued  patents will be of sufficient  scope or
strength to provide meaningful  protection or commercial  advantage to us. Other
companies  and  individuals,  including  our  larger  competitors,  may  develop
technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around
the patents we own.

         We also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and
claim copyright  protection for certain proprietary  software and documentation.
However,  we can give no assurance that our  trademarks  and copyrights  will be
upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.

         While patent,  copyright and trademark  protection for our intellectual
property is important,  we believe our future success in highly dynamic  markets
is most  dependent  upon the  technical  competence  and creative  skills of our
personnel.  We  attempt  to  protect  our trade  secrets  and other  proprietary
information  through  confidentiality  and other  agreements with our customers,
suppliers,  employees and  consultants and through other security  measures.  We
also  maintain  exclusive  and  non-exclusive  licenses  with third  parties for
strategic  technology  used  in  certain  products.  However,  these  employees,
consultants and third parties may breach these  agreements,  and we may not have
adequate remedies for wrongdoing.  In addition,  the laws of certain territories
in which we  develop,  manufacture  or sell our  products  may not  protect  our
intellectual  property  rights to the same extent,  as do the laws of the United
States.

         As is typical in the  semiconductor  equipment  industry,  from time to
time we have received  communications from other parties asserting the existence
of patent rights,  copyrights,  trademark rights or other intellectual  property
rights which they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies
or  information.  Our customary  practice is to evaluate such  assertions and to
consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate.  However,  we cannot ensure

that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained,  will be on  acceptable  terms or
that costly litigation or other  administrative  proceedings will not occur. The
inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could
seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.

Key Employees

         Our  employees  are  vital  to our  success,  and our  key  management,
engineering  and other  employees are difficult to replace.  We generally do not
have employment  contracts with our key employees.  Further,  we do not maintain
key  person  life  insurance  on any of our  employees.  The  expansion  of high
technology   companies  worldwide  has  increased  demand  and  competition  for
qualified personnel.  If we are unable to retain key personnel, or if we are not
able to attract,  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified  employees to
meet our needs in the future, our business and operations could be harmed. These
factors could seriously harm our business.

Acquisitions

         In addition to our efforts to develop new  technologies  from  internal
sources, we also seek to acquire new technologies from external sources. As part
of this effort,  we may make  acquisitions  of, or significant  investments  in,
businesses  with   complementary   products,   services   and/or   technologies.
Acquisitions  involve numerous risks,  including  management issues and costs in
connection  with the  integration of the operations and personnel,  technologies
and products of the acquired  companies,  the possible  write-downs  of impaired
assets, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired  companies.  The
inability to manage these risks effectively could seriously harm our business.

Litigation

         From time to time we are  involved  in  litigation  of  various  types,
including litigation that alleges  infringement of intellectual  property rights
and other  claims.  Litigation  tends to be expensive  and requires  significant
management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of
operations  or  business  if we lose or have to  settle a case on  significantly
adverse terms. If we lose in a dispute concerning intellectual property, a court
could require us to pay substantial  damages and/or  royalties or could issue an
injunction prohibiting us from using essential technologies. For these and other
reasons,  this type of litigation  could have a material  adverse  effect on our
business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Also, although we may
seek to obtain a license under a third party's  intellectual  property rights in
order to bring an end to certain claims or actions  asserted  against us, we may
not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all.

Terrorism and Political Instability

         The threat of  terrorism  targeted at the regions of the world in which
we do business,  including the United States,  increases the  uncertainty in our
markets  and may delay any  recovery in the  general  economy.  Any delay in the
recovery of the economy and the  semiconductor  industry could seriously  impact
our business.

         Increased international  political instability,  as demonstrated by the
September 2001 terrorist  attacks,  disruption in air transportation and further

enhanced security measures as a result of the September 2001 terrorist  attacks,
the conflict in Afghanistan  and the increasing  tension in the Middle East, may
hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of  operations.  To
the extent this  instability  continues or otherwise  increases,  we could incur
increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable, increase
insurance costs,  and cause  international  currency markets to fluctuate.  This
same instability  could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability
to timely deliver their products.  If this international  political  instability
continues or increases, our business and results of operations could be harmed.

Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

         In August 2001, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement No. 143 ("SFAS 143"),  "Accounting for Asset Retirement  Obligations,"
which is effective  for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15, 2002.  SFAS 143
applies to all entities and  addresses  financial  accounting  and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated asset retirement  costs. It applies to legal  obligations  associated
with the  retirement  of  long-lived  assets that  result from the  acquisition,
construction,  development,  and/or the normal operation of a long-lived  asset,
except for certain obligations of lessees. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS
143 will have a  significant  impact on our  financial  position  and results of
operations.

         In October  2001,  the FASB  issued  Statement  No.  144 ("SFAS  144"),
"Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of  Long-Lived  Assets."  SFAS 144
addresses  financial  accounting  and reporting for the impairment of long-lived
assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed.  SFAS 144 will be effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We are currently  evaluating the
impact of SFAS 144,  but do not expect  that our  adoption  on July 1, 2002 will
have a material effect on our financial statements.

         In  June  2002,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  No.  146  ("SFAS  146"),
"Accounting  for Costs  Associated with Exit or Disposal  Activities."  SFAS 146
addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal  activities,  and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.
94-3,  Liabilities  Recognition for Certain  Employee  Termination  Benefits and
Other  Costs  to  Exit  an  Activity  (including  Certain  Costs  Incurred  in a
Restructuring).  This Statement  requires that a liability for costs  associated
with an exit or disposal  activity be recognized and measured  initially at fair
value only when the  liability is incurred.  SFAS 146 will be effective for exit
or disposal  activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The standard
will in certain  circumstances change the timing of recognition of restructuring
costs.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

         We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To
mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the
potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our
financial position at June 30, 2002. Actual results may differ materially.

         At the end of fiscal  2002,  we had an  investment  portfolio  of fixed
income  securities of $883 million,  excluding those classified as cash and cash
equivalents  (detail of these  securities  is included in Note 4 of the Notes to
Consolidated  Financial Statements found under Item 8, "Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).  These securities,  as
with all fixed income  instruments,  are subject to interest  rate risk and will
fall in value if market interest rates  increase.  If market interest rates were
to increase  immediately  and  uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2002,
the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $6 million.

         As of June 30, 2002, we had net forward  contracts to sell $115 million
in  foreign  currency  in order to hedge  currency  exposures  (detail  of these
contracts  is  incorporated  by  reference  from  Note  1 of  the  Notes  to the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements under  "Derivative  Instruments".  If we had
entered into these contracts on June 30, 2002, the U.S. dollar  equivalent would
be $124 million.  A 10% adverse move in currency  exchange  rates  affecting the
contracts  would  decrease  the fair  value  of the  contracts  by $15  million.
However, if this occurred,  the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by
the contracts would increase by a similar amount.  Accordingly,  we believe that
the hedging of our foreign  currency  exposure should have no material impact on
income or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Description of Operations and  Principles of  Consolidation  KLA-Tencor
Corporation  ("KLA-Tencor")  is a global  provider of process  control and yield
management   solutions   for  the   semiconductor   manufacturing   and  related
microelectronics industries.  Headquartered in San Jose, California,  KLA-Tencor
has  subsidiaries  both in the United States and in key markets  throughout  the
world.

         The  Consolidated   Financial   Statements   include  the  accounts  of
KLA-Tencor  and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  All  significant  intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

         Management  Estimates The  preparation  of the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements in conformity with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States of America  requires  management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  at the date of the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and
expenses  during the reporting  periods.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

         Fair  Value of  Financial  Instruments  KLA-Tencor  has  evaluated  the
estimated fair value of financial instruments using available market information
and valuation  methodologies.  The use of different  market  assumptions  and/or
estimation  methodologies  could have a significant effect on the estimated fair
value amounts.  The fair value of KLA-Tencor's cash, cash equivalents,  accounts
receivable,  accounts payable and other current  liabilities  approximate  their
carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these items.

         Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents  consist of highly liquid investments
that are valued at amortized cost,  which  approximates  market value,  and have
maturity dates of three months or less from the date of acquisition.

         Marketable Securities Short-term marketable securities include debt and
equity securities acquired with maturities  exceeding three months but less than
one year from the date of acquisition. Non-current marketable securities include
debt and equity securities acquired with maturities  exceeding one year from the
reporting  date.  While  KLA-Tencor's  intent  is to  hold  debt  securities  to
maturity,  KLA-Tencor has classified all debt  securities and all investments in
equity   securities   that   have   readily    determinable   fair   values   as
available-for-sale,  as the sale of such  securities  may be  required  prior to
maturity to implement  management  strategies.  Such  securities are reported at
fair value  determined  based on quoted market prices at the reporting  date for
those  instruments,  with unrealized  gains or losses excluded from earnings and
included in "Accumulated other  comprehensive  income," net of applicable taxes,
until  realized.   The  cost  of  securities  sold  is  based  on  the  specific
identification  method.  Realized gains or losses and declines in value, if any,
judged to be other than  temporary  are reported in "Interest  income and other,
net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

         Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in,
first-out   basis)  or   market.   Demonstration   units  are  stated  at  their
manufacturing cost and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at
their net  realizable  value.  KLA-Tencor  reviews the adequacy of its inventory
reserves on a quarterly basis. Its methodology involves matching its on-hand and
on-order  inventory with its demand forecast on a part-by-part  basis. For parts
that are in  excess  of its  forecasted  demand,  KLA-Tencor  takes  appropriate
reserves to reflect risk of  obsolescence.  If actual demand  declined below its
forecast, KLA-Tencor may need to take additional inventory reserves.

         Property and  Equipment  Property and  equipment  are recorded at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment is based on the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets,  which are 30 years for buildings,  10
years for building improvements, five to seven years for furniture and fixtures,
and three to five years for machinery and equipment.  Leasehold improvements are
amortized  by the  straight-line  method  over  the  shorter  of the life of the
related asset or the term of the underlying lease.  Construction in process does
not depreciate until the assets are placed in service.

         Intangible Assets Purchased technology, patents, trademarks,  favorable
leases and goodwill  are  presented at cost,  net of  accumulated  amortization.
Effective July 1, 2001,  KLA-Tencor  replaced  ratable  amortization of goodwill
with  periodic  testing  of  goodwill  for  impairment  in  accordance  with the
provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and
Intangible  Assets."  Intangible  assets other than goodwill are amortized  over
their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.

         Software  Development  Costs Development costs incurred in the research
and  development  of new  software  products  are  expensed  as  incurred  until
technological  feasibility  of  the  product  has  been  established.   Software
development costs incurred after technological  feasibility has been established
are  capitalized up to the time the product is available for general  release to
customers.  At June 30,  2002 and 2001,  there  were no amounts  capitalized  as
KLA-Tencor's  current development process is essentially  completely  concurrent
with the establishment of technological feasibility.

         Impairment of Long-Lived Assets KLA-Tencor evaluates the carrying value
of its long-lived  assets whenever events or changes in  circumstances  indicate
that the  carrying  value of the asset may be  impaired in  accordance  with the
provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 121,  "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
of." An impairment loss is recognized when estimated  future cash flows expected
to result  from the use of the  asset  including  disposition,  is less than the
carrying value of the asset.

         Concentration of Credit Risk Financial  instruments,  which potentially
subject KLA-Tencor to credit risk, consist principally of investments,  accounts
receivable and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.

         Investments  are maintained  with  high-quality  institutions,  and the
composition and maturities of investments are regularly monitored by management.
Generally,  these  securities  are  traded  in a highly  liquid  market,  may be

redeemed upon demand and bear minimal risk.  KLA-Tencor,  by policy,  limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or commercial issuer.
KLA-Tencor has not experienced any material losses on its investments.

         A majority of KLA-Tencor's  trade receivables are derived from sales to
large   multinational   semiconductor   manufacturers   throughout   the  world.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade  receivables is considered to
be limited due to its customer  base and the diversity of its  geographic  sales
areas.   KLA-Tencor  performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations  of  its  customers'
financial  condition.  KLA-Tencor  maintains a provision  for  potential  credit
losses based upon expected collectibility of all accounts receivable.

         KLA-Tencor is exposed to credit loss in the event of  nonperformance by
counterparties  on the foreign  exchange  contracts used in hedging  activities.
KLA-Tencor does not anticipate nonperformance by these counterparties.

         Foreign Currency The functional currencies of KLA-Tencor's  significant
foreign  subsidiaries  are the local  currencies.  Accordingly,  all  assets and
liabilities of the foreign  operations are translated to U.S. dollars at current
period end exchange  rates,  and revenues  and expenses are  translated  to U.S.
dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period.  The gains and
losses  from  foreign  currency  translation  of these  subsidiaries'  financial
statements  are recorded  directly  into a separate  component of  stockholders'
equity under the caption  "Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income."  Currency
transaction gains and losses have not been significant historically.

         Derivative  Instruments  KLA-Tencor's  foreign subsidiaries operate and
sell KLA-Tencor's products in various global markets. As a result, KLA-Tencor is
exposed to  changes in foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  KLA-Tencor  utilizes
foreign  currency  forward  exchange  contracts to hedge against  certain future
movements  in  foreign  exchange  rates that  affect  certain  foreign  currency
denominated sales and purchase  transactions.  KLA-Tencor  attempts to match the
forward  contracts with the underlying  items being hedged in terms of currency,
amount, and maturity.  KLA-Tencor does not use derivative financial  instruments
for speculative or trading  purposes.  Since the impact of movements in currency
exchange  rates on forward  contracts  offsets most of the related impact on the
exposures  hedged,  these  financial   instruments   generally  do  not  subject
KLA-Tencor  to  speculative  risk that would  otherwise  result from  changes in
currency exchange rates.

         KLA-Tencor  discontinues hedge accounting  prospectively when (1) it is
determined that a derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the
cash flows of a hedged item; (2) the derivative  expires or is sold,  terminated
or exercised;  (3) the derivative is discontinued as a hedge instrument  because
it is unlikely  the  underlying  hedged  transaction  will occur;  (4) because a
hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm  commitment;  or
(5)  management  determines  that  designation  of  the  derivative  as a  hedge
instrument is no longer appropriate.

         In all  situations  in which  hedge  accounting  is  discontinued,  the
derivative will be carried at its fair value on the balance sheet,  with changes
in its fair value recognized in current period  earnings.  When hedge accounting
is discontinued  because it is probable that a forecasted  transaction  will not

occur, the related amounts that were accumulated in other  comprehensive  income
are recognized immediately in earnings.

         At June 30, 2002,  KLA-Tencor had foreign  exchange  forward  contracts
maturing  throughout  fiscal  2003 to sell and  purchase  $155  million  and $40
million,  respectively, in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen. At June 30,
2001,  KLA-Tencor had foreign exchange  forward  contracts  maturing  throughout
fiscal 2002 to sell and purchase $219 million and $60 million,  respectively, in
foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen. All foreign exchange forward contracts
are carried on the consolidated  balance sheets at fair market value. See Note 8
for further information related to derivatives and hedging activities.

         Warranty  KLA-Tencor provides standard warranty coverage on its systems
for a period of twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the
systems  during the warranty  period.  The Company  accounts  for the  estimated
warranty cost as a charge to cost of goods sold when revenue is recognized.  The
estimated warranty cost is based on its historical experience with the product's
performance  in the  field.  If  actual  warranty  activities  differ  from  its
estimates,  the Company records revisions to the estimated warranty liability as
required.  Non-standard  warranty includes services  incremental to the standard
40-hour per week coverage for twelve months.  Non-standard  warranty is deferred
as unearned  revenue and is  recognized  ratably as revenue when the  applicable
warranty term period commences.

         Revenue  Recognition In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff  Accounting
Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." The SEC
Staff  addressed  several  issues in SAB 101,  including  the  timing of revenue
recognition for sales that involve contractual  customer  acceptance  provisions
and  installation  of the  product if these  events  occur  after  shipment  and
transfer  of title.  KLA-Tencor  implemented  the  provisions  of SAB 101 in the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2001, retroactive to July 1, 2000. Prior to adoption of
SAB 101,  KLA-Tencor's  general  policy was to  recognize  revenue on  shipment.
Accordingly,  KLA-Tencor  did not  have any  formal  centralized  processes  for
tracking, obtaining and filing customer acceptance reports; therefore, pro forma
amounts  for the  periods  before  July 1, 2000 have not been  presented  as the
effect of the change in accounting principle could not be reasonably determined.

         KLA-Tencor derives revenue from four sources - system sales, spare part
sales,  service  contracts  and software  license  fees.  System  sales  include
hardware and software that is  incidental to the product.  SAB 101 has no impact
on  KLA-Tencor's  revenue  recognition  policy  for spare  part  sales,  service
contracts and software license fees.

         Prior to the  implementation  of SAB 101,  system revenue was generally
recognized upon shipment.  Effective July 1, 2000, KLA-Tencor changed its method
of accounting  for system sales to generally  recognize  revenue upon a positive
affirmation  by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating
according to predetermined specifications.  In certain limited cases, KLA-Tencor
may deviate from the need for a written acceptance by the customer, as follows:

o        When system sales to  independent  distributors  have no  installation,
         contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment,
         revenue is recognized on shipment;
o        When  the  system   requires  no  integration   and   installation   is
         inconsequential,  revenue is  recognized  on  shipment.  In these cases
         KLA-Tencor  is required to perform the  installation  but it  considers
         installation not essential to the  functionality of the equipment,  and
         there are no  additional  tests  required to be performed  on-site.  In
         addition, third party distributors and customers regularly complete the
         installation of these tools;
o        When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same
         specifications on the same process,  for the same  application,  and it
         can be  objectively  demonstrated  that it  meets  all of the  required
         acceptance  criteria  upon  shipment,  a  portion  of  revenue  may  be
         recognized at the time of shipment. Revenue recognized upon shipment is
         exclusive of the amount allocable to the installation element.  Revenue
         attributable to the  installation  element is the higher of the payment
         amount due upon acceptance or the fair value of installation;
o        When the system is performing in production and meets all published and
         contractually  agreed   specifications,   but  the  customer  withholds
         signature  on our  acceptance  document due to warranty or other issues
         unrelated to product performance.

         Total revenue  recognized under  conditions  where KLA-Tencor  deviated
from the need for a written  acceptance  by the customer  were less than 2.5% of
total revenue for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001.

         In accordance with SAB 101, KLA-Tencor also allows for multiple element
revenue  arrangement in cases where certain elements of a sales contract are not
delivered  and accepted at the same time. In such cases,  KLA-Tencor  defers the
fair value of the  unaccepted  element  until that  element is  delivered to and
accepted by the customer.  To be considered a separate  element,  the product or
service in question  must  represent  a separate  earnings  process,  and is not
essential to the functionality of the delivered and accepted portion of the same
sales contract.  If the unaccepted  element is essential to the functionality of
the delivered and accepted  portion,  the whole amount of the sales  contract is
deferred until all elements are accepted.

         Spare part  revenue is  recognized  when the product has been  shipped,
risk  of loss  has  passed  to the  customer  and  collection  of the  resulting
receivable is probable.

         Service and maintenance  revenue is recognized ratably over the term of
the maintenance  contract.  If maintenance is included in an arrangement,  which
includes a software  license  agreement,  amounts  related  to  maintenance  are
allocated based on vendor specific  objective  evidence.  Non-standard  warranty
includes  services  incremental  to the standard  40-hour per week  coverage for
twelve  months.  Non-standard  warranty is  deferred as unearned  revenue and is

recognized  ratably  as  revenue  when  the  applicable   warranty  term  period
commences.  Consulting  and  training  revenue is  recognized  when the  related
services are performed.

         Revenue  from  software  license  fees  is  typically  recognized  upon
shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed
or determinable,  and  vendor-specific  objective  evidence exists to allocate a
portion of the total fee to any undelivered  elements of the  arrangement.  Such
undelivered elements in these arrangements  typically consist of services and/or
upgrades.  If  vendor-specific   objective  evidence  does  not  exist  for  the
undelivered  elements of the  arrangement,  all  revenue is deferred  until such
evidence does exist, or until all elements are delivered,  whichever is earlier.
In instances  where an  arrangement  to deliver  software  requires  significant
modification or customization,  license fees are recognized under the percentage
of completion  method of contract  accounting.  Allowances are  established  for
potential product returns and credit losses. To date,  revenue from license fees
have been less than 10% of total revenue.

         As a result of implementing SAB 101,  KLA-Tencor  changed its method of
accounting for revenue recognition.  This change resulted in cumulative deferred
system  revenue  of $661  million as of July 1, 2000,  which was  recorded  as a
non-cash  charge of $306 million after  reduction for product and warranty costs
and income taxes.  The deferred  system  profit  balance as of June 30, 2002 was
$194  million and equals the amount of system  revenue that was invoiced and due
on shipment  but  deferred  under SAB 101 less  applicable  product and warranty
costs.

         KLA-Tencor also defers the fair value of non-standard  warranty bundled
with  equipment  sales  as  unearned  revenue.  Non-standard  warranty  includes
services  incremental  to the  standard  40-hour  per week  coverage  for twelve
months.  Non-standard  warranty  is  recognized  as  revenue  ratably  when  the
applicable warranty term period commences.  The unearned revenue balance was $71
million at June 30, 2001 and $55 million at June 30, 2002.

         Advertising Expenses KLA-Tencor expenses advertising costs as incurred.
Advertising  expenses  for  fiscal  2002,  2001 and 2000 were  approximately  $3
million, $6 million and $6 million respectively.

         Strategic   Development   Agreements  Net  engineering,   research  and
development  expenses were partially  offset by $14 million,  $8 million and $16
million  in  external  funding  received  under  certain  strategic  development
programs conducted with several of KLA-Tencor's  customers and government grants
in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

         Income  Taxes  KLA-Tencor  accounts for income taxes under an asset and
liability  approach.  Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for future taxable
amounts and deferred tax assets are recognized for future deductions.

         Earnings Per Share Basic  earnings per share  ("EPS") is  calculated by
dividing net income  available to common  stockholders  by the weighted  average
number of common  shares  outstanding  during the period.  Diluted  earnings per
share is  calculated  by using the  weighted  average  number  of common  shares
outstanding  during the period and gives effect to all dilutive potential common
shares  outstanding  during the period.  The reconciling  difference between the

computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods presented is
the inclusion of the dilutive  effect of stock options issued to employees under
employee stock option plans.

         Options  to  purchase   282,746,   4,459,862  and  211,009   shares  of
KLA-Tencor's  common  stock were  outstanding  at June 30,  2002,  2001 and 2000
respectively,  but not  included in the  computation  of diluted EPS because the
exercise  price was greater than the average  market  price of common  shares in
each respective  year. The exercise price ranges of these options were $52.75 to
$68.00,  $44.69 to $68.00 and $56.31 to $68.00 at June 30, 2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.

         Stock-Based  Compensation  Plans  KLA-Tencor  accounts for its employee
stock  option  plans  and  employee  stock  purchase  plan  in  accordance  with
provisions of APB 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees."  KLA-Tencor
provides additional pro forma disclosure  required by SFAS 123,  "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation" (see Note 6).

         Reclassifications  Certain prior period balances have been reclassified
to conform to the current financial statement presentation.

         Recent   Accounting   Pronouncements  In  August  2001,  the  Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  Statement  No. 143  ("SFAS  143"),
"Accounting  for Asset  Retirement  Obligations,"  which is effective for fiscal
years  beginning  after June 15,  2002.  SFAS 143  applies to all  entities  and
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible  long-lived  assets and the associated  asset  retirement
costs.  It  applies  to legal  obligations  associated  with the  retirement  of
long-lived assets that result from the acquisition,  construction,  development,
and/or  the  normal  operation  of  a  long-lived  asset,   except  for  certain
obligations of lessees.  KLA-Tencor  does not expect the adoption of SFAS 143 to
have a significant impact on its financial position and results of operations.

         In October  2001,  the FASB  issued  Statement  No.  144 ("SFAS  144"),
"Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of  Long-Lived  Assets."  SFAS 144
addresses  financial  accounting  and reporting for the impairment of long-lived
assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed.  SFAS 144 will be effective for
fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2001.  KLA-Tencor  is  currently
evaluating the impact of SFAS 144, but does not expect that its adoption on July
1, 2002 will have a material effect on its financial statements.

         In  June  2002,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  No.  146  ("SFAS  146"),
"Accounting  for Costs  Associated with Exit or Disposal  Activities."  SFAS 146
addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal  activities,  and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.
94-3,  Liabilities  Recognition for Certain  Employee  Termination  Benefits and
Other  Costs  to  Exit  an  Activity  (including  Certain  Costs  Incurred  in a
Restructuring).  SFAS 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an
exit or disposal  activity be  recognized  and measured  initially at fair value
only when the  liability  is  incurred.  SFAS 146  applies  to exit or  disposal
activities  that are initiated  after December 31, 2002. This Statement will, in
certain circumstances, change the timing of recognition of restructuring costs.

Statements of Operations



NOTE  3 - NON-RECURRING ACQUISITION, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

         The following is summary of  non-recurring  acquisition,  restructuring
and other charges.


Acquisitions

         During the three years in the period  ended June 30,  2002,  KLA-Tencor
completed  a  number  of  purchase  acquisitions.   The  Consolidated  Financial
Statements  include  the  operating  results of each  business  from the date of
acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the

effects of these  acquisitions  were not  material  on either an  individual  or
aggregate basis. For a period of up to twelve months from the acquisition  date,
KLA-Tencor may change its original purchase price allocation for pre-acquisition
uncertainties.  After twelve months,  KLA-Tencor  records the fair value of such
reasonably estimable contingencies.

         The  amounts   allocated  to   in-process   research  and   development
("in-process R&D") were determined through established  valuation  techniques in
the  high-technology  equipment  industry  and were  expensed  upon  acquisition
because   technology   feasibility  had  not  been  established  and  no  future
alternative uses existed. Amounts allocated to goodwill and purchased intangible
assets are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over periods not exceeding  five
years.

         A  summary  of  purchase   transactions  is  outlined  as  follows  (in
thousands):

         The difference between the purchase price and the goodwill, intangibles
and  in-process  R&D  represents  amount  allocated to the net  tangible  assets
acquired. No deferred stock-based  compensation has been recorded for any of the
acquisitions.

Restructuring and Other Charges

         In fiscal 2002, there were no restructuring charges. In fiscal 2001, in
response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry, KLA-Tencor implemented a
restructuring plan to reduce spending. Charges related to its restructuring plan
included:  facilities of $4.7  million,  severance and benefits of $1.6 million,
and other costs of $1.0 million.  Due to its  downsizing  and  consolidation  of
certain of its operations, KLA-Tencor vacated two of its leased office buildings
and included the remaining net book value of the related leasehold  improvements
as well as the future lease payments, net of anticipated sublease revenue in the
charge.  During fiscal 2002,  KLA-Tencor  reduced its workforce by approximately
5%, primarily in the manufacturing  areas and recorded severance charges related
to these  terminations.  In addition,  during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001,
KLA-Tencor  sold  software  and  intellectual   property   associated  with  its
iSupport(TM)  on-line  customer  support  technology  and recorded $10.0 million
pretax,  non-recurring  income,  which was netted  with the other  non-recurring
charges.  As part of the  iSupport(TM)  transaction,  the Company  will record a
non-recurring  gain of approximately $15 million in the quarter ending September
30, 2002.  During fiscal 2000, we reversed $8 million of  restructuring  reserve
that  would  not be  utilized  because  of a change  in  management's  plans for
utilization of certain  facilities  resulting from an increase in demand for our
products.

         As of June 30, 2002, the remaining balance of the restructuring reserve
was $0.4 million. Restructuring activity for fiscal 2002 was as follows:

NOTE 4 - MARKETABLE SECURITIES

     The   amortized    costs   and   estimated   fair   value   of   securities
available-for-sale as of June 30, 2002 and 2001 are as follows:


         The   contractual   maturities   of  debt   securities   classified  as
available-for-sale  as of June 30, 2002,  regardless of the consolidated balance
sheet classification, are as follows:
                                                           Estimated
June 30, 2002 (in thousands)                               Fair Value
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due within one year                                     $     542,482
Due after one year through five years                         654,465
Due after five years                                            5,772
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        $   1,202,719

         Actual  maturities  may  differ  from  contractual  maturities  because
borrowers may have the right to call or prepay  obligations with or without call
or prepayment penalties.  Net realized gains and losses for the years ended June
30,  2002 and 2001 were not  material  to  KLA-Tencor's  financial  position  or
results of operations.

NOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES

                  The components of income before income taxes are as follows:

         The  provision   (benefit)  for  income  taxes  are  comprised  of  the
following:



         Actual  current  tax  liabilities  are lower than  reflected  above for
fiscal years 2002,  2001 and 2000 by $60 million,  $56 million and $132 million,
respectively,  due to the stock option deduction benefits recorded as credits to
capital in excess of par value.

         The significant  components of deferred income tax assets (liabilities)
are as follows:


         The  reconciliation  of the United States federal  statutory income tax
rate to KLA-Tencor's effective income tax rate is as follows:

         United  States  federal  income  taxes have not been  provided  for the
undistributed  earnings  of  two of  KLA-Tencor's  foreign  subsidiaries.  These
undistributed  earnings  aggregated  $37 million at June 30, 2002, and it is the
Company's intention that such undistributed earnings be permanently  reinvested.
The Company has tax credit at June 30, 2002  totaling $70 million,  of which $23
million will begin to expire in 2021.  The Company enjoys tax holidays in Israel
where it manufactures certain of its products.  These tax holidays are scheduled
to expire at varying  times  within the next ten years.  The effect of these tax
holidays  has not had a  material  impact on the  Company's  net  income and net
income per share.

NOTE 6 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

         Stockholders' Rights Plan In March 1989, KLA-Tencor  implemented a plan
to  protect  stockholders'  rights  in  the  event  of a  proposed  takeover  of
KLA-Tencor.  Each stockholder under the plan is entitled to one right per common
stock owned.  The Plan was amended in April 1996.  The Plan provides that if any
person or group acquires 15% or more of  KLA-Tencor's  common stock,  each right
not owned by such person or group will  entitle its holder to  purchase,  at the
then-current exercise price,  KLA-Tencor's common stock at a value of twice that
exercise price. As amended to date, under the Plan, the rights are redeemable at
KLA-Tencor's option for $0.01 per right and expire in April 2006.

         Stock  Repurchase   Program  In  July  1997,  the  Board  of  Directors
authorized KLA-Tencor to systematically repurchase shares of its common stock in
the open  market.  This  plan was  entered  into to  reduce  the  dilution  from
KLA-Tencor's  employee  benefit and incentive plans such as the stock option and
employee stock purchase plans.  In fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000,  KLA-Tencor
repurchased  3,341,000,  4,580,000  and  520,000  shares at an average  price of
$36.89,  $33.54 and $53.80 per share,  respectively.  Since the inception of the
repurchase  program in 1997 through June 30, 2002,  KLA-Tencor has repurchased a
total of  11,349,000  shares at an average  price of $32.57 per share.  All such
shares remain as treasury shares.

         Stock Split For  stockholders of record on January 4, 2000,  KLA-Tencor
effected a  two-for-one  stock  split of its  common  stock in the form of a 100
percent stock  dividend.  The stock  dividend was paid on January 19, 2000.  All
prior-period  share and per share  amounts  have been  adjusted to reflect  this
transaction retroactively.

         Employee Stock Purchase Plan KLA-Tencor's  employee stock purchase plan
provides that  eligible  employees  may  contribute up to 10% of their  eligible
earnings  toward the  semi-annual  purchase of  KLA-Tencor's  common stock.  The
employee's  purchase  price is derived  from a formula  based on the fair market
value of the common stock at the time of  enrollment  into the  Offering  period
versus the fair  market  value on the date of  purchase.  Offering  periods  are
generally two years in length. As the plan is non-compensatory  under APB 25, no
compensation  expense is recorded in  connection  with the plan. In fiscal years
2002, 2001 and 2000, employees purchased  1,155,213,  1,275,837 and 1,935,031 of
shares  issued at a weighted  average  fair value of $29.72,  $28.59 and $13.28,

respectively.  The plan shares are replenished annually on the first day of each
fiscal year by virtue of an  evergreen  provision.  The  provision  allows for a
share  replenishment  equal to the lesser of  2,000,000  shares or the number of
shares  which the  Company  estimates  will be  required to issue under the plan
during the  forthcoming  fiscal year.  At June 30, 2002,  1,602,401  shares were
reserved and available for issuance under this plan.

         Stock Option and Incentive Plans KLA-Tencor's stock option program is a
broad-based,  long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain
qualified management and technical employees ("knowledge employees"),  and align
stockholder and employee interests.  The plans provide for awards in the form of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights, and performance
shares.  As of June 30, 2002,  only stock  options  have been awarded  under the
plans.  Under  KLA-Tencor's  stock option plans,  options generally have vesting
periods of four or five years,  are  exercisable  for a period not to exceed ten
years from the date of issuance and are granted at prices not less than the fair
market  value of  KLA-Tencor's  common  stock at the grant  date.  This  program
consists of three plans: one under which  non-employee  directors may be granted
options  to  purchase  shares  of our  stock,  another  in which  officers,  key
employees,  consultants  and all other  employees may be granted options and one
other in which  consultants  and all employees other than directors and officers
may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock. Substantially all of our
employees that meet established  performance goals and that qualify as knowledge
employees  participate  in one of our stock  option  plans.  Options  granted to
employees from fiscal year 1999 through June 30, 2002 are summarized as follows:


         During   fiscal  2002,   the  Company   granted   options  to  purchase
approximately 9.8 million shares of stock to employees, which was a net grant of
options  for 8.0 million  shares  after  deducting  options  forfeited.  The net
options granted after forfeiture represented 4.2% of total outstanding shares of
approximately 189.8 million as of June 30, 2002.

         Options  granted to the top five  officers as a percentage of the total
options  granted to all employees  vary from year to year. In 2002,  they were a
higher  percentage  of the total  grants  than in the other  years shown as they
included  Board of  Director  approved  additional  grants to Mr.  Schroeder  in
recognition  of his future  potential to lead the  corporation.  The  additional
grants to Mr.  Schroeder  total  227,400  options  with  vesting on said  grants

extended out for up to an eight-year  period.  These  additional  grants are not
made every  year.  For  additional  information  about the  compensation  of our
executive  officers and stock option grants to our top five executive  officers,
please refer to our proxy statement dated September 20, 2002.

         All stock option grants to officers are made with a review by, and with
the  approval  of the  Compensation  Committee  of the Board of  Directors.  All
members of the Compensation Committee are independent  directors,  as defined in
the  applicable  rules for issuers  traded on the NASDAQ Stock  Market.  See the
"Report of the Compensation  Committee on Executive  Compensation"  appearing in
KLA-Tencor's  proxy statement dated September 20, 2002, for further  information
concerning  the policies  and  procedures  of  KLA-Tencor  and the  Compensation
Committee regarding the use of stock options.

         The following table  summarizes  KLA-Tencor's  stock option plans as of
June 30, 2002(1):

(1)      In August 2002,  the Board of Directors  authorized  an increase in the
         number of securities  reserved for additional future issuance under the
         Company's stock option plans (other than the Company's  [Director Stock
         Option  Plan]) of an aggregate of  7,589,102  shares.
(2)      Officers  and  directors  are not eligible to receive  options  granted
         under this plan.

         In December 2000,  employees of KLA-Tencor were offered the opportunity
to exchange  their stock options with exercise  prices over $55.00 per share and
all  subsequently  issued  options  for a promise to issue new options no sooner
than six months and two days after the cancellation of the forfeited options. If
an employee elected to participate in the exchange  program,  they were required
to exchange  all options  issued  during the period six months prior to December
2000 as well as six months  subsequent  to December  2000.  The new options were
granted on July 10, 2001 at an exercise price of $46.67,  the price equal to the
NASDAQ closing price of KLA-Tencor's  common stock on the same day. The terms of
the new option  replicated  the  surrendered  option.  A total of 278  employees
canceled an  aggregate  of 722,814  options with  exercise  prices  ranging from
$26.25 to $68.00 per share.

         The activity under the option plans, combined, was as follows:



         The  options  outstanding  at June 30, 2002 have been  segregated  into
ranges for additional disclosure as follows:


         The  weighted  average  fair value of options  granted in fiscal  years
2002,  2001  and 2000 was  $21.87,  $25.93  and  $24.15,  respectively.  Options
exercisable were  13,436,155,  9,807,250 and 6,777,749 as of June 30, 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

         Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Pro forma information regarding
net  income  and net  income  per share is  required  by SFAS 123,  and has been

determined as if KLA-Tencor  had accounted for its employee  stock purchase plan
and employee stock options granted  subsequent to June 30, 1995,  under the fair
value  method of SFAS 123.  The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes  option valuation model and the single
option approach with the following weighted-average assumptions:


         The  Black-Scholes  option  valuation  model was  developed  for use in
estimating the fair value of traded  options which have no vesting  restrictions
and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  option  valuation models require the
input of highly  subjective  assumptions  including  the  expected  stock  price
volatility.  Because  KLA-Tencor's  employee  stock  option and  employee  stock
purchase plans have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options,  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate,  in management's opinion, the existing models do
not  necessarily  provide a  reliable  single  measure of the fair value of such
Company options.

         For  purposes  of pro  forma  disclosures  required  by SFAS  123,  the
estimated  fair value of the options is  amortized  to expense over the options'
vesting periods using straight-line  method.  KLA-Tencor's pro forma information
is as follows:


         Other Employee  Benefit Plans  KLA-Tencor has a profit sharing  program
for eligible employees which distributes,  on a quarterly basis, a percentage of
pretax  profits.  In  addition,  KLA-Tencor  has an employee  savings  plan that
qualifies as a deferred salary  arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Starting fiscal year 2000,  KLA-Tencor has matched up to a maximum
of $1,000 or 50% of the first $2000 of an eligible employee's contribution, with
$500 of the amount funded from the profit sharing  program.  The total charge to
operations  under the profit sharing and 401(k) programs  aggregated $3 million,
$57 million and $38 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

         KLA-Tencor  has a  non-qualified  deferred  compensation  plan  whereby
certain  key  executives  may  defer  a  portion  of  their  salary  and  bonus.
Participants  are  credited  with  returns  based on their  allocation  of their
account  balances  among mutual funds.  The Company  controls the  investment of
these  funds and the  participants  remain  general  creditors  of the  Company.
Distributions  from the plan  commence  the quarter  following  a  participant's
retirement or  termination  of  employment.  At June 30, 2002,  KLA-Tencor had a
deferred  compensation  liability  under the plan of $69  million  included as a
component of other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

         Factoring  KLA-Tencor has agreements with a bank to sell certain of its
trade  receivables and promissory  notes without  recourse.  During fiscal 2002,
approximately $98 million of receivables were sold under these arrangements.  As
of June 30, 2002,  approximately $48 million were outstanding.  The total amount
available under the facility is the Japanese yen equivalent of $50 million based
upon  exchange  rates as of June 30,  2002.  KLA-Tencor  does not  believe it is
materially at risk for any losses as a result of these agreements.

         Facilities  KLA-Tencor leases certain of its facilities under operating
leases,  which qualify for operating lease  accounting  treatment under SFAS 13,
"Accounting for Leases," and, as such,  these facilities are not included on its
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

         The  following  is  a  schedule  of  operating   leases   payments  (in
thousands):

                Fiscal year ended June 30,                       Amount
                -------------------------------------------------------
                2003                                         $    9,386
                2004                                              5,188
                2005                                              2,985
                2006                                              1,367
                Thereafter                                        1,048
                -------------------------------------------------------

                Total minimum lease payments                 $   19,974
                =======================================================

         The lease  agreement  for  certain  Milpitas  and San Jose,  California
facilities has a term of five years ending in November  2002,  with an option to
extend up to two more years.  Monthly  payments under this lease vary based upon
the London  Interbank  Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.42%.  Under the terms of the
lease,  KLA-Tencor,  at its option, can acquire the properties at their original

cost or arrange for the properties to be acquired. Under the terms of the lease,
KLA-Tencor must maintain compliance with certain financial covenants. As of June
30, 2002, KLA-Tencor was in compliance with all of its covenants. If the Company
purchases  the Milpitas and San Jose,  California  facilities  at the end of the
lease term,  the  purchase  transactions  would  increase  land and  property by
approximately $119.3 million and decrease cash by approximately the same amount.
If the Company chooses not to purchase the facilities,  it will be liable to the
lessor for residual  value  guarantees  of an  aggregate of up to  approximately
$100.2 million.

         Legal  Matters  From  time to time  KLA-Tencor  is  named as a party to
lawsuits in the normal  course of its  business.  Litigation,  in  general,  and
intellectual property litigation in particular,  can be expensive and disruptive
to  normal  business  operations.   Moreover,   the  results  of  complex  legal
proceedings are difficult to predict.  KLA-Tencor  believes that it has defenses
in each of the cases set forth below and is vigorously  contesting each of these
matters.

ADE Corporation

         On October 11, 2000, ADE  Corporation  ("ADE"),  a competitor,  filed a
patent  infringement  lawsuit against  KLA-Tencor in the U.S.  District Court in
Delaware.  ADE claimed  damages and sought an injunction  under U.S.  Patent No.
6,118,525 (`525 patent). We filed a counterclaim in the same court alleging that
ADE has infringed  four of our patents.  We are seeking  damages and a permanent
injunction  against  ADE. In  addition,  we are seeking a  declaration  from the
District Court that ADE's patent is invalid and not infringed by KLA-Tencor.  On
October 22, 2001, the Company filed a separate action for  declaratory  judgment
against ADE in the Northern District of California requesting a declaration that
U.S.  Patent No.  6,292,259  (`259  patent) is invalid and not  infringed.  That
action  has  now  been  consolidated  with  the  prior  action  in the  Delaware
proceeding,  and ADE has amended its complaint in that proceeding to allege that
KLA-Tencor  is infringing  the `259 patent.  On August 8, 2002,  the  magistrate
presiding over the action issued a  recommendation  that the court enter summary
judgment in favor of  KLA-Tencor  on the issue of  non-infringement  under ADE's
`525 patent.  On the same day, the magistrate  issued  recommendations  that the
court enter summary judgment in favor of ADE on the issue of non-infringement of
two of  KLA-Tencor's  patents.  While we cannot predict the outcome,  we believe
that we have valid  defenses  and further  believe that our  counterclaims  have
merit.

Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd.

         On June 27,  2001,  the Company  sued Tokyo  Seimitsu  Co. Ltd. and TSK
America Inc. ("TSK"),  a competitor,  in the U.S. District Court in the Northern
District of  California  alleging  that TSK  infringes  on one of the  Company's
patents.  The suit  seeks  damages  and an  injunction  under  U.S.  Patent  No.
4,805,123  (`123 patent).  TSK filed a counterclaim  in the same court seeking a
declaration  that the `123 patent is invalid,  unenforceable  and not infringed,
and also alleged violations of the antitrust and unfair competition laws.

         Although KLA-Tencor cannot predict the outcome of these claims, it does
not believe that any of these legal matters will have a material  adverse effect
on KLA-Tencor.  However,  were an unfavorable  ruling to occur in one or more of
the  pending  claims,  there  exists the  possibility  of a  material  impact on


KLA-Tencor's  operating  results and financial  position for the period in which
the ruling occurred.

NOTE 8 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

         Under  its  foreign-currency   risk  management  strategy,   KLA-Tencor
utilizes  derivative  instruments  to protect its interests  from  unanticipated
fluctuations  in  earnings  and cash  flows  caused by  volatility  in  currency
exchange rates.  This financial  exposure is monitored and managed by KLA-Tencor
as an integral part of its overall risk management  program which focuses on the
unpredictability  of  financial  markets  and  seeks to reduce  the  potentially
adverse  effects that the  volatility of these markets may have on its operating
results.  KLA-Tencor continues its policy of hedging its current and anticipated
foreign  currency  exposures  with hedging  instruments  having  tenors of up to
twelve months.

         On  July  1,  2001,   KLA-Tencor  adopted  SFAS  133,  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities"  (SFAS 133). SFAS 133 requires
that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  Changes in
the fair value of  derivatives  which do not  qualify,  or are not  effective as
hedges must be  recognized  currently  in  earnings.  Upon  adoption  KLA-Tencor
recognized the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts, previously held
off balance sheet,  and reflected  their fair value on the balance sheet.  These
were principally offset by recording on the balance sheet the change in value of
the hedged item, generally forecasted  shipments.  KLA-Tencor did not separately
report a  cumulative  transition  adjustment  to earnings  upon  adoption of the
standard as the impact was immaterial.  All  derivatives  were reflected at fair
value on the balance sheet at that date.

Cashflow Hedges

         KLA-Tencor's  international  sales are  primarily  denominated  in U.S.
dollars. For foreign currency denominated sales,  however, the volatility of the
foreign currency  markets  represents risk to KLA-Tencor's  margins.  KLA-Tencor
defines     its     exposure     as    the    risk    of    changes    in    the
functional-currency-equivalent  cash flows (generally U.S. dollar)  attributable
to changes in the related foreign currency  exchange rates. Upon forecasting the
exposure,  KLA-Tencor  hedges with forward sales  contracts whose critical terms
are  designed  to match  those of the  underlying  exposure.  These  hedges  are
evaluated  for  effectiveness  at least  quarterly  using  regression  analysis.
Ineffectiveness  is  measured  by  comparing  the change in value of the forward
contracts  to the  change  in  value  of the  underlying  transaction,  with the
effective portion of the hedge accumulated in Other Comprehensive  Income (OCI).
Any measured  ineffectiveness  is included  immediately in "Interest  income and
other, net" in the Consolidated  Statements of Operations.  An immaterial amount
of  ineffectiveness  was  recognized  during the year.  Deferred hedge gains and
losses and OCI associated with hedges of foreign currency sales are reclassified
to revenue upon  recognition in income of the underlying  hedged  exposure.  All
amounts  reported in OCI at June 30, 2002 are  anticipated to be reclassified to
revenue within twelve months. The following table summarizes hedging activity in
the OCI account during the years ended June 30, (in thousands):


Other Foreign Currency Hedges

         KLA-Tencor hedges its monetary  non-functional  assets and liabilities,
and those of its  subsidiaries.  SFAS 52 requires that such monetary  assets and
liabilities  be  remeasured  periodically  for  changes in the rate of  exchange
against the entities' functional currency.  Changes in value of these assets and
liabilities are recorded in "Interest income and other, net" in the Consolidated
Statements  of  Operations.  The  volatility  of the  non-functional  currencies
together with the requirement to remeasure non-functional assets and liabilities
may  result  in some  volatility  to  KLA-Tencor's  Consolidated  Statements  of
Operations if left  unhedged.  In order to mitigate  these  effects,  KLA-Tencor
enters into remeasurement  hedges which are forward contracts used to offset the
foreign currency  positions  represented by  non-functional  monetary assets and
liabilities.  Remeasurement  hedges  are not SFAS 133  designated  hedges,  thus
changes in value of the remeasurement hedges are recorded currently in earnings.


NOTE 9 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

         Effective  July 1, 2001,  KLA-Tencor  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 141,  "Business  Combinations," and No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets." Under these new accounting  standards,  KLA-Tencor
ceased amortization of goodwill recorded for business  combinations  consummated
prior to July 1, 2001,  and  reclassified  amounts  attributed  to  workforce in
acquisitions  made  prior to July 1,  2001  that did not meet the  criteria  for
separate recognition as an intangible asset under SFAS 141 to goodwill.  The net
carrying value of goodwill recorded through  acquisitions is $15.1 million as of
June 30, 2002. In accordance  with SFAS 142,  KLA-Tencor  concluded there was no
impairment of goodwill.

         The  following  table  reflects the  consolidated  results  adjusted as
though the adoption of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 occurred as of the beginning of the
year ended June 30, 2001 (in thousands, except per share amounts):


         The following table reflects the components of other intangible  assets
as of June 30, 2002 (in thousands):


         Other  intangible  assets are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over
their  estimated  useful  lives.  For the years  ended  June 30,  2002 and 2001,
amortization  expense  for other  intangible  assets was $2.1  million  and $1.0
million,  respectively.  Estimated  amortization  expense  for  each of the four
succeeding fiscal years is as follows (in thousands):

=========================================================================

NOTE 10 -- SEGMENT REPORTING AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

         In  fiscal  1999,  KLA-Tencor  adopted  SFAS  131,  "Disclosures  about
Segments  of an  Enterprise  and  Related  Information."  SFAS  131  establishes
standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial
statements  and  requires  that certain  selected  information  about  operating
segments be reported in interim financial reports. It also establishes standards
for related  disclosures  about  products and services,  and  geographic  areas.
Operating  segments  are  defined as  components  of an  enterprise  about which
separate  financial  information is evaluated  regularly by the chief  operating
decision maker, or decision-making  group, in deciding how to allocate resources
and in assessing  performance.  KLA-Tencor's chief operating decision makers are
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer.

         KLA-Tencor  is  engaged  primarily  in  designing,  manufacturing,  and
marketing yield management and process  monitoring systems for the semiconductor
industry.   All   operating   units   have   been   aggregated   due  to   their
inter-dependencies,  commonality of long-term economic characteristics, products
and  services,  the  production  processes,  class of customer and  distribution
processes.  Since  KLA-Tencor  operates in one segment,  all  financial  segment
information  required  by SFAS 131 can be found  in the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.

         KLA-Tencor's significant operations outside the United States include a
manufacturing  facility in Israel and sales,  marketing  and service  offices in
Western Europe, Japan, and the Asia Pacific region. For geographical  reporting,
revenues  are  attributed  to the  geographic  location in which the customer is
located.  No  single  customer  accounted  for 10% or more  of net  revenues  or
accounts  receivable in any of the periods presented.  Long-lived assets consist
of  net  property  and  equipment,  goodwill,  capitalized  software  and  other
intangibles, and other long-term assets, excluding long-term deferred tax assets
and are  attributed to the  geographic  location in which they are located.  The

following is a summary of  operations by entities  located  within the indicated
geographic areas for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000.


         The  following  is a summary of revenues by major  products  for fiscal

         The following table presents certain unaudited  consolidated  quarterly
financial   information   for  the  eight  quarters  ended  June  30,  2002.  In
management's  opinion,  this  information has been prepared on the same basis as
the audited  Consolidated  Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Form

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of KLA-Tencor Corporation

In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of KLA-Tencor
Corporation  and its  subsidiaries at June 30, 2002 and 2001, and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended June 30, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in  the  United  States  of  America.   These   financial   statements  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management;  our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  statements in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and  disclosures  in the financial  statements,
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  and evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
