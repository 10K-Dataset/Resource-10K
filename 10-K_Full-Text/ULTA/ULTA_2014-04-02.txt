Part I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Ulta Beauty (or Ulta, we, the Company) is the largest beauty retailer that
provides one-stop shopping for prestige, mass and salon products and salon services in the United States. We focus on providing affordable indulgence to our customers by combining unmatched product breadth, value and convenience with the distinctive
environment and experience of a specialty retailer. Key aspects of our business include:

One-Stop
Shopping

.    Our customers can satisfy all of their beauty needs at Ulta. We offer a unique combination of more than 20,000 prestige and mass beauty products organized by category in a bright, open store environment. The
beauty products are arranged in self-service displays and full-service boutiques in a way that encourages our customers to enjoy discovering new products and services. We believe we offer the widest selection of categories across prestige and mass
cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products and salon styling tools. We also offer a full-service salon and a wide range of salon haircare products in all of our stores.

Our Value Proposition

.    We believe our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers
across all of our product categories drives customer loyalty. We offer frequent promotions and coupons, in store events, gift-with-purchase offers, a comprehensive customer loyalty program and targeted promotions through our Customer Relationship
Management platform (CRM).

An Off-Mall Location

.    Our stores are predominantly located in
convenient, high-traffic locations such as power centers. Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. Our store design, fixtures and open layout provide the
flexibility to respond to consumer trends and changes in our merchandising strategy.



We were founded as a Delaware corporation in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass and
salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products, drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. We developed a
unique specialty retail concept combining one-stop shopping, a compelling value proposition, convenient locations and a welcoming shopping environment.

The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
included in Item 7 and the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our
competitive strengths

We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us and are critical to our success:

D

ifferentiated merchandising strategy with broad appeal

.    We believe our broad selection of merchandise across
categories, price points and brands offers a unique shopping experience for our customers. While the products we sell can be found in department stores, specialty stores, salons, drug stores and mass merchandisers, we offer all of these products in
one retail format so that our customers can find everything they need in one shopping trip. We offer more than 500 brands, such as Bare Minerals and Urban Decay prestige cosmetics, Nyx and Maybelline mass cosmetics, Coty and Estée Lauder
fragrances, Redken and Matrix haircare, as well as Dermalogica and Philosophy skincare and Clarisonic and Ultra Chi personal care appliances. We also offer private label Ulta products in key categories such as cosmetics, skincare and bath. Because
we offer a broad array of products in prestige, mass and salon, we appeal to a wide range of customers including women of all ages, demographics, and lifestyles.

Our unique customer experience

.    We combine unmatched product breadth, value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer. Our
well-trained, non-commissioned beauty advisors provide unbiased and customized advice tailored to our customers’ needs. Our customer service strategy, convenient locations and attractive store design combine to create a unique shopping
experience.

L

oyal and active customer base

.    Approximately thirteen million Ulta customers are members of
our loyalty program. We use this valuable proprietary database to drive traffic, better understand our customers’ purchasing patterns and support new store site selection. We regularly employ a broad range of media, including digital, catalogs
and newspaper inserts and targeted promotions driven by our CRM platform, to drive traffic to our stores and website.

Strong vendor
relationships across product categories

.    We have strong, active relationships with over 300 vendors, including Bare Minerals, Coty, Estée Lauder, L’Oréal and Procter & Gamble. We believe
the scope of these relationships, which span the three beauty categories of prestige, mass and salon and which have taken years to develop, creates a significant impediment for other retailers to replicate our model. We work closely with our vendors
to market both new and existing brands in a collaborative manner.

Experienced management team

.    We have an
experienced senior management team that brings a creative merchandising approach and a disciplined operating philosophy to our business. We continue to expand the depth of our management team at all levels and in all functional areas to support our
growth.

Five point growth strategy

We intend to expand our presence as a leading retailer of beauty products and salon services by pursuing the following growth strategies:

Growing stores to approximately 1,200 locations

.    We believe that over the long-term, we have the potential to grow our store base to approximately 1,200 Ulta stores in the
United States. Our internal real estate model takes into account a number of variables, including demographic and sociographic data as well as population density relative to maximum drive times, economic and competitive factors. We plan to continue
opening stores both in markets in which we currently operate and new markets.



We opened 127 new stores during fiscal 2013, representing a 22% increase in square footage growth and a 25%
increase in the number of new stores opened compared to 102 new stores in fiscal 2012. We also remodeled 7 stores and relocated 4 stores in fiscal 2013. Our fiscal 2013 new store program was comprised of approximately 70% new stores opened in
existing shopping centers and 30% in new shopping centers. In fiscal 2013 approximately one third of new stores were in new markets and two thirds were filling in existing markets.

Expanding our offering by adding new products, brands and services

.    Our strategy is to
continue to expand our portfolio of products, brands and services both by capitalizing on the success of our existing vendor relationships and by identifying and developing new vendor relationships. Over the last several years we have added new
products from existing vendors across product categories. We have also added a number of new brands in recent years, most notably in our prestige category which is currently the beauty industry’s highest growth category. Fiscal 2013 brand
additions included IT Cosmetics, Lipstick Queen, Mally, Meaningful Beauty and Perricone. We continue to roll out Clinique and Lancôme boutiques, ending the year with 100 stores with Clinique boutiques and 105 stores with Lancôme
boutiques. We also offer haircare services in our full service salons as well as skin and brow services in most of our stores. We plan to establish Ulta as a leading salon authority by providing high quality and consistent services from our licensed
stylists and by expanding our portfolio of services.

Enhancing our successful loyalty program

.    We have
approximately thirteen million active Ulta customers who are enrolled in our loyalty program. Loyalty member transactions represent approximately 80% of our annual total net sales, and the transaction data demonstrates that loyalty members shop with
higher frequency and spend more per visit as compared to non-members. In early fiscal 2014, we converted all of our loyalty customers to ULTAmate Rewards, a points-based program. The customer data captured by our loyalty program, together with our
CRM platform, also enables customer segmentation and one-on-one marketing communications tailored to our customers’ unique beauty needs. We believe our loyalty program combined with our growing CRM capabilities provide significant long-term
opportunity for Ulta.

Broadening our marketing reach

.    We believe our marketing initiatives are a key component
of our success, providing an effective means to introduce new products, brands and services to our existing and potential new customers. We have historically utilized primarily direct mail advertising, catalogs and newspaper inserts to communicate
with our customers. We plan to continue to leverage our print marketing while expanding our reach into other marketing channels, including digital marketing, social media and e-mail marketing. In addition, we continue to enhance in-store marketing
and special events to educate customers and drive traffic. We plan to continue to focus on our in-store marketing and in-store special events as an additional means of educating our customers and increasing the frequency of their visits to our
stores. We believe Ulta has a significant opportunity to attract new customers to our stores and website and we expect to increase our marketing efforts to drive greater awareness of our brand.

Expanding our digital business

.    Our e-commerce platform serves two roles: to generate direct channel sales and profits and
to communicate with our customers in an interactive, enjoyable way to reinforce the Ulta brand and drive traffic to our stores and website. We continue to aggressively develop and add new website features and functionality, marketing programs,
product assortment, new brands and multi-channel integration points. We intend to establish ourselves as a leading online beauty resource by providing our customers with a rich online



experience for information on key trends and products, editorial content, expanded assortments, best in class features and functionality and social media content. In 2013 we re-launched ulta.com
with enhanced content and capabilities and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth of e-commerce sales of beauty products. We believe our website and retail stores provide our customers with an integrated shopping experience and
increased flexibility for their beauty buying needs.

Our market

We operate within the large and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry. This market represents approximately $113 billion in retail sales, according to Euromonitor International and IBIS
World Inc. The approximately $65 billion beauty products industry includes color cosmetics, haircare, fragrance, bath and body, skincare, salon styling tools and other toiletries. Within this market, we compete across all major categories as well as
a range of price points by offering prestige, mass and salon products. The approximately $48 billion salon services industry consists of hair, skin and nail services.

Competition

Our major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional
department stores such as Macy’s and Nordstrom, specialty stores such as Sephora and Bath & Body Works, drug stores such as CVS/pharmacy and Walgreens, mass merchandisers such as Target and Wal-Mart and the online businesses of the
aforementioned retailers as well as pure play e-commerce business such as Amazon. Our competitive advantages are the quality and assortment of merchandise and services, our value proposition, the quality of our customers’ shopping experience
and the convenience of our stores and website as one-stop destinations for beauty products.

The market for salon services and products is
highly fragmented. Our competitors for salon services and products include Regis, Sally Beauty, JCPenney salons and independent salons.

Stores

Our stores are predominantly
located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power centers. Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. We opened 127 (125 net of closings) stores in
fiscal 2013 and the average investment required to open a new Ulta store is approximately $1.0 million, which includes capital investments, net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory, net of payables. Our net
investment required to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors, including geographic location. We expect the net investment to open a new store in 2014 to increase due to increases in
material and labor costs resulting from a stronger commercial and residential building environment compared to the last several years. As of February 1, 2014, we operated 675 stores in 46 states.

Store remodel program

Our retail store
concept, including physical layout, displays, lighting and quality of finishes, has evolved over time to match the rising expectations of our customers and to keep pace with our merchandising and operating strategies. We have a formal store remodel
program in place to update our older stores to provide a consistent shopping experience across all of our locations. We remodeled 7 stores in fiscal 2013. Approximately 95% of our store base features our most current store design. The average
investment to remodel a store in fiscal 2013 was approximately $1.2 million. Each remodel takes approximately three months to complete, during which time we generally keep the store open.

Salon

We operate full-service salons in all of our stores. Our current Ulta store format
includes an open and modern salon area with approximately eight to ten stations. The entire salon area is approximately 950 square feet with a concierge desk, skin treatment room or dedicated skin treatment area, semi-private shampoo and hair color
processing areas. Each salon is a full-service salon offering haircuts, hair coloring and permanent texture, with



most salons also providing facials and waxing. We continue to expand our service offering, adding services, such as gel manicures, microdermabrasion and hair extensions, to select locations. We
employ licensed professional stylists and estheticians who offer highly skilled services as well as an educational experience, including consultations, styling lessons, skincare regimens, and at-home care recommendations.

Ulta.com

Our e-commerce business
represented approximately 4% of our total sales and grew 74% in fiscal 2013. Ulta.com supports the key elements of our brand proposition and provides access to more than 18,000 beauty products from hundreds of brands. With the new e-commerce
platform launched in 2013, we expect Ulta.com to become an even greater element in our marketing programs and a more important resource for our customers to access product and store information, beauty trends and techniques and buy from a larger
assortment of product offerings. We are confident our e-commerce business will continue to deliver rapid growth in in the future, but will likely begin to moderate off a larger base. During 2013 we expanded our e-commerce distribution capabilities
by adding fulfillment to the Chambersburg, Pennsylvania distribution center.

Merchandising

Strategy

We focus on offering one
of the most extensive product and brand selections in our industry, including a broad assortment of branded and private label beauty products in cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products and salon styling tools. A typical Ulta
store carries more than 20,000 prestige and mass beauty products. We present these products in an assisted self-service environment using centrally produced planograms (detailed schematics showing product placement in the store) and promotional
merchandising planners. Our merchandising team continually monitors current fashion trends, historical sales trends and new product launches to keep Ulta’s product assortment fresh and relevant to our customers. We believe our broad selection
of merchandise, from moderate-priced brands to higher-end prestige brands, offers a unique shopping experience for our customers. Many of the products we sell can also be found in department stores, specialty stores, salons, mass merchandisers and
drug stores, but we offer all of these products so that our customers can find everything they need in one stop. We believe we offer a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories. We offer frequent promotions
and coupons, in store events, gift-with-purchase offers, a comprehensive customer loyalty program and targeted promotions through our CRM platform.

We believe our private label products are a strategically important category for growth and profit contribution. Our objective is to provide quality, trend-right private label products to continue to
strengthen our customers’ perception of Ulta as a contemporary beauty destination. Ulta manages the full development cycle of these products from concept through production in order to deliver differentiated packaging and formulas to build
brand image. Current Ulta cosmetics and bath brands have a strong following and we may expand our private label products into additional categories. Ulta brand products represented approximately 5% of total company sales in fiscal 2013.

in the following categories:

Ÿ

Cosmetics, which includes products for the face, eyes, cheeks, lips and nails;

Ÿ

Haircare, which includes shampoos, conditioners, styling products, and hair accessories;

Organization

Our merchandising
team consists of a Chief Merchandising Officer overseeing a team of category Vice Presidents and their team of buyers. Our merchandising team works with our centralized merchandise planning and forecasting group to ensure a consistent execution
across our store base and e-commerce platform.

Our planogram department assists the merchants and replenishment team to keep new products
flowing into stores on a timely basis. All major product categories undergo planogram revisions on a regular basis and adjustments are made to assortment mix and product placement based on current sales trends.

Our visual department works with our merchandising team on strategic placement of promotional merchandise, along with functional and educational signage
and creative product presentation standards, in all of our stores. All stores receive a centrally produced promotional planner to ensure consistent implementation of our marketing programs.

Planning and allocation

We have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a
dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our merchandising strategy. We centrally manage product replenishment to our stores through our merchandise planning group. This group serves as a strategic partner to, and provides
financial oversight of, the merchandising team. The merchandising team creates a sales forecast by category for the year. Our merchandise planning group creates an open-to-buy plan, approved by senior executives, for each product category. The
open-to-buy plan is updated weekly with point-of-sale (POS) data, receipts and inventory levels and is used throughout the year to balance buying opportunities and inventory return on investment. We believe this structure maximizes our buying
opportunities while maintaining organizational and financial control. Regularly replenished products are presented consistently in all stores utilizing a merchandising planogram process. POS data is used to calculate sales forecasts and to determine
replenishment levels. We determine promotional product replenishment levels using sales histories from similar or comparable events. To ensure our inventory remains productive, our planning and replenishment group, along with senior executives,
monitor the levels of clearance and aged inventory in our stores on a weekly basis.

Vendor relationships

We have close relationships with our more than 300 vendors. Our top ten vendors represented approximately 51% of our total annual sales in fiscal 2013.
These include vendors across all product categories, such as Bare Minerals, Coty, Estée Lauder, L’Oréal and Procter & Gamble, among others. We believe our vendors view us as a significant distribution channel for growth
and brand enhancement.

Marketing and advertising

Marketing strategy

We employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy to increase brand
awareness, drive traffic to our stores and website, acquire new customers, improve customer retention and increase frequency of shopping. We communicate with our customers and prospective customers through multiple vehicles. Our primary marketing
expenditure is in direct mail catalogs and free-standing newspaper inserts which highlight the breadth of our selection of prestige, mass and salon beauty products, new products and services and special offers. We execute a comprehensive public
relations strategy to enhance Ulta’s reputation as a beauty destination, increase brand awareness, support our charitable efforts on behalf of The Breast Cancer Research Foundation and drive awareness of new products, in-store events and new
store openings.

Our loyalty program is an important tool to increase retention of existing customers and to enhance their loyalty to the Ulta
brand. Approximately thirteen million active customers are enrolled in this loyalty program, generating approximately 80% of Ulta’s annual total net sales. In early fiscal 2014, we converted all of our



loyalty customers to ULTAmate Rewards, a points-based program. ULTAmate Rewards enables customers to earn points based on their purchases. Points earned are valid for at least one year and
may be redeemed on any product we sell. In late 2012 we implemented the new CRM solution to enable more sophisticated mining of the customer data in our loyalty member database as well as greater personalization of our
marketing. Throughout 2013 we built upon our CRM capabilities to deliver targeted marketing campaigns to our loyalty program members.

A
growing percentage of our marketing expense was directed at our digital marketing strategy as a highly effective channel to communicate with existing customers and reach customers who are not familiar with Ulta or who have not yet shopped with
us. Our online marketing strategy includes search engine optimization, paid search, mobile advertising, affiliate relationships, such as online coupons sites, social media, display advertising, and other digital marketing channels. Ulta’s
email marketing programs are effective in communicating with online and retail customers and driving sales.

Staffing and operations

Retail

Our
current Ulta store format is staffed with a general manager, a salon manager, two associate managers, one part time manager, and approximately twenty full and part-time associates, including approximately six to eight prestige consultants and eight
to ten licensed salon professionals. The management team in each store reports to the general manager. The general manager oversees all store activities including salon management, inventory management, merchandising, cash management, scheduling,
hiring and guest services. Members of store management receive bonuses depending on their position and based upon various metrics. Each general manager reports to a district manager, who in turn reports to a Regional Vice President of Operations who
in turn reports to the Senior Vice President of Operations who in turn reports to our Chief Executive Officer. Each store team receives additional support from time to time from recruiting specialists for the retail and salon operations, regionally
based human resource managers, a field loss prevention team, salon technical trainers, management trainers and vendors.

Ulta stores are open
seven days a week, eleven hours a day, Monday through Saturday, and seven hours on Sunday. Our stores have extended hours during the holiday season.

Salon

A typical salon is staffed with eight to ten licensed salon professionals,
including a salon manager, six stylists, and one or two estheticians. Our most productive salons have a guest coordinator and an assistant manager. Our salon technical trainers and vendor education classes create a comprehensive educational program
for approximately 5,000 Ulta salon professionals.

Training and development

Our success is dependent in part on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified associates at all levels of the organization. We have
developed a corporate culture that enables individual store managers to make store-level operating decisions and consistently rewards their success. We are committed to continually developing our associates and providing career advancement
opportunities. Our associates and management teams are essential to our store expansion strategy. We use a combination of existing managers, promoted associates and outside hires to support our new stores.

All of our associates participate in an interactive new-hire orientation through which each associate becomes acquainted with Ulta’s purpose and
values. Training for new store managers, prestige consultants and sales associates familiarizes them with our beauty products, opening and closing routines, guest service expectations, our loss prevention policy and procedures, and our culture. We
provide continuing education to salon professionals and retail associates throughout their careers at Ulta. Our learning management system allows us to provide ongoing training to all associates to continually enhance their product knowledge,
technical skills and guest service expertise. In contrast to the sales teams at traditional department stores, our retail sales teams are



not commissioned. Our prestige consultants are trained to work across all prestige lines and within our prestige boutiques, where customers can receive makeup demonstrations and skin analysis.

Distribution

We operate
three distribution facilities. The first facility, located in Romeoville, Illinois, is approximately 317,000 square feet in size, including an overflow facility. The second distribution facility is in Phoenix, Arizona and is approximately 437,000
square feet in size. The third distribution center, located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, opened in April 2012. The Chambersburg warehouse contains approximately 373,000 square feet. We are embarking on a multi-year supply chain project beginning
in 2014 which will include adding additional capacity, including a fourth distribution center expected to open in 2015, and system improvements to support expanded omni-channel capabilities.

Inventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution facilities. We carry more than 20,000 products and replenish our stores with such products primarily in eaches (i.e., less-than-case
quantities), which allows us to ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a particular product is required. Our distribution facilities use warehouse management and warehouse control software systems to maintain and support product
purchase decisions. Store replenishment order selection is performed using pick-to-light processing technologies. Product is delivered to stores using a broad network of contract and local pool (final mile) carriers. We fulfill

e-commerce

orders from our Romeoville, Illinois and Chambersburg, Pennsylvania distribution centers.

Information technology

We are committed
to using technology to enhance our competitive position. We depend on a variety of information systems and technologies to maintain and improve our competitive position and to manage the operations of our growing store base. We rely on computer
systems to provide information for all areas of our business, including supply chain, merchandising, POS, e-commerce, finance, accounting and human resources. Our core business systems consist mostly of purchased software programs that integrate
with our internally developed software solutions. Our technology also includes a company-wide network that connects all corporate users, stores, and our distribution infrastructure and provides communications for credit card and daily polling of
sales and merchandise movement at the store level. We intend to leverage our technology infrastructure and systems where appropriate to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems, people and processes. We update the
technology supporting our stores, distribution infrastructure and corporate headquarters on a regular basis. We will continue to make investments in our information systems to facilitate our growth and enable us to enhance our competitive position.

Intellectual property

We
have registered over 30 trademarks in the United States and other countries. The majority of our trademark registrations contain the ULTA mark, including Ulta Salon Cosmetics Fragrance (and design), Ulta.com, and Ulta Beauty and two related designs.
We maintain our marks on a docket system to monitor filing deadlines for renewal and continued validity. All marks that are deemed material to our business have been applied for or registered in the United States and select foreign countries,
including Canada.

We believe our trademarks, especially those related to the Ulta brand, have significant value and are important to building
brand recognition.

Government regulation

We are affected by extensive U.S. laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints may exist at the
federal, state or local levels in the United States. The cosmetic, dietary supplement, food and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products we sell in our stores, including our Ulta branded products, are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and State Attorneys General (AG) in the United States. Such regulations principally relate to the safety of ingredients, proper labeling, manufacturing, advertising, packaging and distribution
of the products.



Products classified as cosmetics (as defined in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FDC) Act) are not subject to
pre-market approval by the FDA, but the products and the ingredients must generally be safe and must be properly manufactured and labeled. Certain products, such as sunscreens and acne treatments, are classified as OTC drugs, and certain ingestible
products, such as vitamins and minerals, are classified as dietary supplements. Both OTC drugs and dietary supplements have specific ingredients, labeling and manufacturing requirements. The labeling of these products is subject to the requirements
of the FDC Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Further, claims we make in advertising, including claims about the safety or efficacy of products, pricing claims and environmental claims, are subject to regulation by the FTC and State
AG’s who generally prohibit deceptive practices.

The government regulations that most impact our day-to-day operations are the labor and
employment and taxation laws to which most retailers are typically subject. We are also subject to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws (both federal and state). Our salon business
is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements for our stylists and our salon procedures.

In our store leases, we
require our landlords to obtain all necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning approvals and permits for our specific use (but at times the responsibility for obtaining
zoning approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us). We require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located. We are responsible for
delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or build-outs that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or build-outs.

Employees

As of February 1, 2014,
we employed approximately 6,900 people on a full-time basis and approximately 12,700 on a part-time basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relationships with our
employees.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Investment in our common
stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Form 10-K before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks occur, our
business, financial condition, results of operations or future growth could suffer. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

The health of the economy in the channels we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. In addition, the recent global economic crisis and volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets may adversely
affect our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.

Our results of operations may be materially affected by
conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and internationally. Concerns over inflation, employment, tax laws, energy costs, healthcare costs, geopolitical issues, terrorism, the availability and cost of
credit, the mortgage market, sovereign and private banking systems, sovereign deficits and increasing debt burdens and the real estate and other financial markets in the U.S. and Europe have contributed to increased volatility and diminished
expectations for the U.S. and certain foreign economies. We appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and premium salon services. Continued uncertainty in the
economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories, including prestige beauty products and premium salon services. Factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such
discretionary purchases include: general business conditions, levels of employment, interest rates, tax rates, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. In the event of a prolonged economic downturn
or acute recession, consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower than expected net sales.

In addition,
the recent global economic crisis and volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a significant, adverse impact on global economic conditions, resulting in recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and
economic growth. While these declines have moderated, the level of consumer spending is not where it was prior to the global recession, and economic conditions could lead to further declines in consumer spending in the future. Additionally, there
can be no assurance that various governmental activities to stabilize the markets and stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence or change spending habits. Reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and
changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers, and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Recent economic conditions have also resulted in a tightening of the credit markets, including lending by financial institutions, which is a source of
capital for our borrowing and liquidity. This tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties
specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers. These factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike, and a corresponding
decrease in global infrastructure spending. While global credit and financial markets appear to be recovering from extreme disruptions experienced over the past few years, uncertainty about continuing economic stability remains. It is difficult
to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue, the extent to which they will continue to recover, if at all, and which aspects of our products or business may be adversely affected. Current market
and credit conditions could continue to make it more difficult for developers and landlords to obtain the necessary credit to build new retail centers. A significant decrease in new retail center development could limit our future growth
opportunities as long as the aforementioned conditions exist.

Additionally, the general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely
affect our commercial partners including our product vendors as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located. A bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant
vendor or a



number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.

We may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets.

The markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry even when economic conditions are favorable. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, both
small and large, including regional and national department stores, specialty retailers, drug stores, mass merchandisers, high-end and discount salon chains, locally owned beauty retailers and salons, Internet businesses, catalog retailers and
direct response television, including television home shopping retailers and infomercials. We believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise, our value proposition, the quality of our customers’ shopping
experience and the convenience of our stores as one-stop destinations for beauty products and salon services. Many of our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources
and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we
can. As a result, we may lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

If we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales will decrease.

We believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to:

Ÿ

recognize and define product and beauty trends;

Ÿ

anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;

Ÿ

translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product and service offerings in our stores and salons in advance of our competitors;

Ÿ

develop and maintain vendor relationships that provide us access to the newest merchandise on reasonable terms; and

Ÿ

distribute merchandise to our stores in an efficient and effective manner and maintain appropriate in-stock levels.

If we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the regions in which we operate, our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to
increase markdowns of slow-moving merchandise, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

If we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and
cash flows.

Our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization. This execution requires an experienced and
talented management team. Mary Dillon was appointed Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors effective July 1, 2013 and Scott Settersten was appointed Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary effective
March 12, 2013. If we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of key executive personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. Furthermore, our
ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train, motivate and manage our associates. We will need to attract, motivate and retain additional qualified executive, managerial and merchandising personnel and store
associates. Competition for this type of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably.



Our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons,
which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.

Our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have
fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance, including:

Ÿ

general U.S. economic conditions and, in particular, the retail sales environment;

Ÿ

changes in our merchandising strategy or mix;

Ÿ

performance of our new and remodeled stores;

Ÿ

the effectiveness of our inventory management;

Ÿ

timing and concentration of new store openings, including additional human resource requirements and related pre-opening and other start-up costs;

Ÿ

cannibalization of existing store sales by new store openings;

Ÿ

levels of pre-opening expenses associated with new stores;

Ÿ

timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, such as catalogs and newspaper inserts;

Ÿ

seasonal fluctuations due to weather conditions; and

Ÿ

actions by our existing or new competitors.

Accordingly, our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter, and comparable store sales for any particular future period may
decrease. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely decline. For more information on our quarterly results of operations, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

We may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully develop and implement our long-range strategic and
financial plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. In addition, we intend to continue to open new stores, which could strain our resources and have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Our continued and future growth largely depends on our
ability to implement our long-range strategic and financial plan and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis. Our senior management is currently evaluating our long-range strategic and financial plan to align and prioritize
our growth strategies, as well as additional investments that will be needed to support continued and future growth. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plan or long-range strategic initiatives, and
our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. During fiscal 2013, we opened 127 new stores. We intend to continue to grow our number of stores for the
foreseeable future, and believe we have the long-term potential to grow our store base to approximately 1,200 stores in the United States. During fiscal 2013, the average investment required to open a typical new store was approximately $1.0
million. Our continued expansion places increased demands on our financial, managerial, operational, supply-chain and administrative resources. For example, our planned expansion will require us to increase the number of people we employ as well as
to monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems and our distribution infrastructure. These increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less efficiently and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

The capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment
infrastructure may not be adequate to support our recent growth and expected future growth plans, which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur costs to expand this infrastructure, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

We operate three distribution facilities, which
house the distribution operations for Ulta retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our e-commerce business. In order to support our recent and expected future



growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business, additional distribution centers may need to be added in the future. We are embarking on a multi-year supply chain project beginning
in 2014 which will include adding additional capacity, including a fourth distribution center expected to open in 2015, and system improvements to support expanded omni-channel capabilities. Our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our
distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Any significant interruption in the operations of our distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a
timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

We
distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with direct-to-store arrangements from vendors or wholesalers. We are a retailer carrying over 20,000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty
trends, which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure. Any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure, such as disruptions in our information
systems, disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or shipping and transportation problems, could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our
stores, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Any material
disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations, particularly during the holiday season.

We are increasingly dependent on a variety of information systems to effectively manage the operations of our growing store base and fulfill customer orders from our e-commerce business. We have
identified the need to expand and upgrade our information systems to support recent and expected future growth. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations.
Any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track, record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could negatively impact our operations, shipment of goods, ability to process financial information and credit card
transactions, and our ability to receive and process e-commerce orders or engage in normal business activities. Moreover, security breaches or leaks of proprietary information, including leaks of customers’ private data, could result in
liability, decrease customer confidence in our company, and weaken our ability to compete in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Our e-commerce operations are increasingly important to our business. The Ulta.com website serves as an effective extension of Ulta’s marketing and
prospecting strategies (beyond catalogs, newspaper inserts and national advertising) by exposing potential new customers to the Ulta brand, product offerings, and enhanced content. As the importance of our website and e-commerce operations to our
business grows, we are increasingly vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce e-commerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation.

We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology
systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We rely on information technology systems across our operations,
including for management, supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and capacity of these systems. Information technology
system failures, network disruptions or breaches of security could disrupt our operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders or impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing of transactions or reporting of financial
results. An attack or other problem with our systems could also result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning our customers or employees, which could result in significant damage to our
business and our reputation.



Cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to
liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store
sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure
processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error,
malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal
claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our business, products and services, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. We employ IT security and security-related products and services as well as a full-time staff to proactively monitor our systems and networks. We maintain continual vigilance in
regard to the protection of sensitive information and are in compliance with all applicable data protection laws and regulations.

Unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer, associate or company information could damage our reputation, expose us to litigation and
negatively impact our business.

We collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associate information as part
of our normal course of business. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our
systems and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events. Any security breach of customer, associate or company
confidential information could result in damage to our reputation and result in lost sales, litigation, fines, or additional investments to fix or replace the systems that were breached. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Our e-commerce business may be unsuccessful.

We offer many of our beauty products for sale through our website. As a result, we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by
internet-based businesses, including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a cost-effective basis and our ability to operate, support, expand and develop our internet operations, website and software and other related
operational systems. Although we believe that our participation in both e-commerce and physical store sales is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers, supporting product offerings through both of these
channels could create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations. For example, if our e-commerce business successfully grows, it may do so in part by attracting existing customers, rather than new customers, who
choose to purchase products from us online rather than from our physical stores, thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores. In addition, offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our
current or potential internet customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products. In addition, offering products through our internet channel could cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet offerings
of their products either on their own or through competing distributors. As we continue to grow our e-commerce business, the impact of attracting existing rather than new customers, of conflicts between product offerings online and through our
stores, and of opening up our channels to increased internet competition could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows, including future growth.

Increased costs or interruption in our third-party vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production, shipment or receipt of some
of our merchandise, which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs.

We directly source the majority of our
gift-with-purchase and other promotional products through third-party vendors using foreign factories. In addition, many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products. Any event causing a sudden
disruption of manufacturing or imports



from such foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions, unanticipated political changes, increased customs duties, legal or economic restrictions on overseas
suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products, and natural disasters, could materially harm our operations. We have no long-term supply contracts with respect to such foreign-sourced items, many of which are subject to existing or
potential duties, tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the United States from such countries. Our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing
goods from abroad, such as political instability, disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices. Our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise
is produced, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or terrorism in the United States or worldwide, to the extent these acts affect the production, shipment or receipt of merchandise. Our future
operations and performance will be subject to these factors, which are beyond our control, and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows or may require us to modify our
current business practices and incur increased costs.

A reduction in traffic to, or the closing of, the other destination retailers in
the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with unsold inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

As a result of our real estate strategy, most of our stores are located in off-mall shopping areas known as power centers. Power
centers typically contain three to five big-box anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants. As a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas, our sales are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic
generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located. Customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores, or by
a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn, a general downturn in the local area where our store is located, or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center.
Such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may respond by increasing markdowns or
initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which would further decrease our gross profits and net income. This risk is more pronounced during the recent economic downturn which has resulted in a number of national retailers filing
for bankruptcy or closing stores due to depressed consumer spending levels.

Diversion of exclusive salon products, or a decision by
manufacturers of exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels, could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and
cash flows.

The retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized
professional retail outlets. However, incidents of product diversion occur, which involve the selling of salon exclusive haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores, grocery stores or mass merchandisers. Diversion could result in
adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our products (if diverted products are old, tainted or damaged), as well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to purchase diverted product from these channels rather than
purchasing from one of our salons. Additionally, the various product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize other distribution channels for such products, therefore widening the availability of these products in other retail channels,
which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products.

We rely on our good relationships with vendors to
purchase prestige, mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms. If these relationships were to be impaired, or if certain vendors were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our
growth plans, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms, and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products, either of which could have a material adverse effect on
our competitive position, business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

We have no long-term supply agreements or
exclusive arrangements with vendors and, therefore, our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our vendors. Our business depends to a significant extent on the



willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores. Some of our prestige vendors may not have the capacity to supply us
with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans. We also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands, which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands. Any of our other core brands could in the
future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors, which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products. If we fail to maintain strong relationships with our
existing vendors, or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional vendors of beauty products, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited, which could have a
negative impact on our competitive position.

During fiscal 2013, merchandise supplied to Ulta by our top ten vendors accounted for
approximately 51% of our net sales. There continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry. The loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors, or by any of our other
vendors, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

If we are unable to protect
our intellectual property rights, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

We regard our trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. Our principal
intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on our name, “Ulta,” and other marks incorporating that name, copyrights in our website content, rights to our domain name www.ulta.com and trade secrets and
know-how with respect to our Ulta branded product formulations, product sourcing, sales and marketing and other aspects of our business. As such, we rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with
certain of our employees, consultants, suppliers and others to protect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other proprietary rights for any reason, or if other
parties infringe on our intellectual property rights, our brand and reputation could be impaired and we could lose customers.

If our
manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for Ulta, including Ulta branded products and gift-with-purchase and other promotional products, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements, we could suffer lost sales and be
required to take costly corrective action, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third-party vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for Ulta, including Ulta branded
products and gift-with-purchase and other promotional products. Our third-party manufacturers of Ulta products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are
consistent with applicable regulatory requirements. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be required to take costly corrective action. In addition, sanctions under various laws may
include seizure of products, injunctions against future shipment of products, restitution and disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. The FDA does not have a pre-market approval system for cosmetics, and we believe
we are permitted to market our cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety or efficacy data to the FDA. However, cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future. These events could interrupt the
marketing and sale of our Ulta products, severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace, increase the cost of our products, cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in
sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores, any of which could result in lost sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

We, as well as our vendors, are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased
costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

In our U.S.
markets, numerous laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels can affect our business. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate



cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. If we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, a
prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on the sale of our Ulta branded products. In particular, failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, profitability and cash flows:

In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education and Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Acts”) was passed and signed into law. This healthcare reform legislation significantly expands healthcare coverage to many
uninsured individuals and to those already insured. Due to the breadth and complexity of the healthcare reform legislation and the staggered implementation and uncertain timing of the regulations and lack of interpretive guidance, it is difficult to
predict the overall impact of the healthcare reform legislation on our business over the coming years. Possible adverse effects include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we conduct
business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has imposed new mandates on employers, including a requirement effective January 1, 2014 (which has been extended to January 1, 2015 due to a recent executive order)
that employers with 50 or more full-time employees provide “credible” health insurance to employees or pay a financial penalty. Given our current health plan design, and assuming the law is implemented without significant changes, these
mandates could materially increase our costs. Moreover, if we choose to opt out of offering health insurance to our employees, we may become less attractive as an employer and it may be harder for us to compete for qualified employees. Additionally,
because significant provisions of the Acts will become effective on various dates over the next several years, future changes could significantly impact any effects on our business that we previously anticipated.

Ÿ

Our rapidly expanding workforce, growing in pace with our number of stores, makes us vulnerable to changes in labor and employment laws. In addition,
changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs, which could hurt our profitability and affect our growth strategy.

Ÿ

Our salon business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements for our stylists and our salon procedures. Failure to
maintain compliance with these regulatory and licensing requirements could jeopardize the viability of our salons.

Ÿ

We operate stores in California, which has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “Proposition 65” requiring that “clear and
reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. Although we have sought to comply with Proposition 65 requirements, there can be no assurance
that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65.

In addition, the formulation,
manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our vendors’ products and our Ulta products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC and state attorneys general in the
United States. If we, our vendors or the manufacturers of our Ulta products fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our
business. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’
products or our Ulta products, resulting in significant loss of net sales. Our failure to comply with FTC or state regulations that cover our vendors’ products or our Ulta product claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising
by us, may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products.



As we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states, we are subject to local building codes
in an increasing number of local jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with local building codes, and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy in a timely manner, could cause delays in our new store openings, which could
increase our store opening costs, cause us to incur lost sales and profits, and damage our public reputation.

Ensuring compliance with
local zoning and real estate land use restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities and states. Our store leases generally require us to provide a certificate of occupancy
with respect to the interior build-out of our stores (landlords generally provide the certificate of occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger shopping area and common areas), and while we strive to remain in compliance with
local building codes relating to the interior build out of our stores, the constantly increasing number of local jurisdictions in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of changes in, and requirements of, local building
codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes. Moreover, our landlords have occasionally been unable, due to the requirements of local zoning laws, to obtain in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy
with respect to the shell of our stores and/or the larger shopping centers and/or common areas (which certificate of occupancy is required by local building codes for us to open our store), causing us in some instances to delay store openings. As
the number of local building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which we and our landlords are subject to increases, we may be increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and delays in store openings caused by our or our
landlords’ compliance with local building codes and local building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes, which increased construction costs and/or delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs,
cause us to incur lost sales and profits, and damage our public reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Our Ulta products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits, either of which could result in unexpected
costs and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our Ulta products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings, or salon services which may have been performed negligently, could result in
the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services. Such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence
lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our
capital resources. Further, we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment, in which case our creditors could levy against our assets. These events could cause negative publicity regarding our company, brand or products, which could
in turn harm our reputation and net sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Legal proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business operations,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Our technologies,
promotional products purchased from third-party vendors, or Ulta products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents, patent applications, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the
United States and abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a third party were to bring an intellectual
property infringement suit against us, we could be forced to stop or delay development, manufacturing, or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit.

As a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party and would most likely be required to
pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Ultimately, we could be



prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims, we are
unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. The inability to enter into licenses could harm
our business significantly.

In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent or trademark litigation and
other proceedings, including interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) proceedings before the USPTO’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office,
regarding intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased from third-party vendors or our Ulta branded products and technology. Some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings better than us
because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. Intellectual
property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Increases in the demand for, or the price of, raw materials used to build and remodel our stores could hurt our profitability.

The raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions,
government regulations, general economic conditions and other unpredictable factors. As a retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program, we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and remodeling costs. As a result,
increases in the demand for, or the price of, raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. We expect the net investment to open a new store in 2014 to increase due to
increases in material and labor costs resulting from a stronger commercial and residential building environment compared to the last several years.

Increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing will affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings, which will reduce our profitability.

Postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog and promotional mailings. In response to any future increases in mailing
costs, we may consider reducing the number and size of certain catalog editions. In addition, we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes. We are not a
party to any long-term contracts for the supply of paper. The cost of paper fluctuates significantly, and our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces that we cannot control. Future additional increases in postal rates or in paper
or printing costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Our secured
revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to open stores.

We have a $200 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in December 2018. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement.
Outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or Libor plus 1.50% and the unused line fee is 0.20%. The credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our
business. These covenants, among other things, limit our ability to grant liens on our assets, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem our stock, enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another
entity. These covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and, in certain circumstances, may allow the
lenders thereunder to require repayment.



We may need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy, and we may be unable to raise
capital when needed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

From time to time we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for capital expenditures and working capital consistent with our growth
strategy. In addition, if general economic, financial or political conditions in our markets change, or if other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow, the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as our belief as to
the adequacy of our available sources of capital could change significantly. Any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs, requiring us to raise additional capital to meet those needs. If financing is not
available on satisfactory terms or at all, we may be unable to execute our growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may suffer.

Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our
ability to manage our expenses.

Reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth are likely to place a strain on
our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel. In addition, as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can periodically certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, we have been required to improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting
systems and procedures and have incurred and will continue to incur expenses to test our systems and to make such improvements. If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public
accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public
confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial
performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.

The
market price for our common stock may be volatile, and an investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all.

The market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate significantly from time to time in response to factors including:

Ÿ

differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors;

Ÿ

fluctuations in quarterly operating results;

Ÿ

our performance during peak retail seasons such as the holiday season;

Ÿ

market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole;

Ÿ

changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by any research analysts that follow our stock or any failure to
meet the estimates made by research analysts;

Ÿ

investors’ perceptions of our prospects and the prospects of the beauty products and salon services industries;

Ÿ

the performance of our key vendors;

Ÿ

announcements by us, our vendors or our competitors of significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital
commitments;

Ÿ

introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us or by our competitors;

Ÿ

stock transactions by our principal stockholders;

Ÿ

recruitment or departure of key personnel; and

Ÿ

the level and quality of securities research analyst coverage for our common stock.



In addition, public announcements by our competitors, other retailers and vendors concerning, among other
things, their performance, strategy, or accounting practices could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance.

Use of social media may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties.

There has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications, which allow individuals access to a
broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business. Customers
value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.

We also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest accounts. As laws and regulations rapidly
evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our
business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows, or subject us to fines or other penalties.

Anti-takeover provisions in our
organizational documents, stockholder rights agreement and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the Company would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent
attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
by-laws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of
our common stock. These provisions include:

Ÿ

dividing our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;

Ÿ

authorizing our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and additional shares of our common stock without stockholder approval;

Ÿ

prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent;

Ÿ

prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders;

Ÿ

prohibiting our stockholders from making certain changes to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws except
with a two-thirds majority stockholder approval; and

Ÿ

requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at stockholders’ meetings.

As permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, we have a stockholder rights agreement, sometimes known as a
“poison pill,” which provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common stock. In the event of a takeover attempt, this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock other than the acquirer to buy
additional shares of common stock at a discount, leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s stake.

We are also subject to provisions of
Delaware law that, in general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15% stockholder, subject to specified exceptions. Together, these provisions
of our certificate of incorporation,

by-laws

and stockholder rights agreement and of Delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could
involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.



Litigation costs and the outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business
and any loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses.

From time to time we may be subject to litigation claims
through the ordinary course of our business operations regarding, but not limited to, employment matters, security of consumer and employee personal information, contractual relations with suppliers, marketing and infringement of trademarks and
other intellectual property rights. Litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties, may be necessary, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our
resources, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. We establish accruals for potential liability arising from legal proceedings when potential liability is probable and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability. In addition, actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter, or
in the aggregate. An unfavorable resolution of a legal proceeding or claim could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

Management does not believe the nature of any pending legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. However, management’s
assessment may change at any time based upon the discovery of facts or circumstances that are presently not known to us. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.

There can be no assurance that we will declare dividends in the future.

We paid a special cash dividend on May 15, 2012. Any future dividend payments will be within the discretion of our Board of
Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, contractual restrictions, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other
factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We may not have sufficient liquidity in the future to pay dividends on our common stock.

Our previously announced stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in
the trading price of our common stock.

On March 18, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock
repurchase program. Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, at prices that the Company deems appropriate and subject to
market conditions, applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the Company’s sole discretion, up to an aggregate purchase price of $150 million. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including
the timing of open trading windows, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market conditions. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock, and may be suspended or
discontinued at any time and any suspension or discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a
stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will
enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term
stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness.

Legal Proceedings

.

General litigation —

On March 2, 2012, a putative employment class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain unnamed defendants in state court in Los Angeles County,
California. On April 12, 2012, the Company removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On August 8, 2013, the plaintiff asked the court to certify the proposed class and the Company opposed
the plaintiff’s request and is waiting for the court to issue a decision. The plaintiff and members of the proposed class are alleged to be (or to have been) non-exempt hourly employees. The suit alleges that Ulta violated various provisions of
the California labor laws and failed to provide plaintiff and members of the proposed class with full meal periods, paid rest breaks, certain wages, overtime compensation and premium pay. The suit seeks to recover damages and penalties as a result
of these alleged practices. The Company denies plaintiff’s allegations and is vigorously defending the matter.

We are also involved in
various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any liability with respect to these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market Information

Our common stock has
traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “Ulta” since October 25, 2007. Our initial public offering was priced at $18.00 per share. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock on
the NASDAQ Global Select Market during fiscal years 2013 and 2012:

Holders of the Registrant’s Common Stock

The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on March 27, 2014 was $98.75 per share. As of March 27, 2014, we had 56 holders of record of our common stock.
Because many shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

Dividends

On March 8, 2012,
we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a $1.00 per share special cash dividend to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 20, 2012. The special cash dividend, totaling $62.5 million, was paid on May 15,
2012.

Our Board of Directors may determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital
requirements, current and future liquidity, restrictions as part of our credit facility as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

On
March 18, 2013, we announced the approval of a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of the Company’s common stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or
otherwise, at prices that the Company deems appropriate and subject to market conditions, applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the Company’s sole discretion. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may
be suspended or discontinued at any time. No repurchases of our common stock were completed during the fourth quarter of 2013. As of February 1, 2014, $112.7 million remained available under the $150 million program.

Overview

We were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels – department stores
for prestige products, drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products, and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept by combining one-stop shopping, a compelling
value proposition, convenient locations



and a welcoming shopping environment. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance.

We are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides one-stop shopping for prestige, mass and salon products and salon services in the United
States. We focus on providing affordable indulgence to our customers by combining unmatched product breadth, value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer. Key aspects of our business include our
ability to offer our customers a broad selection of more than 20,000 beauty products across the categories of cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products and salon styling tools, as well as salon haircare products. We focus on
delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories. Our stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power centers.

The continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our five
point growth strategy, including growing stores to approximately 1,200 locations, expanding our offering by adding new products, brands and services, enhancing our loyalty program, broadening our marketing reach and expanding our digital business.
We believe that the expanding U.S. beauty products and salon services industry, the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores, coupled with Ulta’s competitive strengths, positions us to
capture additional market share in the industry through successful execution of our growth strategy.

Comparable store sales is a key metric
that is monitored closely within the retail industry. Our comparable store sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable store sales, including general U.S.
economic conditions, changes in merchandise strategy or mix, and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, among others.

Over the
long-term, our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by opening new stores. Operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage
our fixed store costs with comparable store sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people, systems and supply chain required to support a 1,200 store chain with a successful e-commerce business and
competitive omni-channel capabilities. We are currently evaluating our long range strategic and financial plan and expect to share our long-term growth plan and financial targets in the fall of 2014.

Global economic conditions

Economic
conditions in the U.S. continue to be uneven. Fiscal stress in Europe and economic uncertainty in the U.S. related to deficit issues, potential tax increases and federal spending cuts have resulted in significant fluctuations in the financial
markets. While the U.S. credit markets have stabilized and credit availability has improved compared to the recent recessionary period, economic growth is expected to continue to be weak. Consumer spending habits are affected by levels of
unemployment, unsettled financial markets, weakness in housing and real estate, higher interest rates, fuel and energy costs, and consumer perception of economic conditions, among others. Sudden negative changes in one or more of the factors that
affect consumer spending could adversely affect consumer spending levels which could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and adversely affect our sales levels and financial performance.

Basis of presentation

We have
determined the operating segments on the same basis that we use to internally evaluate performance. We have combined our three operating segments: retail stores, salon services and e-commerce, into one reportable segment because they have a similar
class of consumer, economic characteristics, nature of products and distribution methods.

Net sales include store and e-commerce merchandise
sales as well as salon service revenue. We recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores and e-commerce sales are recorded based on delivery of merchandise to the customer. Merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated
returns. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales.



Comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of
operation. Therefore, a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have
not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity. Remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a
portion of the current or prior period. Beginning with the first quarter of 2013, comparable store sales include the Company’s e-commerce business. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers
calculate comparable or same store sales.

Measuring comparable store sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as
several other aspects of our overall strategy. Several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales results:

Ÿ

the general national, regional and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels;

Ÿ

the introduction of new products or brands;

Ÿ

the location of new stores in existing store markets;

Ÿ

competition;

Ÿ

our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences;

Ÿ

the effectiveness of our various marketing activities; and

Ÿ

the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores.

Cost of sales includes:

Ÿ

the cost of merchandise sold, including substantially all vendor allowances, which are treated as a reduction of merchandise costs;

Ÿ

warehousing and distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities,
and insurance;

Ÿ

store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, licenses, and
cleaning expenses;

Ÿ

salon payroll and benefits;

Ÿ

customer loyalty program expense; and

Ÿ

shrink and inventory valuation reserves.

Our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an increasing number of stores. Changes in our merchandise mix may also have an impact on cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost
of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses include:

Ÿ

payroll, bonus and benefit costs for retail and corporate employees;

Ÿ

advertising and marketing costs;

Ÿ

occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities;

Ÿ

stock-based compensation expense;

Ÿ

depreciation and amortization for all assets except those related to our retail and warehouse operations, which is included in cost of sales; and

Ÿ

legal, finance, information systems and other corporate overhead costs.



This presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way
in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses.

Pre-opening expense includes
non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and grand
opening advertising.

Interest expense includes interest costs and unused facility fees associated with our credit facility, which is
structured as an asset based lending instrument. Our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates.

Income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores.

Results of operations

Our
fiscal years are the 52 or 53 week periods ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The Company’s fiscal years ended February 1, 2014, February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012 were 52, 53 and 52 week years,
respectively, and are hereafter referred to as fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011.

As of February 1, 2014, we operated 675 stores
across 46 states. The following tables present the components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:



Fiscal year 2013 versus fiscal year 2012

Net sales

Net sales increased $450.3 million, or 20.3%, to $2,670.6 million in
fiscal 2013 compared to $2,220.3 million in fiscal 2012. Salon service sales increased $24.4 million, or 20.1% to $145.8 million compared to $121.4 million in fiscal 2012. E-commerce sales increased $40.7 million, or 73.9%, to $95.8 million compared
to $55.1 million in fiscal 2012. The net sales increases are due to the opening of 125 net new stores in 2013 and a 7.9% increase in comparable store sales. Non-comparable stores, which include stores opened in fiscal 2013 as well as stores opened
in fiscal 2012 which have not yet turned comparable, contributed $283.0 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed $167.3 million of the total net sales increase. The sales for the 53rd week of fiscal 2012 were
approximately $55 million.

The 7.9% comparable store sales increase consisted of a 6.1% increase at the Company’s retail and salon
stores and a 76.6% increase in the Company’s e-commerce business. The inclusion of the e-commerce business resulted in an increase of approximately 180 basis points to the Company’s consolidated same store sales calculation for fiscal 2013
compared to 50 basis points for fiscal 2012. The total comparable store sales increase included a 6.9% increase in average ticket and a 1.0% increase in traffic. We attribute the increase in comparable store sales to our successful marketing and
merchandising strategies.

Gross profit

Gross profit increased $157.5 million, or 20.1%, to $941.2 million in fiscal 2013, compared to $783.7 million, in fiscal 2012. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points to 35.2%
in fiscal 2013 compared to 35.3% in fiscal 2012. The decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by:

Ÿ

40 basis points deleverage in merchandise margins due mainly to changes in marketing and merchandising strategies; offset by

Ÿ

20 basis point leverage in supply chain due to operating efficiencies; and

Ÿ

10 basis points of leverage in fixed store costs attributed to the impact of higher sales levels in fiscal 2013.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $107.5 million, or 22.0%, to $596.4 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $488.9 million in fiscal 2012. As a percentage of net sales,
SG&A expenses increased 30 basis points to 22.3% in fiscal 2013 compared to 22.0% in fiscal 2012. The 30 basis point deleverage in SG&A expense was primarily driven by the planned investments in supply chain, e-commerce and store labor
to support rapid growth.



Pre-opening expenses

Pre-opening expenses increased $2.5 million, or 16.6%, to $17.3 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $14.8 million in fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2013, we opened 127 new stores, remodeled 7 stores and
relocated 4 stores. During fiscal 2012, we opened 102 new stores and remodeled 21 stores and relocated 3 stores.

Interest income and
expense

Interest income was $0.1 million in fiscal 2013 and interest expense was $0.2 million in fiscal 2012. Interest income results
from highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense represents various fees related to the credit facility. We did not utilize our credit facility during fiscal 2013 or 2012.

Income tax expense

Income tax
expense of $124.9 million in fiscal 2013 represents an effective tax rate of 38.1%, compared to fiscal 2012 tax expense of $107.2 million and an effective tax rate of 38.3%. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2013 is primarily due to a decrease in state
taxes compared to fiscal 2012.

Net income

Net income increased $30.3 million, or 17.6%, to $202.8 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $172.5 million in fiscal 2012. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of
$157.5 million, which was offset by a $107.5 million increase in SG&A expenses and a $17.7 million increase in income tax expense.

Fiscal year 2012 versus fiscal year 2011

Net sales

Net sales increased
$444.1 million, or 25.0%, to $2,220.3 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $1,776.2 million in fiscal 2011. Salon service sales increased $22.9 million, or 23.2% to $121.4 million compared to $98.5 million in fiscal 2011. The sales increases are due
to the opening of 101 net new stores in 2012 and a 8.8% increase in comparable store sales which was primarily due to a 6.5% increase in store traffic. Non-comparable stores, which include stores opened in fiscal 2012 as well as stores opened in
fiscal 2011 which have not yet turned comparable, contributed $291.0 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed $153.1 million of the total net sales increase. We attribute the increase in comparable store sales to
our successful marketing and merchandise strategies. The sales for the 53rd week of fiscal 2012 were approximately $55 million.

Gross profit

Gross profit
increased $166.9 million, or 27.0%, to $783.7 million in fiscal 2012, compared to $616.8 million, in fiscal 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 35.3% in fiscal 2012 compared to 34.7% in fiscal 2011. The
increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by:

Ÿ

50 basis points of leverage in fixed store costs attributed to the impact of higher sales levels in fiscal 2012; and

Ÿ

30 basis points improvement in merchandise margins driven by our marketing and merchandising strategies.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $78.2 million, or 19.0%, to $488.9 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $410.7 million in fiscal 2011. As a percentage of net sales,
SG&A expenses decreased 110 basis points to 22.0% in fiscal 2012 compared to 23.1% in fiscal 2011. The leverage in SG&A expense was primarily driven by:

Ÿ

70 basis points in corporate overhead leverage attributed to higher sales volume; and



Ÿ

40 basis points improvement in variable store and marketing expense leverage attributed to cost efficiencies and higher sales volume.

Pre-opening expenses

Pre-opening expenses increased $4.8 million, or 48.4%, to $14.8 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $10.0 million in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, we opened 102 new stores, remodeled 21 stores and
relocated 3 stores. During fiscal 2011, we opened 61 new stores and remodeled 17 stores and relocated 2 stores.

Interest expense

Interest expense was $0.2 million in fiscal 2012 and $0.6 million in fiscal 2011. Interest expense for both periods represents various
fees related to the credit facility. We did not utilize our credit facility during fiscal 2012 or 2011.

Income tax expense

Income tax expense of $107.2 million in fiscal 2012 represents an effective tax rate of 38.3%, compared to fiscal 2011 tax expense of
$75.3 million and an effective tax rate of 38.5%. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2012 is primarily due to a decrease in state taxes and less non-deductible executive compensation compared to fiscal 2011.

Net income

Net income increased
$52.2 million, or 43.5%, to $172.5 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $120.3 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $166.9 million, which was offset by a $78.2 million increase in
SG&A expenses and a $31.9 million increase in income tax expense.

Liquidity and capital resources

Our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new, relocated and remodeled stores, increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion,
supply chain improvements and for continued improvement in our information technology systems.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on
hand and cash flows from operations, including changes in working capital, and borrowings under our credit facility. The most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued
expenses. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day, or within several days of the related sale, while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors.

Our working capital needs are greatest from August through November each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for the approaching
holiday season. This is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements. Based on past performance and current
expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the Company’s working capital needs, capital expenditure needs, commitments, and other liquidity requirements
through at least the next 12 months.

The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011:



Operating activities

Operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation, realized gains or losses on disposal of property
and equipment, and the effect of working capital changes.

Merchandise inventories were $457.9 million at February 1, 2014, compared to
$361.1 million at February 2, 2013, representing an increase of $96.8 million or 26.8%. Average inventory per store increased 3.3% compared to prior year. The increase in inventory is primarily due to the following:

Ÿ

approximately $82 million due to the addition of 125 net new stores opened since February 2, 2013;

Ÿ

approximately $10 million related to new brand additions and existing brand extensions primarily in the prestige color and skin category; and

Ÿ

approximately $5 million related to the addition of in-store prestige boutiques.

We had a current tax liability of $15.3 million at the end of fiscal 2013 compared to $10.1 million at the end of fiscal 2012. The increase in taxes
payable is primarily due to an increase in taxable income.

Deferred rent liabilities were $261.6 million at February 1, 2014, an increase
of $53.6 million compared to the prior year end. Deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances, future rental increases and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straight-line basis over their respective lease term. The increase is
primarily due to the addition of 125 net new stores opened since February 2, 2013.

The $18.7 million cash flow benefit from income taxes
is attributed to Federal income tax deductions due to accelerated depreciation on fixed assets and tax deductible stock option exercises.

Investing activities

We have
historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores as well as investments in information technology systems. Investment activities for capital expenditures were $226.0 million in fiscal 2013, compared to $188.6 million and $128.6 million
in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to the increase in our 2013 new store program. During fiscal 2013 we opened 127 new stores, remodeled 7 stores and relocated 4 stores,
compared to 102 new stores, 21 remodels and 3 relocations during fiscal 2012 and 61 new stores, 17 remodels and 2 relocations during fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2013, the average investment required to open a new Ulta store was approximately $1.0
million, which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses and initial inventory net of payables. The average investment required to remodel an Ulta store was approximately $1.2 million.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 and planned fiscal 2014 by major category are as follows:

Our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new, relocated and remodeled stores, supply chain
investments and information technology systems that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures. Based on past performance and current expectations, we expect to self-fund future capital expenditures. We expect to spend approximately $265
million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2014. We expect to spend less on new, remodeled and relocated stores with our plan to open approximately 100 new stores and remodel approximately 12 stores in fiscal 2014 compared to 127 new stores and 17
remodels in fiscal 2013. This decrease



will be offset by expected increases in supply chain expenditures. We are embarking on a multi-year supply chain project beginning in 2014 which will include adding additional capacity, including
a fourth distribution center expected to open in 2015, and system improvements to support expanded omni-channel capabilities.

Financing
activities

Financing activities in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 consist principally of capital stock transactions and the related income tax
effects, a dividend payment and our stock repurchase program. Purchase of treasury shares in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 represents the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy
minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock.

We had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end
of fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011. The zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth, overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working
capital reductions. We may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program and seasonal inventory needs.

Dividend

On March 8, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a
$1.00 per share special cash dividend to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 20, 2012. The special cash dividend totaling $62.5 million was paid on May 15, 2012.

Our Board of Directors may determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and
future liquidity, restrictions included as part of our credit facility as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time.

Stock Repurchase Plan

On March 18,
2013, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $150 million of the Company’s common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time in the open
market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, at prices that the Company deems appropriate and subject to market conditions, applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the Company’s sole discretion. The stock repurchase
program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal 2013, we purchased 500,500 shares of common stock for $37.3 million at an average price of $74.58.

Credit facility

On October 19,
2011, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder, Wells Fargo Capital Finance LLC as a
Lender, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as a Lender, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a Lender and PNC Bank, National Association, as a Lender. The Loan Agreement amended and restated the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2010, by and
among the lenders. The Loan Agreement extends the maturity of the Company’s credit facility to October 2016, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $200,000 or a percentage of eligible owned inventory, contains a $10,000
subfacility for letters of credit and allows the Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $50,000, subject to consent by each lender and other conditions. The Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a minimum amount of
excess borrowing availability at all times.

On September 5, 2012, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Loan
and Security Agreement (the Amendment) with the lender group. The Amendment updated certain administrative terms and conditions and provides us greater flexibility to take certain corporate actions. There were no changes to the revolving loan
amounts available, interest rates, covenants or maturity date under terms of the Loan Agreement.

On December 6, 2013, we entered into
Amendment No. 2 to the Amended and restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Amendment) with the lender group. The Loan Amendment extends the maturity of the facility to December 2018. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are
pledged as collateral for outstanding



borrowings under the facility. Outstanding borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate or Libor plus 1.50% and the unused line fee is 0.20%.

As of February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, we had no borrowings outstanding under its credit facility and the Company was in compliance with
all terms and covenants of the agreement.

Seasonality

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser
extent, our business is also affected by Mothers’ Day as well as the “Back to School” season and Valentine’s Day. Any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, or operating results for the entire fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of
operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.

Impact of inflation and changing prices

Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation
in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these
increased costs. In addition, inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our debt.

Off-balance sheet arrangements

Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease obligations. We do not have any non-cancelable purchase commitments as of
February 1, 2014.

Contractual obligations

We lease retail stores, warehouses, corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2027. Our store leases generally have initial lease terms of
10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases. In addition to future minimum lease payments, most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize
straight-line over the term of the lease, including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable. For certain locations, we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent, which is amortized on a straight-line basis
as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease, including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable. While a number of our store leases include contingent rentals, contingent rent amounts are insignificant.

The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash
flows in future periods. The table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. The table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the
right to control the use of the property as of February 1, 2014:

Critical accounting policies and estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical
experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. A discussion of our more significant estimates follows.
Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Inventory valuation

Merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or
market value. Cost is determined using the weighted-average cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including co-op advertising, markdowns, and volume discounts. We record
valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future
demand, age of inventory, and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these
estimates.

Inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations. We record a shrink reserve
representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count. This estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends. Adjustments to
earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Vendor allowances

We deem a cash consideration received from a supplier to be a reduction
of the cost of products sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific, incremental, identifiable cost incurred by the Company in selling the vendor’s products. The majority of cash consideration received
by the Company is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold. Any portion of such cash consideration received that is
attributable to inventory on hand is reflected as a reduction of inventory. We consider the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors in order to determine the appropriate classification of amounts received in the
consolidated statements of income. We record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in net receivables at the amount we expect to collect.

Impairment of long-lived tangible assets

We review long-lived tangible assets whenever
events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows. Assets are reviewed at the store level, which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Significant estimates are used
in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair
value of the assets. We have not recorded an impairment charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Share-based compensation

We account for share-based compensation in
accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification

TM

(ASC) rules for stock compensation. Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized on a straight-line method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest.



We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model. During fiscal
2013 we made changes to update the valuation assumptions to Company specific information. These changes had no material impact on the calculation. For fiscal 2013 the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the ULTA Common
Shares. The risk free interest rate was based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option. The expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be
outstanding. For fiscal 2013, the expected life of options granted was derived from historical data on Ulta stock option exercises. Prior to 2013, we had limited historical data related to exercise behavior since our initial public offering on
October 30, 2007. As a result, we elected to use the shortcut approach to determine the expected life in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin on share-based payments and the expected volatility was based on the historical
volatility of a peer group of publicly-traded companies. Beginning in fiscal 2013, we introduced a forfeiture rate. Forfeitures of options are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of the Company’s stock option activity and
reduce the compensation expense recognized.

See notes to consolidated financial statements, “Summary of significant accounting policies
— Share-based compensation,” for disclosure related to the Company’s stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, “Share-based awards,” for
disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and
rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest rate sensitivity

We are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through
borrowing under our credit facility. Interest on our borrowings is based upon variable rates. We did not utilize the credit facility during fiscal 2013, 2012 or 2011.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures over Financial Reporting

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to the members of our
senior management and Board of Directors.

Based on management’s evaluation as of February 1, 2014, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in
our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. (the Company) as of February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the
three years in the period ended February 1, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. at February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2014,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) and our report dated April 2, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Ulta
Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.

We have audited Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of February 1, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (1992 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Ulta
Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in
the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2014, based on the COSO criteria.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. as of February 1, 2014 and February 2,
2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2014 and our report dated April 2, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(In thousands, except per share data)

1.    Business and basis of presentation

Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 9, 1990, to operate
specialty retail stores selling cosmetics, fragrance, haircare and skincare products, and related accessories and services. The stores also feature full-service salons. As of February 1, 2014, the Company operated 675 stores in 46 states. As
used in these notes and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Ulta” or the “Company” refer to Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiary, Ulta Inc. All amounts are stated in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts and number of stores.

The
Company has determined its operating segments on the same basis that it uses to internally evaluate performance. The Company has combined its three operating segments: retail stores, salon services and e-commerce, into one reportable segment because
they have a similar class of consumer, economic characteristics, nature of products and distribution methods.

2.    Summary of significant accounting policies

Fiscal year

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The Company’s fiscal years ended
February 1, 2014 (fiscal 2013), February 2, 2013 (fiscal 2012) and January 28, 2012 (fiscal 2011) were 52, 53 and 52 week years, respectively.

Consolidation

The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and unrealized profit were eliminated in consolidation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the accounting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of
purchase. Cash equivalents include amounts due from third-party credit card receivables because such amounts generally convert to cash within one to three days with little or no default risk.

Receivables

Receivables consist principally of amounts receivable from vendors and
landlord construction allowances earned but not yet received. These receivables are computed based on provisions of the vendor and lease agreements in place and the Company’s completed performance. The Company’s vendors are primarily
U.S.-based producers of consumer products and real estate developers and landlords. The Company does not require collateral on its receivables and does not accrue interest. Credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to the diversity of
vendors and landlords comprising the Company’s vendor base. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its vendors and evaluates the collectability of its receivables based on the length of time the receivable is past due and historical
experience. The receivable for vendor allowances was $30,591 and $28,236 as of February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively and the receivable for landlord allowances was $14,128 and $11,595 as of February 1, 2014 and
February 2, 2013, respectively. The allowance for doubtful receivables totaled $915 and $973 as of February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively.



Merchandise inventories

Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the weighted-average cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods. Inventory cost
also includes vendor allowances related to co-op advertising, markdowns, and volume discounts. The Company maintains reserves for lower of cost or market and shrinkage.

Fair value of financial instruments

The carrying value of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates their estimated fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments. The Company had no outstanding debt as of February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013.

Property and equipment

The
Company’s property and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. The Company’s assets are depreciated or amortized using the
straight-line method, over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the expected lease term as follows:

Equipment and fixtures

3 to 10 years

Leasehold improvements

10 years

Electronic equipment and software

3 to 5 years

The Company capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage in developing or obtaining internal use
software. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software.

The Company periodically evaluates whether changes have
occurred that would require revision of the remaining useful life of equipment and leasehold improvements or render them not recoverable. If such circumstances arise, the Company uses an estimate of the undiscounted sum of expected future operating
cash flows during their holding period to determine whether the long-lived assets are impaired. If the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, the resulting impairment charges to be recorded are calculated
based on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the fair value of such assets, with the fair value determined based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows.

Customer loyalty program

During fiscal 2013, the Company operated two loyalty
programs, ULTAmate Rewards and The Club at Ulta. The Club at Ulta is a certificate program offering customers reward certificates for free beauty products based on their level of purchases. Customers earn reward certificates to redeem
during specific promotional periods throughout the year. In early fiscal 2014 we converted the remaining The Club at Ulta loyalty customers to ULTAmate Rewards, a points-based program. ULTAmate Rewards enables customers to earn points based on
their purchases. Points earned are valid for one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell. The Company accrues the cost of anticipated redemptions related to these programs at the time of the initial purchase based on historical
experience. The accrued liability related to both of the loyalty programs at February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013 was $7,740 and $7,084 respectively. The cost of these programs, which was $27,588, $22,044 and $17,200 in fiscal 2013, 2012
and 2011, respectively, is included in cost of sales in the statements of income.

Deferred rent

Many of the Company’s operating leases contain predetermined fixed increases of the minimum rental rate during the lease. For these leases, the
Company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty, and records the difference between
the amounts charged to expense and the rent paid as deferred rent. The lease term commences on the earlier of the date when the Company becomes legally obligated for rent payments or the date the Company takes possession of the leased space.



As part of many lease agreements, the Company receives construction allowances from landlords for tenant
improvements. These leasehold improvements made by the Company are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term. The construction allowances are recorded as deferred rent and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense.

Revenue recognition

Net sales include merchandise sales and salon service revenue. Revenue from merchandise sales at stores is recognized at the time of sale, net of
estimated returns. The Company provides refunds for product returns within 60 days from the original purchase date. Salon revenue is recognized when services are rendered. Salon service revenue amounted to $145,815, $121,357 and $98,479 for fiscal
2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as the Company considers itself a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting
state sales tax.

E-commerce

sales are recorded based on delivery of merchandise to the customer. E-commerce revenue amounted to $95,809, $55,086 and $41,333 for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The Company’s gift card sales are deferred and recognized in net sales when the gift card is redeemed for product or services. The
Company’s gift cards do not expire and do not include service fees that decrease customer balances. The Company has maintained Company-specific, historical data related to its large pool of similar gift card transactions sold and redeemed over
a significant time frame. The Company recognizes gift card breakage to the extent there is no requirement for remitting balances to governmental agencies under unclaimed property laws. Gift card breakage is recognized over the same performance
period, and in the same proportion, that the Company’s data has demonstrated that gift cards are redeemed. Gift card breakage is recorded as a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in the statements of income. Deferred gift
card revenue was $16,439 and $13,364 at February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively, and is included in accrued liabilities – accrued customer liabilities (Note 5).

Vendor allowances

The Company receives allowances from vendors in the normal course
of business including advertising and markdown allowances, purchase volume discounts and rebates, and reimbursement for defective merchandise, and certain selling and display expenses. Substantially all vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction
of the vendor’s product cost and are recognized in cost of sales as the product is sold.

Advertising

Advertising expense consists principally of paper, print and distribution costs related to the Company’s advertising circulars. The Company expenses
the production and distribution costs related to its advertising circulars in the period the related promotional event occurs. Total advertising costs, exclusive of incentives from vendors and start-up advertising expense, amounted to $140,774,
$118,365 and $99,446 for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Advertising expense as a percentage of sales was 5.3%, 5.3% and 5.6% for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively Prepaid advertising costs included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets were $6,891 and $6,251 as of February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively.

Pre-opening expenses

Non-capital expenditures incurred prior to the grand opening of a new, remodeled or relocated store are charged against earnings as
incurred.

Cost of sales

Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold including a majority of vendor allowances, which are treated as a reduction of merchandise costs; warehousing and distribution costs including labor and
related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance; shipping and handling costs; store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and
maintenance, insurance, licenses, and cleaning expenses; salon payroll and benefits; customer loyalty program expense; and shrink and inventory valuation reserves.



Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses includes payroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail and corporate employees; advertising and marketing
costs; occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities; public company expense including Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expenses; stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization for all assets except those related to our retail
and warehouse operations which are included in cost of sales; and legal, finance, information systems and other corporate overhead costs.

Income taxes

Deferred income
taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The amounts reported were derived using the enacted
tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse.

Income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions are
recognized only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will
be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax positions are recorded in income tax expense.

Share-based compensation

Share-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized on a straight-line method over the
requisite service period for awards expected to vest. The Company recorded stock compensation expense of $16,003, $13,375 and $11,605 for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively (see Note 9, “Share-based awards”).

Insurance expense

The Company
has insurance programs with third party insurers for employee health, workers compensation and general liability, among others, to limit the Company’s liability exposure. The insurance programs are premium based and include retentions,
deductibles and stop loss coverage. Current stop loss coverage per claim is $150 for employee health claims, $100 for general liability claims and $250 for workers compensation claims. The Company makes collateral and premium payments during the
plan year and accrues expenses in the event additional premium is due from the Company based on actual claim results.

Net income per
common share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share includes dilutive common stock equivalents, using the treasury stock method (see Note 10, “Net income per common share”).



3.    Property and equipment

Property and equipment consist of the following:

The Company had no capitalized interest for fiscal 2013 and 2012 as a result of not utilizing the credit facility during
the year.

4.    Commitments and contingencies

Leases

— The Company leases retail stores, distribution and office facilities, and certain equipment. Original
non-cancelable lease terms range from three to ten years, and store leases generally contain renewal options for additional years. A number of the Company’s store leases provide for contingent rentals based upon sales. Contingent rent amounts
were insignificant in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011. Total rent expense under operating leases was $138,086, $115,755 and $94,175 for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases as of February 1,
2014, are as follows:

Included in the operating lease schedule above is $164,771 of minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open
in fiscal 2014.

General litigation

— On March 2, 2012, a putative employment class action lawsuit was filed against us and
certain unnamed defendants in state court in Los Angeles County, California. On April 12, 2012, the Company removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On August 8, 2013, the plaintiff asked
the court to certify the proposed class and the Company opposed the plaintiff’s request and is waiting for the court to issue a decision. The plaintiff and members of the proposed class are alleged to be (or to have been) non-exempt hourly
employees. The suit alleges that Ulta violated various provisions of the California labor laws and failed to provide plaintiff and members of the proposed class with full meal periods, paid rest breaks, certain wages, overtime compensation and
premium pay. The suit seeks to recover damages and penalties as a result of these alleged practices. The Company denies plaintiff’s allegations and is vigorously defending the matter.

The Company has not recorded any accruals for this matter because the Company’s potential liability for the matter is not probable and cannot be reasonably estimated based on currently available
information. The Company cannot determine a reasonable estimate of the maximum possible loss or range of loss for this matter



given that it is in the early stage of the litigation process and is subject to the inherent uncertainties of litigation (such as the strength of the Company’s legal defenses and the
availability of insurance recovery). Although the maximum amount of liability that may ultimately result from this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, management expects that this matter, when ultimately resolved, will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity. It is possible, however, that the ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in a particular
quarter or year if such resolution results in a significant liability for the Company.

The Company is also involved in various legal
proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any liability with respect to these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material.

5.    Accrued liabilities

Accrued liabilities consist of the following:

6.    Income taxes

The provision for income taxes consists of the following:

A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:



Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

At February 1, 2014, the Company had $402 credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes.

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the ASC rules for income taxes. The reserve for uncertain tax positions was $795
at February 1, 2014. The balance is the Company’s best estimate of the potential liability for uncertain tax positions. The increase in the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions relates to a current year
position. There was no reserve for uncertain tax positions at February 2, 2013. A reconciliation of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:

The Company acknowledges that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change in the next twelve months. However, it
does not expect the change to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. Income tax-related interest and penalties were insignificant for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011.

The Company files tax returns in the U.S. Federal and State jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal examinations by the Internal Revenue Services for the years before 2011 and,
this applies to examinations by the State authorities before 2009.

7.    Notes payable

On October 19, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder, Wells Fargo Capital Finance LLC as a Lender, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as a Lender, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a Lender and PNC Bank,
National Association, as a Lender. The Loan Agreement amended and restated the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2010, by and among the lenders. The Loan Agreement extends the maturity of the Company’s credit facility to
October 2016,



provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $200,000 or a percentage of eligible owned inventory, contains a $10,000 subfacility for letters of credit and allows the Company to
increase the revolving facility by an additional $50,000, subject to consent by each lender and other conditions. The Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a minimum amount of excess borrowing availability at all times.

On September 5, 2012, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Amendment) with the
lender group. The Amendment updated certain administrative terms and conditions and provides the Company greater flexibility to take certain corporate actions. There were no changes to the revolving loan amounts available, interest rates, covenants
or maturity date under terms of the Loan Agreement.

On December 6, 2013, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Amended and
restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Amendment) with the lender group. The Loan Amendment extends the maturity of the facility to December 2018. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding
borrowings under the facility. Outstanding borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate or Libor plus 1.50% and the unused line fee is 0.20%.

As of February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the Company was in
compliance with all terms and covenants of the agreement.

8.    Fair value measurements

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates their estimated fair values due
to the short maturities of these instruments.

Fair value is measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy, which are
described as follows:

a. Level 1 — observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

b. Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through
corroboration with observable market data.

c. Level 3 — unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data,
which would require the Company to develop its own assumptions.

As of February 1, 2014, the Company held financial liabilities of $3,678
related to its non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The liabilities have been categorized as Level 2 as they are based on third-party reported net asset values which are based primarily on quoted market prices of underlying assets of the funds
within the plan.

Equity Incentive Plans

The Company has had a number of equity incentive plans over the years. The plans were adopted in order to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial authority and to
provide additional incentive to employees, directors, and consultants to promote the success of the Company’s business. Incentive compensation was awarded under the Amended and Restated Restricted Stock Option Plan until April 2002 and under
the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan through July 2007, at which time the 2007 Incentive Award Plan was adopted. All of the plans generally provided for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, stock appreciation rights, and other types of awards to employees, consultants, and directors. Unless provided otherwise by the administrator of the plan, options vested over four years at the rate of 25% per year from the date of grant
and most must be exercised within ten years. Options were granted with the exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

2011 Incentive Award Plan

In June 2011, the Company adopted the 2011 Incentive
Award Plan (the 2011 Plan). The 2011 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock



appreciation rights, performance awards, dividend equivalent rights, stock payments, deferred stock and cash-based awards to employees, consultants, and directors. Following its adoption, awards
are only being made under the 2011 Plan, and no further awards will be made under any prior plan. As of February 1, 2014, the 2011 Plan reserves for the issuance upon grant or exercise of awards up to 4,691 shares of the Company’s common
stock.

The Company recorded stock compensation expense of $16,003, $13,375 and $11,605 for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash
received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $21,890, $31,530 and $27,639, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for equity compensation
arrangements was $4,812, $5,364 and $3,545 for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercise and restricted stock vesting of the share-based payment arrangements totaled
$18,169, $51,886 and $29,439, respectively, for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Employee stock options

The Company measures share-based compensation cost on the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognizes the expense on a straight-line
method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. The Company estimated the grant date fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model using the following weighted-average assumptions:

During fiscal 2013 the Company made changes to update the valuation assumptions to Company specific information. These
changes are reflected in the table above and had no material impact on the calculation. For fiscal 2013 the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the ULTA Common Shares. The risk free interest rate was based on the United
States Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option. The expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding. For fiscal 2013, the expected life of options
granted was derived from historical data on ULTA stock option exercises. Prior to 2013, we had limited historical data related to exercise behavior since our initial public offering on October 30, 2007. As a result, the Company elected to use
the shortcut approach to determine the expected life in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin on share-based payments and the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly-traded companies.
Beginning in fiscal 2013, the Company introduced a forfeiture rate. Forfeitures of options are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of the Company’s stock option activity and reduce the compensation expense recognized. The
Company does not currently pay a regular dividend. The dividend paid in May 2012 was a one-time special cash dividend.

The Company granted 302
stock options during fiscal 2013. The compensation cost that has been charged against income for stock option grants was $10,214, $11,967, and $9,731 for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of
options granted in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $34.31, $46.29 and $34.81, respectively. The total fair value of stock options issued that vested during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $10,544, $12,089 and $10,451, respectively. At
February 1, 2014, there was approximately $18,074 of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options. The unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two
years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $49,404, $138,291 and $86,030 in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

respectively. The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 1, 2014 was $85.71 per share.

Restricted stock awards

The Company issues restricted stock to certain employees
and its Board of Directors. Employee grants will generally cliff vest after 3 years and director grants will cliff vest within one year. The compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $5,789, $1,408 and $1,874, respectively.
Beginning in fiscal 2013, the Company introduced a forfeiture rate. Forfeitures of restricted stock awards are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of the Company’s restricted stock award activity and reduce the compensation
expense recognized. At February 1, 2014, unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards was $9,100. The unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.

10.     Net income per common share

The following is a reconciliation of net income and the number of shares of common stock used in the computation of net income per
basic and diluted share:

The denominator for diluted net income per common share for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 exclude 658, 533 and 621
employee options, respectively, due to their anti-dilutive effects.

11.     Employee benefit plans

The Company provides a 401(k) retirement plan covering all employees who qualify as to age and length of service. The plan is funded
through employee contributions and a Company match. In fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company match was 100% of the first 3.0%, 3.0% and 2.5%, respectively, of eligible compensation. For fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company match was
$3,532, $3,040 and $2,146, respectively.

On January 1, 2009, the Company established a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for
highly compensated employees whose contributions are limited under qualified defined contribution plans. Amounts contributed and deferred under the plan are credited or charged with the performance of investment options offered under the plan as
elected by the participants. In the event of bankruptcy, the assets of this plan are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors. The liability for compensation deferred under the Company’s plan included in other long-term liabilities
was $3,678 and 2,876 as of February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively. The Company manages the risk of changes in the fair value of the liability for deferred compensation by electing to match its liability under the plan with
investment vehicles that offset a substantial portion of its exposure. The cash value of the investment vehicles included in deferred compensation plan assets was $4,294 and $2,866 as of February 1, 2014 and



February 2, 2013, respectively. Total expense recorded under this plan is included in selling, general and administrative expenses and was insignificant during fiscal 2013 and 2012.

13.    Selected quarterly financial data (unaudited)

The following tables set forth the Company’s unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal 2013 and
fiscal 2012. The Company uses a 13 week (14 week in fourth quarter fiscal 2012) fiscal quarter ending on the last Saturday of the quarter.

The sum of the quarterly net income per common share may not equal the annual total due to quarterly changes in the
weighted average shares and share equivalents outstanding.

14.    Stock repurchase program

On March 18, 2013, the Company announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which
the Company may repurchase up to $150 million of the Company’s common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, at prices that the Company deems appropriate and
subject to market conditions, applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the Company’s sole discretion. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal 2013,
we purchased 500,500 shares of common stock for $37.3 million at an average price of $74.58.
