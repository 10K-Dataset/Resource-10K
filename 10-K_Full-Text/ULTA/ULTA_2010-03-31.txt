Part I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. is the largest
    beauty retailer that provides one-stop shopping for prestige,
    mass and salon products and salon services in the United States.
    We focus on providing affordable indulgence to our customers by
    combining the product breadth, value and convenience of a beauty
    superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a
    specialty retailer. Key aspects of our business include:

One-Stop Shopping.

Our customers can satisfy
    all of their beauty needs at Ulta. We offer a unique combination
    of over 21,000 prestige and mass beauty products organized by
    category in bright, open, self-service displays to encourage our
    customers to play, touch, test, learn and explore. We believe we
    offer the widest selection of categories across prestige and
    mass cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body
    products and salon styling tools. We also offer a full-service
    salon and a wide range of salon haircare products in all of our
    stores.

Our Value Proposition.

We believe our focus on
    delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers
    across all of our product categories is fundamental to our
    customer loyalty. For example, we run frequent promotions and
    gift coupons for our mass brands, gift-with-purchase offers and
    multi-product gift sets for our prestige brands, and a
    comprehensive customer loyalty program.

An Off-Mall Location.

We are conveniently
    located in high-traffic, primarily off-mall locations such as
    power centers and lifestyle centers with other destination
    retailers. Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square
    feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to
    our full-service salon. Our displays, store design and open
    layout allow us the flexibility to respond to consumer trends
    and changes in our merchandising strategy.


In addition to the fundamental elements of a beauty superstore,
    we strive to offer an uplifting shopping experience through what
    we refer to as “The Five E’s”: Escape, Education,
    Entertainment, Esthetics and Empowerment.

Escape.

We strive to offer our customers a
    timely escape from the stresses of daily life in a welcoming and
    approachable environment. Our customer can immerse herself in
    our extensive product selection, indulge herself in our hair or
    skin treatments, or discover new and exciting products in an
    interactive setting. We provide a shopping experience without
    the intimidating, commission-oriented and brand-dedicated sales
    approach that we believe is found in most department stores and
    with a level of service that we believe is typically unavailable
    in drug stores and mass merchandisers.

Education.

We staff our stores with a team of
    well-trained beauty consultants and professionally licensed
    estheticians and stylists whose mission is to educate, inform
    and advise our customers regarding their beauty needs. We also
    provide product education through demonstrations, in-store
    videos and informational displays. Our focus on educating our
    customer reinforces our authority as her primary resource for
    beauty products and our credibility as a provider of consistent,
    high- quality salon services. Our beauty consultants are trained
    to service customers across all prestige lines and within our
    prestige “boutiques” where customers can receive a
    makeover or skin analysis.

Entertainment.

The entertainment experience
    for our customer begins at home when she receives our catalogs.
    Our catalogs are designed to introduce our customers to our
    newest products and promotions and to be invitations to come to
    Ulta to play, touch, test, learn and explore. A significant
    percentage of our sales throughout the year is derived from new
    products, making every visit to Ulta an opportunity to discover
    something new and exciting. In addition to providing over 4,500
    testers in categories such as fragrance, cosmetics, skincare,
    and salon styling tools, we further enhance the shopping
    experience and store atmosphere through live demonstrations from
    our licensed salon professionals and beauty consultants, and
    through customer makeovers and in-store videos.

Esthetics.

We strive to create a visually
    pleasing and inviting store and salon environment that
    exemplifies and reinforces the quality of our products and
    services. Our stores are brightly lit, spacious and attractive
    on the inside and outside of the store. Our store and salon
    design features sleek, modern lines that reinforce our status as
    a fashion authority, together with wide aisles that make the
    store easy to navigate and pleasant lighting to create a
    luxurious and welcoming environment. This strategy enables us to
    provide an extensive product selection in a well-organized store
    and to offer a salon experience that is both fashionable and
    contemporary.

Empowerment.

We are committed to creating an
    environment in which women feel empowered by both their inner
    and outer beauty; we take honor in providing our guests with
    opportunities to showcase how they have empowered themselves and
    others. Ulta is committed to positively impacting the lives of
    women through our work on two empowerment initiatives. The first
    is the Ulta Enrich, Empower and Enlighten Scholarship Fund which
    grants deserving high school senior girls scholarships to the
    educational institution of their choice. The second is our
    annual Windows of Love campaign that recognizes the “unsung
    heroes” who are affected by breast cancer. It is our hope
    that through these stories of empowerment women everywhere
    become one step closer to achieving their dreams and positively
    impacting others.

We were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time
    when prestige, mass and salon products were sold through
    distinct channels — department stores for prestige
    products, drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products,
    and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair
    care products. When Lyn Kirby, our current President and Chief
    Executive Officer, joined us in December 1999, we embarked on a
    multi-year strategy to understand and embrace what women want in
    a beauty retailer and transform Ulta into the shopping
    experience that it is today. We conducted extensive research and
    surveys to analyze customer response and our effectiveness in
    areas such as in-store experience, merchandise selection, salon
    services and marketing strategies. Based on our research and
    customer surveys, we pioneered what we believe to be a unique
    retail approach that focuses on all aspects of how women prefer
    to shop for beauty products by combining the fundamental
    elements of a beauty superstore, including one-stop shopping, a
    compelling value proposition and convenient locations, together
    with an uplifting specialty retail experience through our


emphasis on “The Five E’s”. While we are
    currently executing on the core elements of our business
    strategy, we plan to continually refine our approach in order to
    further enhance the shopping experience for our customers.

Our
    competitive strengths

We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us
    from our competitors and are critical to our continuing success:

Differentiated merchandising strategy with broad
    appeal.

We believe our broad selection of
    merchandise across categories, price points and brands offers a
    unique shopping experience for our customers. While the products
    we sell can be found in department stores, specialty stores,
    salons, drug stores and mass merchandisers, we offer all of
    these products in one retail format so that our customer can
    find everything she needs in one shopping trip. We appeal to a
    wide range of customers by offering over 500 brands, such as
    Bare Escentuals cosmetics, Chanel and Estée Lauder
    fragrances, L’Oréal haircare and cosmetics and Paul
    Mitchell haircare. We also have private label Ulta offerings in
    key categories. Because our offerings span a broad array of
    product categories in prestige, mass and salon, we appeal to a
    wide range of customers including women of all ages,
    demographics, and lifestyles.

Our unique customer experience.

We combine the
    value and convenience of a beauty superstore with the
    distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer.
    The “Five E’s” provide the foundation for our
    operating strategy. We cater to the woman who loves to indulge
    in shopping for beauty products as well as the woman who is time
    constrained and comes to the store knowing exactly what she
    wants. Our distribution infrastructure consistently delivers a
    greater than 95% in-stock rate, so our customers know they will
    find the products they are looking for. Our well-trained beauty
    consultants are not commission-based or brand-dedicated and
    therefore can provide unbiased and customized advice tailored to
    our customers’ needs. Together with our customer service
    strategy, our store locations, layout and design help create our
    unique retail shopping experience, which we believe increases
    both the frequency and length of our customers’ visits.

Retail format poised to benefit from shifting channel
    dynamics.

Over the past several years, the
    approximately $80 billion beauty products and salon
    services industry has experienced significant changes, including
    a shift in how manufacturers distribute and customers purchase
    beauty products. This has enabled the specialty retail channel
    in which we operate to grow at a greater rate than the industry
    overall since at least 2000. We are capitalizing on these trends
    by offering a primarily off-mall, service-oriented specialty
    retail concept with a comprehensive product mix across
    categories and price points.

Loyal and active customer base.

We have
    approximately seven million customer loyalty program members,
    the majority of whom have shopped at one of our stores within
    the past 12 months. We utilize this valuable proprietary
    database to drive traffic, better understand our customers’
    purchasing patterns and support new store site selection. We
    regularly distribute catalogs and newspaper inserts to entertain
    and educate our customers and, most importantly, to drive
    traffic to our stores.

Strong vendor relationships across product
    categories.

We have strong, active relationships
    with over 300 vendors, including Estée Lauder, Bare
    Escentuals, Coty, L’Oréal and Procter &
    Gamble. We believe the scope and extent of these relationships,
    which span the three distinct beauty categories of prestige,
    mass and salon and have taken years to develop, create a
    significant impediment for other retailers to replicate our
    model. These relationships also frequently afford us the
    opportunity to work closely with our vendors to market both new
    and existing brands in a collaborative manner.

Experienced management team.

We have an
    experienced senior management team with extensive beauty and
    retail experience that brings a creative merchandising approach
    and a disciplined operating philosophy to our business. Our
    senior management team is led by Lyn Kirby, our President and
    Chief Executive Officer, and Gregg Bodnar, our Chief Financial
    Officer. Additionally, over the past several years, we have
    significantly expanded the depth of our management team at all
    levels and in all functional areas to support our growth
    strategy.


Growth
    strategy

We intend to expand our presence as a leading retailer of beauty
    products and salon services by:

Growing our store base.

We opened 37 stores,
    representing square footage growth of 12%, and remodeled 6
    stores in fiscal 2009. Due to the economic downturn, the number
    of high-quality commercial real estate projects of the size and
    with the co-tenant mix that we typically target for our new
    store locations has significantly declined. As a result, we
    reduced our new store program for 2009.

As the economy stabilizes and begins to recover, we believe our
    successful track record of opening new stores in diverse markets
    across the United States will allow us to increase our new store
    growth rates back to historical levels consistent with our
    long-term target of 15% to 20%. We continue to believe that over
    the long-term, we have the potential to grow our store base to
    over 1,000 Ulta stores in the United States. Our internal real
    estate model takes into account a number of variables, including
    demographic and sociographic data as well as population density
    relative to maximum drive times, economic and competitive
    factors. We plan to continue opening stores both in markets in
    which we currently operate and new markets.

Increasing our sales and profitability by expanding our
    prestige brand offerings.

Our strategy is to
    continue to expand our portfolio of products and brands, in
    particular to enhance our offering of prestige brands, both by
    capitalizing on the success of our existing vendor relationships
    and by identifying and developing new supply sources. We plan to
    continue to expand and attract additional prestige brands to our
    stores by increasing education for our beauty consultants,
    providing high levels of customer service, and tailoring the
    presentation and merchandising of these products in our stores
    to appeal to prestige vendors. For example, as of
    January 30, 2010, we have installed “boutique”
    areas of approximately 200 square feet in 215 of our stores
    to showcase and build brand equity for key vendors and to
    provide our customers with a place to experiment and learn about
    these products. We intend to install this feature in most of our
    stores over time. Over the last several years we have added
    several prestige brands including Juicy Couture, Ed Hardy and
    Marc Jacobs Lola fragrances, Pureology and Liquid Keratin hair
    care, Dermalogica, Korres, and Mario Badescu skin care, Benefit,
    Cargo, and Lorac cosmetics and Philosophy fragrance and bath. We
    continue to seek opportunities to test prestige brands in our
    stores in order to expand our prestige brand offerings. We
    believe this strategy will positively influence our number of
    customer transactions and their average transaction value.

Improving our profitability by leveraging our fixed
    costs.

We plan to continue to improve our
    operating results by leveraging our existing infrastructure and
    continually optimizing our operations. We will continue to make
    investments in our information systems to enable us to enhance
    our efficiency in areas such as merchandise planning and
    allocation, inventory management, distribution and point of sale
    (POS) functions. We believe we will continue to improve our
    profitability by reducing our operating expenses, in particular
    general corporate overhead and fixed costs, as a percentage of
    sales.

Continuing to enhance our brand awareness to generate sales
    growth.

We believe a key component of our success
    is the brand exposure we get from our marketing initiatives. Our
    direct mail advertising programs are designed to drive
    additional traffic to our stores by highlighting current
    promotional events and new product offerings. Our national
    magazine print advertising campaign exposes potential new
    customers to our retail concept by conveying an attractive and
    sophisticated brand message. We believe we have an opportunity
    to


increase our in-store marketing efforts as an additional means
    of educating our customers and increasing the frequency of their
    visits to our stores.

Driving increased customer traffic to our
    salons.

We are committed to establishing Ulta as
    a leading salon authority. We seek to increase salon traffic and
    grow salon revenues by providing high quality and consistent
    services from our licensed stylists, who are knowledgeable about
    the newest hair fashion trends. Our objective is to create
    customer loyalty, increase conversion of our retail customers to
    our salon services, encourage referrals and distinguish our
    salons from those of our competitors. Our stylists are trained
    to sell haircare products to their customers by demonstrating
    the products while styling their customers’ hair.
    Additionally, we have refined our recruiting methods, hiring
    procedures and training programs to enhance stylist retention,
    which is an important factor in salon productivity.

Expanding our

e-commerce

business.

In addition to re-launching our
    Ulta.com website and

e-commerce

platform in November 2007, we continue to aggressively develop
    and add new website features and functionality, marketing
    programs, product assortment and new brands, and multi-channel
    integration points to drive increased visitor traffic and
    revenue to this channel. We intend to establish ourselves over
    time as a leading online beauty resource for women by providing
    our customers with a rich online experience for information on
    key trends and products, editorial content, expanded
    assortments, leading website features and functionality, and
    social media content. Through our continued enhancements and
    multi-channel marketing initiatives, we believe we are well
    positioned to capitalize on the growth of Internet sales of
    beauty products. We believe our website and retail stores
    provide our customers with an integrated multi-channel shopping
    experience and increased flexibility for their beauty buying
    needs.

Our
    market

We operate within the large and steadily growing
    U.S. beauty products and salon services industry. This
    market represents approximately $80 billion in retail
    sales, according to a 2008 report by Kline & Company
    and IBISWorld Inc. The approximately $36 billion beauty
    products industry includes color cosmetics, haircare, fragrance,
    bath and body, skincare, salon styling tools and other
    toiletries. Within this market, we compete across all major
    categories as well as a range of price points by offering
    prestige, mass and salon products. The approximately
    $44 billion salon services industry consists of hair, face
    and nail services.

Distribution for beauty products is varied. Prestige products
    are typically purchased in department or specialty stores, while
    mass products and staple items are generally purchased at drug
    stores, food retail stores and mass merchandisers. In addition,
    salon haircare products are sold in salons and authorized
    professional retail outlets.

Competition

Our major competitors for prestige and mass products include
    traditional department stores such as Macy’s and Nordstrom,
    specialty stores such as Sephora and Bath & Body
    Works, drug stores such as CVS/pharmacy and Walgreens and mass
    merchandisers such as Target and Wal-Mart. We believe the
    principal bases upon which we compete are the quality and
    assortment of merchandise, our value proposition, the quality of
    our customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of
    our stores as one-stop destinations for beauty products and
    salon services.

The market for salon services and products is highly fragmented.
    Our competitors for salon services and products include Regis
    Corp., Sally Beauty, JCPenney salons, Premier Salons and
    independent salons.

Key
    trends

We believe an important shift is occurring in the distribution
    of beauty products. Department stores, which have traditionally
    been the primary distribution channel for prestige beauty
    products, have been meaningfully affected by changing consumer
    preferences and industry consolidation over the past decade. We
    believe women, particularly younger generations, tend to find
    department stores intimidating, high-pressured and hinder a
    multi-brand shopping experience and, as such, are choosing to
    shop elsewhere for their beauty care needs. According to NPD,
    55% of women aged 18 to 24 shop in specialty stores, compared to
    40% of women


aged 18 to 64. Over the past ten years, department stores have
    lost significant market share to specialty stores in apparel,
    and we believe the beauty category is undergoing a similar shift
    in retail channels. We believe women are seeking a shopping
    experience that provides something different, a place to
    experiment, learn about various products, find what they want
    and indulge themselves. A recent Kline & Company
    report found that consumers seek out specialty retailers for a
    number of reasons including that specialty stores carry more
    niche products, the merchandise and retail environment is more
    fun and provides the ability to shop across product lines and
    the customer service is better than in other channels.

As a result of this market transformation, there has been an
    increase in the number of prestige beauty brands pursuing new
    distribution channels for their products, such as specialty
    retail, spas and salons, direct response television (i.e., home
    shopping and infomercials) and the Internet. In addition, many
    smaller prestige brands are selling their products through these
    channels due to the high fixed costs associated with operating
    in most department stores and to capitalize on consumers’
    growing propensity to shop in these channels. According to
    industry sources, color cosmetics sales through these channels
    are projected to grow at a higher rate than sales of color
    cosmetics in total. We believe that, based on our recent success
    in attracting new prestige brands, we are well-positioned to
    continue to capture additional prestige brands as they expand
    into specialty stores. Also, there are a growing number of
    brands that have built significant consumer awareness and sales
    by initially offering their products on direct response
    television. We benefit from offering brands that sell their
    products through this channel, as we experience increased store
    traffic and sales after these brands appear on television.

Historically, manufacturers have distributed their products
    through distinct channels — department stores for
    prestige products, drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass
    products, and salons and authorized retail outlets for
    professional hair care products. We believe women are
    increasingly shopping across retail channels as well as
    purchasing a combination of prestige and mass beauty products.
    We attribute this trend to a number of factors, including the
    growing availability of prestige brands outside of department
    stores and increased innovation in mass products. Based on the
    competitive environment in which we operate, we believe that we
    have been at the forefront of breaking down the industry’s
    historical distribution paradigm by combining a wide range of
    beauty products, categories and price points under one roof. Our
    strategy reflects a more customer-centric model of how women
    prefer to shop today for their beauty needs.

Major growth drivers for the industry include favorable consumer
    spending trends, product innovation and growth of certain
    population segments.

•

Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964):  Baby
    Boomers have larger disposable incomes and are increasing their
    spending on personal care as well as health and wellness. The
    aging of the Baby Boomer generation is also influencing product
    innovation and demand for anti-aging products and cosmetic
    procedures.

•

Generation X (born between 1965 and 1976):  Generation
    X is entering their peak earning years and represents a
    significant contributor to overall consumer spending, including
    beauty products. A recent survey by American Express showed that
    Generation X spends 60% more on beauty products than
    Baby Boomers. In addition, while prior generations grew up
    shopping in department stores and general merchandisers,
    Generation X has grown up shopping in specialty stores and we
    believe seeks a retail environment that combines a compelling
    experience, functionality, variety and location.

•

Generation Y (born between 1977 and 1994):  According
    to the United States Census Bureau data, the 20 to
    34 year-old age group is expected to grow by approximately
    10% from 2003 to 2015. As Generation Y continues to enter the
    workforce, they will have increased disposable income to spend
    on beauty products.

We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends
    and capture additional market share in the industry. We believe
    we have demonstrated an ability to provide a differentiated
    store experience for customers as well as offer a breadth and
    depth of merchandise previously unavailable from more
    traditional beauty retailers.


Stores

We are conveniently located in high-traffic, primarily off-mall
    locations such as power centers and lifestyle centers with other
    destination retailers. Our typical store is approximately
    10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square
    feet dedicated to our full-service salon. We opened 37 stores in
    fiscal 2009 and the average investment required to open a new
    Ulta store is approximately $1.1 million, which includes
    capital investments, net of landlord contributions, pre-opening
    expenses, and initial inventory, net of payables. However, our
    net investment required to open new stores and the net sales
    generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of
    factors, including geographic location. As of January 30,
    2010, we operated 346 stores in 38 states.

Store
    remodel program

Our retail store concept, including physical layout, displays,
    lighting and quality of finishes, has continued to evolve over
    time to match the rising expectations of our customers and to
    keep pace with our merchandising and operating strategies. In
    recent years, our strategic focus has been on refining our new
    store model, improving our real estate selection process and
    executing on our new store opening program. As a result, we
    decided to limit the investments made in our existing store base
    from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, we developed
    and initiated a store remodel program to update our older stores
    to provide a consistent shopping experience across all of our
    locations. We remodeled 6 stores in fiscal 2009. We believe this
    program will improve the appeal of our stores, drive additional
    customer traffic and increase our sales and profitability. The
    remodel store selection process is subject to the same
    discipline as our new store real estate decision process. Our
    focus is to remodel the oldest, highest performing stores first,
    subject to criteria such as rate of return, lease terms, market
    performance and quality of real estate. The average investment
    to remodel a store in fiscal 2009 was approximately
    $0.9 million. Each remodel takes approximately
    13 weeks to complete, during which time we typically keep
    the store open.

Salon

We operate full-service salons in all of our stores. Our current
    Ulta store format includes an open and modern salon area with
    eight to ten stations. The entire salon area is approximately
    950 square feet with a concierge desk, esthetics room,
    semi-private shampoo and hair color processing areas. Each salon
    is a full-service salon offering hair cuts, hair coloring and
    permanent texture, with most salons also providing facials and
    waxing. We employ licensed professional stylists and
    estheticians that offer highly skilled services as well as an
    educational experience, including consultations, styling
    lessons, skincare regimens, and at-home care recommendations.

Ulta.com

We established Ulta.com to give our customers an integrated
    multi-channel buying experience by providing them with an
    opportunity to access product offerings and information beyond
    our

brick-and-mortar

retail stores. The Ulta.com website and experience supports the
    key elements of the Ulta brand proposition and provides access
    to more than 11,000 beauty products from hundreds of brands. As
    Ulta.com continues to grow in terms of functionality and
    content, it will become an even greater element in Ulta’s
    customer loyalty programs and a more important resource for our
    customers to access product and store information, beauty trends
    and techniques, and buy from a large assortment of product
    offerings.

Merchandising

Strategy

We focus on offering one of the most extensive product and brand
    selections in our industry, including a broad assortment of
    branded and private label beauty products in cosmetics,
    fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products and salon
    styling tools. A typical Ulta store carries over 19,000 basic
    and over 2,000 promotional products. We present these products
    in an assisted self-service environment using centrally produced
    planograms (detailed schematics showing product placement in the
    store) and promotional


merchandising planners. Our merchandising team continually
    monitors current fashion trends, historical sales trends and new
    product launches to keep Ulta’s product assortment fresh
    and relevant to our customers. We believe our broad selection of
    merchandise, from moderate-priced brands to higher-end prestige
    brands, offers a unique shopping experience for our customers.
    The products we sell can also be found in department stores,
    specialty stores, salons, mass merchandisers and drug stores,
    but we offer all of these products in one retail format so that
    our customer can find everything she needs in one stop. We
    believe we offer a compelling value proposition to our customers
    across all of our product categories. For example, we run
    frequent promotions and gift coupons for our mass brands,
    gift-with-purchase offers and multi-product gift sets for our
    prestige brands, and a comprehensive customer loyalty program.

We believe our private label products are a strategically
    important category for growth and profit contribution. Our
    objective is to provide quality, trend-right private label
    products at a good value to continue to strengthen our
    customers’ perception of Ulta as a contemporary beauty
    destination. Ulta manages the full development cycle of these
    products from concept through production in order to deliver
    differentiated packaging and formulas to build brand image.
    Current Ulta cosmetics and bath brands have a strong following
    and we have plans to expand our private label products into
    additional categories.

Category
    mix

We offer products in the following categories:

•

Cosmetics, which includes products for the face, eyes, cheeks,
    lips and nails;

•

Haircare, which includes shampoos, conditioners, styling
    products, and hair accessories;

•

Salon styling tools, which includes hair dryers, curling irons
    and flat irons;

•

Skincare and bath and body, which includes products for the
    face, hands and body;

•

Fragrance for both men and women;

•

Private label, consisting of Ulta branded cosmetics, skincare,
    bath and body products and haircare; and

•

Other, including candles, home fragrance products and other
    miscellaneous health and beauty products.

Organization

Our merchandising team reports directly to our CEO and consists
    of a Senior Vice President of Merchandising who oversees; Senior
    Vice President of Prestige Cosmetics; Vice President of Mass
    Cosmetics, Skincare and Haircare; Vice President of Brand
    Identity and Store Design; Vice President of Merchandise
    Operations; Divisional Merchandise Manager of Fragrance, Bath
    and Gift with Purchase and Prestige Skincare; Divisional
    Merchandise Manager of Salon Products; and Divisional
    Merchandise Manager of Styling Tools. Reporting to the Senior
    Vice President of Merchandising are approximately 23 Divisional
    Merchandise Managers, Senior Buyers, Buyers and
    Assistant/Associate Buyers. Our merchandising team works
    directly with our centralized planning and replenishment group
    to ensure a consistent delivery of products across our store
    base.

Our planogram department assists the merchants and replenishment
    team to keep new products flowing into stores on a timely basis.
    All major product categories undergo planogram revisions once or
    twice a year and adjustments are made to assortment mix and
    product placement based on current sales trends.

Our visual department works with our merchandising team on every
    advertising event regarding strategic placement of promotional
    merchandise, along with functional signage and creative product
    presentation standards, in all of our stores. All stores receive
    a centrally produced promotional planner for each event to
    ensure consistent implementation.

Planning
    and allocation

We have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic
    inventory planning and allocation process to support our
    merchandising strategy. We centrally manage product
    replenishment to our stores through our


planning and replenishment group. This group serves as a
    strategic partner to, and provides financial oversight of, the
    merchandising team. The merchandising team creates a sales
    forecast by category for the year. Our planning and
    replenishment group creates an

open-to-buy

plan, approved by senior executives, for each product category.
    The

open-to-buy

plan is updated weekly with POS data, receipts and inventory
    levels and is used throughout the year to balance buying
    opportunities and inventory return on investment. We believe
    this structure maximizes our buying opportunities while
    maintaining organizational and financial control. Regularly
    replenished products are presented consistently in all stores
    utilizing a merchandising planogram process. POS data is used to
    calculate sales forecasts and to determine replenishment levels.
    We determine promotional product replenishment levels using
    sales histories from similar or comparable events. To ensure our
    inventory remains productive, our planning and replenishment
    group, along with senior executives, monitors the levels of
    clearance and aged inventory in our stores on a weekly basis.

Vendor
    relationships

We work with over 300 vendors. Our Senior Vice President of
    Merchandising & Store Design has over 30 years of
    experience and each merchandising vice president has over
    15 years of experience developing relationships in the
    industry with which he or she works. We have no long-term supply
    agreements or exclusive arrangements with our vendors. Our top
    ten vendors represent approximately 46% of our total annual
    sales. These include vendors across all product categories, such
    as Bare Escentuals, Farouk Systems, Helen of Troy,
    L’Oréal and Procter & Gamble, among others.
    We believe our vendors view us as a significant distribution
    channel for growth and brand enhancement.

Marketing
    and advertising

Marketing
    strategy

We employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy to increase brand
    awareness and drive traffic to our stores. Our marketing
    strategy complements a basic tenet of our business strategy,
    which is to provide our customers with a satisfying and
    uplifting experience. We communicate this vision through a
    multi-media approach. Our primary media expenditure is in direct
    mail catalogs and free-standing newspaper inserts. These
    vehicles allow the customer to see the breadth of our selection
    of prestige, mass and salon beauty products.

In order to reach new customers and to establish Ulta as a
    national brand, we advertise in national magazines such as
    InStyle, Allure, Lucky, Elle and Vanity Fair. These advertising
    channels have proven successful in raising our brand awareness
    on a national level and driving additional sales from both
    existing and new customers. In conjunction with our national
    brand advertising, we have initiated a public relations strategy
    that focuses on reaching top tier magazine editors to ensure
    consistent messaging in beauty magazines as well as

direct-to-customer

efforts through multi-media channels.

Our

e-commerce

marketing strategy complements our print media strategy.
    Ulta.com serves as an extension of Ulta’s marketing and
    prospecting strategies (beyond catalogs, newspaper inserts and
    national advertising) by exposing potential new customers to the
    Ulta brand and product offerings. This role for Ulta.com is
    being implemented through online marketing strategies including
    search marketing, affiliate marketing, social networking, banner
    advertising, and other online marketing channels.
    Ulta.com’s email marketing programs are also effective in
    communicating with and driving sales from online and retail
    store customers. In October 2009, we launched a Facebook
    application for the Company’s “Windows of Love”
    campaign in support of our Breast Cancer Research Foundation
    program. In December 2009, we launched an interactive microsite
    to support the Company’s “12 Days of Holiday”
    marketing campaign.

Customer
    loyalty programs

We maintain two customer loyalty programs. Our national program
    provides reward point certificates for free beauty products.
    Customers earn purchase-based reward points and redeem the
    related reward certificate during specific promotional periods
    during the year. We are also piloting a loyalty program in
    several markets in which customers earn purchase-based points on
    an annual basis which can be redeemed at any time. We


have approximately seven million customer loyalty program
    members, the majority of whom have shopped at one of our stores
    within the past 12 months.

Staffing
    and operations

Retail

Our current Ulta store format is staffed with a general manager,
    a salon manager, three to four assistant managers, and
    approximately twenty full and part-time associates, including
    approximately six to eight prestige consultants and eight to ten
    licensed salon professionals. The management team in each store
    reports to the general manager. The general manager oversees all
    store activities including salon management, inventory
    management, merchandising, cash management, scheduling, hiring
    and guest services. Members of store management receive bonuses
    depending on their position and based upon sales, shrink,
    payroll, or a combination of these three factors. Each general
    manager reports to a district manager, who in turn reports to
    the Vice President of Operations East or the Vice President of
    Operations West. The Vice Presidents of East and West report to
    the Senior Vice President of Operations who in turn reports to
    our Chief Executive Officer. Each store team receives additional
    support from time to time from recruiting specialists for the
    retail and salon operations, a field loss prevention team, salon
    technical trainers, management trainers and vendors.

Ulta stores are open seven days a week, eleven hours a day,
    Monday through Saturday, and seven hours on Sunday. Our stores
    have extended hours during the holiday season.

Salon

A typical salon is staffed with eight to ten licensed salon
    professionals, including a salon manager, six stylists, and one
    to two estheticians. Our higher producing salons have a guest
    coordinator and an assistant manager. Our salon technical
    trainers and vendor education classes create a comprehensive
    educational program for approximately 2,700 Ulta salon
    professionals.

Training
    and development

Our success is dependent in part on our ability to attract,
    train, retain and motivate qualified employees at all levels of
    the organization. We have developed a corporate culture that
    enables individual store managers to make store-level operating
    decisions and consistently rewards their success. We are
    committed to improving the skills and careers of our workforce
    and providing advancement opportunities for our associates. Our
    associates and management teams are essential to our store
    expansion strategy. We primarily use existing managers or
    promote from within to support our new stores, although many
    outlying stores have all-new teams.

All of our associates participate in an interactive new-hire
    orientation through which each associate becomes acquainted with
    Ulta’s vision and mission. Training for new store managers,
    prestige consultants and sales associates familiarizes them with
    opening and closing routines, guest service expectations, our
    loss prevention policy and procedures, and our culture. We also
    have ongoing development programs that include operational
    training for hourly associates, prestige consultants, management
    and stylists. We provide continuing education to both salon
    professionals and retail associates throughout their careers at
    Ulta to enable them to deliver the “Five E’s” to
    our customers. In contrast to the sales teams at traditional
    department stores, our sales teams are not commissioned or
    brand-dedicated. Our prestige consultants are trained to work
    across all prestige lines and within our prestige
    “boutiques”, where customers can receive a makeover or
    skin analysis.

Distribution

We operate two distribution facilities. The first facility,
    located in Romeoville, Illinois, is approximately
    317,000 square feet in size, including an overflow
    facility. During fiscal 2008, we began operating a second
    distribution facility in Phoenix, Arizona that is approximately
    330,000 square feet in size.

Inventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution
    facilities. We carry over 21,000 products and replenish our
    stores with such products primarily in eaches (i.e.,

less-than-case

quantities), which allows us to


ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a
    particular product is required. Our distribution facilities use
    warehouse management and warehouse control software systems,
    which have been upgraded or installed in the last few years.
    Products are bar-coded and scanned using handheld
    radio-frequency devices as they move within the warehouse to
    ensure accuracy. Product is delivered to stores using contract
    carriers. One vendor currently provides store-ready orders that
    can be quickly forwarded to our stores. We use carton barcode
    labels to facilitate these shipments.

Information
    technology

We are committed to using technology to enhance our competitive
    position. We depend on a variety of information systems and
    technologies to maintain and improve our competitive position
    and to manage the operations of our growing store base. We rely
    on computer systems to provide information for all areas of our
    business, including supply chain, merchandising, POS,

e-commerce,

finance, accounting and human resources. Our core business
    systems consist mostly of a purchased software program that
    integrates with our internally developed software solutions. Our
    technology also includes a company-wide network that connects
    all corporate users, stores, and our distribution infrastructure
    and provides communications for credit card and daily polling of
    sales and merchandise movement at the store level. We intend to
    leverage our technology infrastructure and systems where
    appropriate to gain operational efficiencies through more
    effective use of our systems, people and processes. We update
    the technology supporting our stores, distribution
    infrastructure and corporate headquarters on a continual basis.
    We will continue to make investments in our information systems
    to facilitate our growth and enable us to enhance our
    competitive position.

Intellectual
    property

We have registered a number of trademarks in the United States,
    including Ulta Salon Cosmetics Fragrance (and design), Ulta.com,
    and Ulta Beauty and two related designs. The renewal dates for
    the identified marks are January 22, 2012 (Ulta Salon
    Cosmetics Fragrance (and design)), October 8, 2012
    (Ulta.com), July 10, 2017 (Ulta Beauty) and
    October 16, 2017 (the two Ulta Beauty related designs). All
    marks that are deemed material to our business have been
    registered in the United States and select foreign countries. We
    have applications pending for certain of these marks in Canada.

We believe our trademarks, especially those related to the Ulta
    brand, have significant value and are important to building
    brand recognition.

Government
    regulation

In our U.S. markets, we are affected by extensive laws,
    governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court
    decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and
    other constraints may exist at the federal, state or local
    levels in the United States. Our Ulta branded products are
    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
    the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and State Attorneys General
    in the United States. Such regulations principally relate to the
    safety of our ingredients, proper labeling, advertising,
    packaging and marketing of our products.

Products classified as cosmetics (as defined in the Food, Drug
    and Cosmetic (FDC) Act) are not subject to pre-market approval
    by the FDA, but the products and the ingredients must be tested
    to ensure safety. The FDA also utilizes an “intended
    use” doctrine to determine whether a product is a drug or
    cosmetic by the labeling claims made for the product. Certain
    ingredients commonly used in cosmetics products such as
    sunscreens and acne treatment ingredients are classified as

over-the-counter

drugs which have specific label requirements and allowable
    claims. The labeling of cosmetic products is subject to the
    requirements of the FDC Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act
    and other FDA regulations.

The government regulations that most impact our

day-to-day

operations are the labor and employment and taxation laws to
    which most retailers are typically subject. We are also subject
    to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and
    typical advertising and consumer protection laws (both federal
    and state). Our salon business is subject to state board
    regulations and state licensing requirements for our stylists
    and our salon procedures.


In our store leases, we require our landlords to obtain all
    necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used
    as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning
    approvals and permits for our specific use (but at times the
    responsibility for obtaining zoning approvals and permits for
    our specific use falls to us). We require our landlords to
    deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on
    our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are
    located. We are responsible for delivering a certificate of
    occupancy for any remodeling or build-outs that we perform and
    are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in
    connection with such construction projects or build-outs.

Associates

As of January 30, 2010, we employed approximately
    3,500 people on a full-time basis and approximately 6,800
    on a part-time basis. We have no collective bargaining
    agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and
    believe we have good relationships with our associates.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk
    and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the following
    risks and all of the other information contained in this

Form 10-K

before making an investment decision. If any of the following
    risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of
    operations or future growth could suffer. In these
    circumstances, the market price of our common stock could
    decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The
    risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.
    Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently
    consider immaterial also may adversely affect our company.

The
    recent global economic crisis and continued volatility in global
    economic conditions and the financial markets as well as
    prolonged declines in consumer spending may adversely affect our
    liquidity and financial condition.

The global economic crisis and the continued volatility and
    disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a
    significant, adverse impact on global economic conditions,
    resulting in additional significant recessionary pressures and
    declines in consumer confidence and economic growth. These
    conditions have led to decreases in consumer spending across the
    economy. Increases in the levels of unemployment, energy costs,
    healthcare costs and taxes, combined with tighter credit
    markets, reduced consumer confidence and other factors,
    contribute to the decline in consumer spending. Although there
    has been limited recent improvement in some of these measures,
    the level of consumer spending is not where it was prior to the
    global recession. Such reduced consumer spending could cause
    changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of
    inventory purchased by our customers, which may adversely affect
    our industry, business and financial condition.


Economic conditions have also resulted in a substantial
    tightening of the credit markets, including lending by financial
    institutions, which is a source of capital for our borrowing and
    liquidity. This tightening of the credit markets has increased
    the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit.
    Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the
    strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and
    institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to
    provide credit to businesses and consumers. These factors have
    led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike,
    and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending.
    It is difficult to predict how long the current economic and
    capital and credit market conditions will continue, the extent
    to which they will continue to deteriorate, if at all, and which
    aspects of our products or business may be adversely affected.
    Current market and credit conditions could make it more
    difficult for developers and landlords to obtain the necessary
    credit to build new retail centers. A significant decrease in
    new retail center development has adversely affected our new
    store program and could limit our future growth opportunities as
    long as the aforementioned conditions exist. Continued
    turbulence in the United States and international markets and
    economies and prolonged declines in consumer spending may
    adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition,
    including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and
    access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs.

A
    further downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of
    discretionary beauty products and salon services, which could
    delay our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition, profitability and cash
    flows.

Our financial condition may be materially affected by conditions
    in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in
    the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. The stress
    experienced by global capital markets that began in the second
    half of 2007 continued and substantially increased during 2008
    and 2009. Concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical
    issues, the availability and cost of credit, the
    U.S. mortgage market and a declining real estate market in
    the U.S. have contributed to increased volatility and
    diminished expectations for the economy. We offer a wide
    selection of beauty products and premium salon services.
    Continued uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact
    levels of consumer discretionary spending across all of our
    product categories including prestige beauty products and
    premium salon services. Factors that could affect
    consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases
    include general business conditions, levels of employment,
    interest rates and tax rates, the availability of consumer
    credit, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. A
    decrease in spending due to lower consumer discretionary income
    or consumer confidence could adversely impact our net sales and
    operating results, and could force us to delay or slow our
    growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.

Additionally, the general deterioration in economic conditions
    could adversely affect our commercial partners including our
    product vendors as well as the real estate developers and
    landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in
    which our stores are located. A bankruptcy or financial failure
    of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate
    developers or shopping center landlords could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
    profitability, and cash flows.

We may
    be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive
    markets.

The markets for beauty products and salon services are highly
    competitive with few barriers to entry even when economic
    conditions are favorable. We compete against a diverse group of
    retailers, both small and large, including regional and national
    department stores, specialty retailers, drug stores, mass
    merchandisers, high-end and discount salon chains, locally owned
    beauty retailers and salons, Internet businesses, catalog
    retailers and direct response television, including television
    home shopping retailers and infomercials. We believe the
    principal bases upon which we compete are the quality of
    merchandise, our value proposition, the quality of our
    customers’ shopping experience and the convenience of our
    stores as one-stop destinations for beauty products and salon
    services. Many of our competitors are, and many of our potential
    competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing
    and other resources and therefore may be able to adapt to
    changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater
    resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate
    greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive
    pricing policies than we can.


As a result, we may lose market share, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

If we
    are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer
    preferences in a timely manner, our sales will
    decrease.

We believe our success depends in substantial part on our
    ability to:

•

recognize and define product and beauty trends;

•

anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a
    timely manner;

•

translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product and
    service offerings in our stores and salons in advance of our
    competitors;

•

develop and maintain vendor relationships that provide us access
    to the newest merchandise on reasonable terms; and

•

distribute merchandise to our stores in an efficient and
    effective manner and maintain appropriate in-stock levels.

If we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs
    of the regions in which we operate, our net sales may decrease
    and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slow-moving
    merchandise, either of which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

If we
    fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract
    qualified new personnel, such failure could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our
    organization. This execution requires an experienced and
    talented management team. Ms. Kirby, our President and
    Chief Executive Officer since December 1999, is important to our
    business, including her relationships with our vendors and
    influence on our sales and marketing. Ms. Kirby has an
    agreement to remain employed with us through March 2011, and if
    we lost Ms. Kirby’s services before the conclusion of
    this agreement, it could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. In
    addition, if we were to lose the benefit of the experience,
    efforts and abilities of other key executive personnel, it could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our ability to
    manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to
    train, motivate and manage our associates. We will need to
    attract, motivate and retain additional qualified executive,
    managerial and merchandising personnel and store associates.
    Competition for this type of personnel is intense, and we may
    not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining the
    personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably.

We
    intend to continue to open new stores, which could strain our
    resources and have a material adverse effect on our business and
    financial performance.

Our continued and future growth largely depends on our ability
    to successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable
    basis. During fiscal 2009, we opened 37 new stores. We intend to
    continue to grow our number of stores for the foreseeable
    future, and believe we have the long-term potential to grow our
    store base to over 1,000 stores in the United States. During
    fiscal 2009, the average investment required to open a typical
    new store is approximately $1.1 million. This continued
    expansion could place increased demands on our financial,
    managerial, operational and administrative resources. For
    example, our planned expansion will require us to increase the
    number of people we employ as well as to monitor and upgrade our
    management information and other systems and our distribution
    infrastructure. These increased demands and operating
    complexities could cause us to operate our business less
    efficiently, have a material adverse effect on our operations
    and financial performance and slow our growth.


The
    capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment
    infrastructure may not be adequate to support our recent growth
    and expected future growth plans, which could prevent the
    successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur
    costs to expand this infrastructure, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

We operate two distribution facilities, which house the
    distribution operations for Ulta retail stores together with the
    order fulfillment operations of our

e-commerce

business. In order to support our recent and expected future
    growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business,
    additional distribution centers may need to be added in the
    future. Our failure to expand our distribution capacity on a
    timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Any
    significant interruption in the operations of our two
    distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to deliver
    merchandise to our stores in a timely manner, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We distribute products to our stores without supplementing such
    deliveries with

direct-to-store

arrangements from vendors or wholesalers. We are a retailer
    carrying over 21,000 beauty products that change on a regular
    basis in response to beauty trends, which makes the success of
    our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our
    distribution infrastructure. Any significant interruption in the
    operation of our supply chain infrastructure, such as
    disruptions in our information systems, disruptions in
    operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, labor
    disagreements, or shipping and transportation problems, could
    drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and
    provide products and services to our stores, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Any
    material disruption of our information systems could negatively
    impact financial results and materially adversely affect our
    business operations, particularly during the holiday
    season.

We are increasingly dependent on a variety of information
    systems to effectively manage the operations of our growing
    store base and fulfill customer orders from our

e-commerce

business. We have identified the need to expand and upgrade our
    information systems to support recent and expected future
    growth. The failure of our information systems to perform as
    designed could have an adverse effect on our business and
    results of our operations. Any material disruption of our
    systems could disrupt our ability to track, record and analyze
    the merchandise that we sell and could negatively impact our
    operations, shipment of goods, ability to process financial
    information and credit card transactions, and our ability to
    receive and process

e-commerce

orders or engage in normal business activities. Moreover,
    security breaches or leaks of proprietary information, including
    leaks of customers’ private data, could result in
    liability, decrease customer confidence in our company, and
    weaken our ability to compete in the marketplace, which could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Our

e-commerce

operations, while relatively small, are increasingly important
    to our business. The Ulta.com website serves as an effective
    extension of Ulta’s marketing and prospecting strategies
    (beyond catalogs, newspaper inserts and national advertising) by
    exposing potential new customers to the Ulta brand, product
    offerings, and enhanced content. As the importance of our
    website and

e-commerce

operations to our business grows, we are increasingly vulnerable
    to website downtime and other technical failures. Our failure to
    successfully respond to these risks could reduce

e-commerce

sales and damage our brand’s reputation.

Increased
    costs or interruption in our third-party vendors’ overseas
    sourcing operations could disrupt production, shipment or
    receipt of some of our merchandise, which would result in lost
    sales and could increase our costs.

We directly source the majority of our gift-with-purchase and
    other promotional products through third-party vendors using
    foreign factories. In addition, many of our vendors use overseas
    sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their
    products. Any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing
    or imports from such foreign countries, including the imposition
    of additional import restrictions, unanticipated political


changes, increased customs duties, legal or economic
    restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and
    deliver products, and natural disasters, could materially harm
    our operations. We have no long-term supply contracts with
    respect to such foreign-sourced items, many of which are subject
    to existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas that may
    limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be
    imported into the United States from such countries. Our
    business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally
    associated with sourcing goods from abroad, such as political
    instability, disruption of imports by labor disputes and local
    business practices. Our sourcing operations may also be hurt by
    health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in
    which our merchandise is produced, adverse weather conditions or
    natural disasters that may occur overseas or acts of war or
    terrorism in the United States or worldwide, to the extent these
    acts affect the production, shipment or receipt of merchandise.
    Our future operations and performance will be subject to these
    factors, which are beyond our control, and these factors could
    materially hurt our business, financial condition and results of
    operations or may require us to modify our current business
    practices and incur increased costs.

A
    reduction in traffic to, or the closing of, the other
    destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are
    located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with
    unsold inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

As a result of our real estate strategy, most of our stores are
    located in off-mall shopping areas known as power centers or
    lifestyle centers, which also accommodate other well-known
    destination retailers. Power centers typically contain three to
    five big-box anchor stores along with a variety of smaller
    specialty tenants, while lifestyle centers typically contain a
    variety of high-end destination retailers but no large anchor
    stores. As a consequence of most of our stores being located in
    such shopping areas, our sales are derived, in part, from the
    volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers
    and the anchor stores in the lifestyle centers and power centers
    where our stores are located. Customer traffic to these shopping
    areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such
    destination retailers or anchor stores, or by a reduction in
    traffic to such stores resulting from a regional economic
    downturn, a general downturn in the local area where our store
    is located, or a decline in the desirability of the shopping
    environment of a particular power center or lifestyle center.
    Such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and
    leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. We may respond by increasing markdowns or
    initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory,
    which would further decrease our gross profits and net income.
    This risk is more pronounced during the current severe economic
    downturn which has resulted in a number of national retailers
    filing for bankruptcy or closing stores due to depressed
    consumer spending levels.

Diversion
    of exclusive salon products, or a decision by manufacturers of
    exclusive salon products to utilize other distribution channels,
    could negatively impact our revenue from the sale of such
    products, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

The retail products that we sell in our salons are meant to be
    sold exclusively by professional salons and authorized
    professional retail outlets. However, incidents of product
    diversion occur, which involve the selling of salon exclusive
    haircare products to unauthorized channels such as drug stores,
    grocery stores or mass merchandisers. Diversion could result in
    adverse publicity that harms the commercial prospects of our
    products (if diverted products are old, tainted or damaged), as
    well as lower product revenues should consumers choose to
    purchase diverted product from these channels rather than
    purchasing from one of our salons. Additionally, the various
    product manufacturers could in the future decide to utilize
    other distribution channels for such products, therefore
    widening the availability of these products in other retail
    channels, which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from
    the sale of such products.


We
    rely on our good relationships with vendors to purchase
    prestige, mass and salon beauty products on reasonable terms. If
    these relationships were to be impaired, or if certain vendors
    were unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with
    our growth plans, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient
    selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms, and we
    may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty
    products, either of which could have a material adverse effect
    on our competitive position, our business and financial
    performance.

We have no long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements
    with vendors and, therefore, our success depends on maintaining
    good relationships with our vendors. Our business depends to a
    significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors
    to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products
    to stock our stores. Some of our prestige vendors may not have
    the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep
    pace with our growth plans. We also have strategic partnerships
    with certain core brands, which have allowed us to benefit from
    the growing popularity of such brands. Any of our other core
    brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its
    partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our
    competitors, which could negatively impact the revenue we earn
    from the sale of such products. If we fail to maintain strong
    relationships with our existing vendors, or fail to continue
    acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional
    vendors of beauty products, our ability to obtain a sufficient
    amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be
    limited, which could have a negative impact on our competitive
    position.

During fiscal 2009, merchandise supplied to Ulta by our top ten
    vendors accounted for approximately 46% of our net sales. The
    loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made
    available to us by any one of these key vendors, or by any of
    our other vendors, could have an adverse effect on our business.

If we
    are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our
    brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We regard our trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade
    secrets, know-how and similar intellectual property as critical
    to our success. Our principal intellectual property rights
    include registered and common law trademarks on our name,
    “Ulta,” and other marks incorporating that name,
    copyrights in our website content, rights to our domain name
    www.ulta.com and trade secrets and know-how with respect to our
    Ulta branded product formulations, product sourcing, sales and
    marketing and other aspects of our business. As such, we rely on
    trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and
    confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees,
    consultants, suppliers and others to protect our proprietary
    rights. If we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our
    trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other proprietary
    rights for any reason, or if other parties infringe on our
    intellectual property rights, our brand and reputation could be
    impaired and we could lose customers.

If our
    manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured
    uniquely for Ulta, including Ulta branded products and
    gift-with-purchase and other promotional products, consistent
    with applicable regulatory requirements, we could suffer lost
    sales and be required to take costly corrective action, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and
    therefore depend upon independent third-party vendors for the
    manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for Ulta,
    including Ulta branded products and gift-with-purchase and other
    promotional products. Our third-party manufacturers of Ulta
    products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to
    product specifications and quality and may not continue to
    produce products that are consistent with applicable regulatory
    requirements. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to
    comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be
    required to take costly corrective action. In addition,
    sanctions under the FDC Act may include seizure of products,
    injunctions against future shipment of products, restitution and
    disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions and criminal
    prosecution. The FDA does not have a pre-market approval system
    for cosmetics, and we believe we are permitted to market our
    cosmetics and have them manufactured without submitting safety
    or efficacy data to the FDA. However, the FDA may in the future
    determine to regulate our cosmetics or the ingredients included
    in our cosmetics as drugs. These events could interrupt the
    marketing and sale of our Ulta products, severely


damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace,
    increase the cost of our products, cause us to fail to meet
    customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver
    merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to
    our stores, any of which could result in lost sales, which could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

We, as
    well as our vendors, are subject to laws and regulations that
    could require us to modify our current business practices and
    incur increased costs, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

In our U.S. markets, numerous laws and regulations at the
    federal, state and local levels can affect our business. Legal
    requirements are frequently changed and subject to
    interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost
    of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our
    operations. If we fail to comply with any present or future laws
    or regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, a
    prohibition on the operation of our stores or a prohibition on
    the sale of our Ulta branded products. In particular, failure to
    adequately comply with the following legal requirements could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    conditions and results of operations:

•

Our rapidly expanding workforce, growing in pace with our number
    of stores, makes us vulnerable to changes in labor and
    employment laws. In addition, changes in federal and state
    minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits
    could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs,
    which could hurt our profitability and affect our growth
    strategy.

•

Our salon business is subject to state board regulations and
    state licensing requirements for our stylists and our salon
    procedures. Failure to maintain compliance with these regulatory
    and licensing requirements could jeopardize the viability of our
    salons.

•

We operate stores in California, which has enacted legislation
    commonly referred to as “Proposition 65” requiring
    that “clear and reasonable” warnings be given to
    consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the State of
    California to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. Although we
    have sought to comply with Proposition 65 requirements, there
    can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by
    litigation relating to Proposition 65.

In addition, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging,
    labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our vendors’
    products and our Ulta products are subject to extensive
    regulation by various federal agencies, including the FDA, the
    FTC and state attorneys general in the United States. If we, our
    vendors or the manufacturers of our Ulta products fail to comply
    with those regulations, we could become subject to significant
    penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations
    or our ability to conduct our business. In addition, the
    adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of
    existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs
    or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the
    marketability of our vendors’ products or our Ulta
    products, resulting in significant loss of net sales. Our
    failure to comply with FTC or state regulations that cover our
    vendors’ products or our Ulta product claims and
    advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, may
    result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or
    otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products.

As we
    grow the number of our stores in new cities and states, we are
    subject to local building codes in an increasing number of local
    jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with local building codes,
    and the failure of our landlords to obtain certificates of
    occupancy in a timely manner, could cause delays in our new
    store openings, which could increase our store opening costs,
    cause us to incur lost sales and profits, and damage our public
    reputation.

Ensuring compliance with local zoning and real estate land use
    restrictions across numerous jurisdictions is increasingly
    challenging as we grow the number of our stores in new cities
    and states. Our store leases generally require us to provide a
    certificate of occupancy with respect to the interior build-out
    of our stores (landlords generally provide the certificate of
    occupancy with respect to the shell of the store and the larger
    shopping area and common areas), and while we strive to remain
    in compliance with local building codes relating to the interior
    buildout of our stores, the constantly increasing number of
    local jurisdictions in which


we operate makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of
    changes in, and requirements of, local building codes and local
    building and fire inspectors’ interpretations of such
    building codes. Moreover, our landlords have occasionally been
    unable, due to the requirements of local zoning laws, to obtain
    in a timely manner a certificate of occupancy with respect to
    the shell of our stores

and/or

the
    larger shopping centers

and/or

common areas (which certificate of occupancy is required by
    local building codes for us to open our store), causing us in
    some instances to delay store openings. As the number of local
    building codes and local building and fire inspectors to which
    we and our landlords are subject increases, we may be
    increasingly vulnerable to increased construction costs and
    delays in store openings caused by our or our landlords’
    compliance with local building codes and local building and fire
    inspectors’ interpretations of such building codes, which
    increased construction costs

and/or

delays in store openings could increase our store opening costs,
    cause us to incur lost sales and profits, and damage our public
    reputation.

Our
    Ulta products and salon services may cause unexpected and
    undesirable side effects that could result in their
    discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits, either of which could
    result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Unexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our Ulta
    products for which we have not provided sufficient label
    warnings, or salon services which may have been performed
    negligently, could result in the discontinuance of sales of our
    products or of certain salon services or prevent us from
    achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected
    products and services. Such side effects could also expose us to
    product liability or negligence lawsuits. Any claims brought
    against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy
    coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is in excess of
    our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves,
    which would reduce our capital resources. Further, we may not
    have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment, in which
    case our creditors could levy against our assets. These events
    could cause negative publicity regarding our company, brand or
    products, which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Legal
    proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property
    infringement may require us to spend time and money and could
    prevent us from developing certain aspects of our business
    operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our technologies, promotional products purchased from
    third-party vendors, or Ulta products or potential products in
    development may infringe rights under patents, patent
    applications, trademark, copyright or other intellectual
    property rights of third parties in the United States and
    abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us that
    would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful,
    could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a third
    party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit
    against us, we could be forced to stop or delay development,
    manufacturing, or sales of the product that is the subject of
    the suit.

As a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to
    avoid potential claims, we may choose to seek, or be required to
    seek, a license from the third party and would most likely be
    required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These
    licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.
    Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product
    or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if,
    as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property
    infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on
    acceptable terms. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the
    rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors
    access to the same intellectual property. The inability to enter
    into licenses could harm our business significantly.

In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a
    party to other patent or trademark litigation and other
    proceedings, including interference proceedings declared by the
    United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) proceedings
    before the USPTO’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and
    opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding
    intellectual property rights with respect to products purchased
    from third-party vendors or our Ulta branded products and
    technology. Some of our competitors


may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or
    proceedings better than us because of their substantially
    greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the
    initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation
    or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the
    marketplace. Intellectual property litigation and other
    proceedings may also absorb significant management time and
    resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Increases
    in the demand for, or the price of, raw materials used to build
    and remodel our stores could hurt our
    profitability.

The raw materials used to build and remodel our stores are
    subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused
    by weather, supply conditions, government regulations, general
    economic conditions and other unpredictable factors. As a
    retailer engaged in an active building and remodeling program,
    we are particularly vulnerable to increases in construction and
    remodeling costs. As a result, increases in the demand for, or
    the price of, raw materials could hurt our profitability.

Increases
    in costs of mailing, paper and printing will affect the cost of
    our catalog and promotional mailings, which will reduce our
    profitability.

Postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the
    cost of our catalog and promotional mailings. In response to any
    future increases in mailing costs, we may consider reducing the
    number and size of certain catalog editions. In addition, we
    rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as
    discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier
    routes. We are not a party to any long-term contracts for the
    supply of paper. The cost of paper fluctuates significantly, and
    our future paper costs are subject to supply and demand forces
    that we cannot control. Future additional increases in postal
    rates or in paper or printing costs would reduce our
    profitability to the extent that we are unable to offset those
    increases by raising selling prices or by reducing the number
    and size of certain catalog editions.

Our
    secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive
    covenants that could limit our operational flexibility,
    including our ability to open stores.

We have a $200 million secured revolving credit facility,
    or credit facility, with a term expiring May 2011. Substantially
    all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding
    borrowings under the agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear
    interest at the prime rate or the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00% up
    to $100 million and 1.25% thereafter. The credit facility
    agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants
    relating to our management and the operation of our business.
    These covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to
    grant liens on our assets, incur additional indebtedness, pay
    cash dividends and redeem our stock, enter into transactions
    with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another entity.
    These covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and
    any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment
    obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit
    facility and, in certain circumstances, may allow the lenders
    thereunder to require repayment. In addition, when our current
    facility matures in May 2011, we may be unable to obtain similar
    terms on a new credit facility due to the uncertainty and
    volatility in the credit markets.

We
    will need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth
    strategy, and we may be unable to raise capital when needed,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

From time to time we will seek additional equity or debt
    financing to provide for capital expenditures and working
    capital consistent with our growth strategy. In addition, if
    general economic, financial or political conditions in our
    markets change, or if other circumstances arise that have a
    material effect on our cash flow, the anticipated cash needs of
    our business as well as our belief as to the adequacy of our
    available sources of capital could change significantly. Any of
    these events or circumstances could result in significant
    additional funding needs, requiring us to raise additional
    capital to meet those needs. If financing is not available on
    satisfactory terms or at all, we may be unable to execute our
    growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may
    suffer.


Failure
    to maintain adequate financial and management processes and
    controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and
    could harm our ability to manage our expenses.

Reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated
    growth are likely to place a considerable strain on our
    financial and management systems, processes and controls, as
    well as on our personnel. In addition, as a public company we
    are required to document and test our internal controls over
    financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can
    periodically certify as to the effectiveness of our internal
    controls over financial reporting. As a result, we have been
    required to improve our financial and managerial controls,
    reporting systems and procedures and have incurred and will
    continue to incur expenses to test our systems and to make such
    improvements. If our management is unable to certify the
    effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent
    registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls
    are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a
    loss of public confidence, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business and our stock price. In addition, if we
    do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel,
    processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately report
    our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a
    decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to
    raise capital.

The
    market price for our common stock may be volatile, and an
    investor may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price
    or at all.

The market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate
    significantly from time to time in response to factors including:

•

differences between our actual financial and operating results
    and those expected by investors;

•

fluctuations in quarterly operating results;

•

our performance during peak retail seasons such as the holiday
    season;

•

market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole;

•

changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes
    in recommendations by any research analysts that follow our
    stock or any failure to meet the estimates made by research
    analysts;

•

investors’ perceptions of our prospects and the prospects
    of the beauty products and salon services industries;

•

the performance of our key vendors;

•

announcements by us, our vendors or our competitors of
    significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships,
    joint ventures or capital commitments;

•

introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us or
    by our competitors;

•

small trading volumes and small public float;

•

stock transactions by our principal stockholders;

•

recruitment or departure of key personnel; and

•

the level and quality of securities research analyst coverage
    for our common stock.

In addition, public announcements by our competitors, other
    retailers and vendors concerning, among other things, their
    performance, strategy, or accounting practices could cause the
    market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our
    actual operating performance.


Our
    comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance may
    fluctuate for a variety of reasons, which could result in a
    decline in the price of our common stock.

Our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations
    have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to
    fluctuate in the future. A variety of other factors affect our
    comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance,
    including:

•

general U.S. economic conditions and, in particular, the
    retail sales environment;

•

changes in our merchandising strategy or mix;

•

performance of our new and remodeled stores;

•

the effectiveness of our inventory management;

•

timing and concentration of new store openings, including
    additional human resource requirements and related pre-opening
    and other

start-up

costs;

•

cannibalization of existing store sales by new store openings;

•

levels of pre-opening expenses associated with new stores;

•

timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, such as
    catalogs and newspaper inserts;

•

seasonal fluctuations due to weather conditions; and

•

actions by our existing or new competitors.

Accordingly, our results for any one fiscal quarter are not
    necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any
    other quarter, and comparable store sales for any particular
    future period may decrease. In that event, the price of our
    common stock would likely decline. For more information on our
    quarterly results of operations, see Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Our
    current principal stockholders have significant influence over
    us and they could delay, deter, or prevent a change of control
    or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take
    action with which you might not agree.

Our principal stockholders own or control, in the aggregate,
    approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock. As a result,
    these stockholders will be able to exercise significant
    influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval,
    including the election of directors, amendment of our
    certificate of incorporation and approval of significant
    corporate transactions and will have significant influence over
    our management and policies. Such concentration of voting power
    could have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of
    control or other business combination that might otherwise be
    beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, the significant
    concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the
    trading price of our common stock because investors often
    perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with
    stockholders holding such significant influence.

Anti-takeover
    provisions in our organizational documents, stockholder rights
    agreement and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in
    control, even if a sale of the Company would be beneficial to
    our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline
    and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove
    our current management.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
    by-laws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in
    control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of
    our common stock and harm the market price of our common stock
    and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our
    common stock. These provisions include:

•

dividing our board of directors into three classes serving
    staggered three-year terms;


•

authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock and
    additional shares of our common stock without stockholder
    approval;

•

prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent;

•

prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of
    stockholders;

•

prohibiting our stockholders from making certain changes to our
    amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and
    restated bylaws except with a two-thirds majority stockholder
    approval; and

•

requiring advance notice for raising business matters or
    nominating directors at stockholders’ meetings.

As permitted by our amended and restated certificate of
    incorporation and by-laws, we have a stockholder rights
    agreement, sometimes known as a “poison pill,” which
    provides for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to
    holders of common stock. In the event of a takeover attempt,
    this preferred stock gives rights to holders of common stock
    other than the acquirer to buy additional shares of common stock
    at a discount, leading to the dilution of the acquirer’s
    stake.

We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that, in
    general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial
    owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years after
    the stockholder becomes a 15% stockholder, subject to specified
    exceptions. Together, these provisions of our certificate of
    incorporation, by-laws and stockholder rights agreement and of
    Delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult
    and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve
    payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our
    common stock.

Properties

All of our retail stores, corporate offices and distribution and
    warehouse facilities are leased or subleased. Our retail stores
    are conveniently located in high-traffic, primarily off-mall
    locations such as power centers and lifestyle centers with other
    destination retailers. Our typical store is approximately
    10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square
    feet dedicated to our full-service salon. Most of our retail
    store leases provide for a fixed minimum annual rent and have a
    fixed term with options for two or three extension periods of
    five years each, exercisable at our option. As of
    January 30, 2010, we operated 346 retail stores in
    38 states, as shown in the table below:

As of January 30, 2010, we operated two distribution
    facilitates located in Romeoville, Illinois and Phoenix,
    Arizona. The Romeoville warehouse contains approximately
    317,000 square feet, including an overflow facility. The
    lease for the Romeoville warehouse expires on April 30,
    2015 and has one renewal option with a term of five years. The
    Phoenix warehouse contains approximately 330,000 square
    feet. The lease for the Phoenix warehouse expires on
    March 31, 2019 and has three renewal options with terms of
    five years each.

We have corporate offices in two separate locations. Our
    principal executive office is in Bolingbrook, Illinois and our
    secondary corporate office is in Romeoville, Illinois, on the
    site of the Romeoville warehouse. The lease for the Bolingbrook
    office expires on August 31, 2018 and the lease for the
    Romeoville office expires on April 30, 2015. We have
    secured additional office space in Bolingbrook, Illinois for
    corporate use to accommodate future human resource requirements
    over the next several years.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Securities litigation —

In December 2007 and
    January 2008, three putative securities class action lawsuits
    were filed against us and certain of our current and
    then-current executive officers in the United States District
    Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Each suit alleged
    that the prospectus and registration statement filed pursuant to
    our initial public offering contained materially false and
    misleading statements and failed to disclose material facts.
    Each suit claimed violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2)

and/or

15 of
    the Securities Act of 1933, and the two later filed suits added
    claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the associated

Rule 10b-5.

In February 2008, two of the plaintiffs filed competing motions
    to consolidate the actions and appoint lead plaintiffs and lead
    plaintiffs’ counsel. On March 18, 2008, after one of
    the plaintiffs withdrew his motion, the suits were consolidated
    and plaintiffs in the Mirsky v. ULTA action were appointed
    lead plaintiffs. Lead plaintiffs filed their amended complaint
    on May 19, 2008. The amended complaint alleged no new
    violations of the securities laws not asserted in the prior
    complaints. It added no new defendants and dropped one of the
    then-current officers as a defendant. On July 21, 2008,
    defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On
    September 24, 2008, lead plaintiffs filed their opposition
    to the motion to dismiss, and on October 24, 2008,
    defendants filed their reply memorandum in support of their
    motion to dismiss. On March 19, 2009, defendants’
    motion to dismiss was denied.

On May 29, 2009, we and our primary insurance carrier
    engaged in a mediation with counsel representing the putative
    class. Although we continue to deny plaintiffs’
    allegations, in the interest of putting this matter behind us,
    we and our insurer reached a settlement with plaintiffs. On
    August 7, 2009, the Court entered an order preliminarily
    approving the settlement, approving the form and manner of
    notice to putative class members, and setting a final hearing to
    determine whether to approve the settlement. On
    November 16, 2009, the Court held a final hearing and, no
    class members having objected to the settlement or having
    requested exclusion from the settlement class, the Court entered
    a final order dismissing all three consolidated cases with
    prejudice. The time for appeal expired on December 16, 2009
    without any appeal or other challenge to the judgment being
    made. All amounts paid under the settlement have been paid out
    of proceeds of our directors and officers liability insurance
    coverage.

General litigation —

In July 2009, a putative
    employment class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain
    unnamed defendants in State Court in California. The suit
    alleges that Ulta misclassified its store General Managers and
    Salon Managers as exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act and
    California Labor Code. The suit seeks to recover damages and
    penalties as a result of this alleged misclassification. On
    August 27, 2009, we filed our answer to the lawsuit, and on
    August 31, 2009 we moved the action to the United States
    District Court for the Northern District of California. On
    November 2, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint
    adding another named plaintiff. Although we believe that we have
    meritorious defenses to the claims made in the putative class
    action and intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously, an adverse
    resolution could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position and results of operations in the period in which the
    lawsuit is resolved. We are not presently able to reasonably
    estimate potential losses, if any, related to the lawsuit.

We are also involved in various legal proceedings that are
    incidental to the conduct of our business. In the opinion of
    management, the amount of any liability with respect to these
    proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not
    be material.

Holders
    of the Registrant’s Common Stock

The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ
    Global Select Market on March 25, 2010 was $22.72 per
    share. As of March 25, 2010, we had 181 holders of record
    of our common stock. Because many shares of common stock are
    held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of
    stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of
    stockholders represented by these record holders.

Dividends

No cash dividends have been declared on our common stock to date
    nor have any decisions been made to pay a dividend in the
    foreseeable future. We evaluate our dividend policy on a
    periodic basis. Any dividend we might declare in the future
    would be subject to the applicable provisions of our credit
    agreement, which currently restricts our ability to pay cash
    dividends.

    Performance Graph

The following performance graph and related information shall
    not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the SEC, nor shall such information be
    incorporated by reference into any future filing under the
    Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each
    as amended, except to the extent that we specifically
    incorporate it by reference into such filing.

Set forth below is a graph comparing the cumulative total
    stockholder return on Ulta’s common stock with the NASDAQ
    Global Select Market Composite Index (NQGS) and the S&P
    Retail Index (RLX) for the period covering Ulta’s first
    trading day on October 25, 2007 through the end of
    Ulta’s fiscal year ended January 30, 2010. The graph
    assumes an investment of $100 made at the closing of trading on
    October 25, 2007, in (i) Ulta’s common stock,
    (ii) the stocks comprising the NQGS, and (iii) stocks
    comprising the RLX. All values assume reinvestment of the full
    amount of all dividends, if any, into additional shares of the
    same class of equity securities at the frequency with which
    dividends are paid on such securities during the applicable time
    period.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with our financial statements and related notes
    included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 and the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
    Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which reflect our current views
    with respect to, among other things, future events and financial
    performance. You can identify these forward-looking statements
    by the use of forward-looking words such as “outlook,”
    “believes,” “expects,” “plans,”
    “estimates,” or other comparable words. Any
    forward-looking statements contained in this

Form 10-K

are based upon our historical performance and on current plans,
    estimates and expectations. The inclusion of this

    of material disruptions to our information systems; weather
    conditions that could negatively impact sales; and other risk
    factors detailed in our public filings with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including risk
    factors contained in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended January 30, 2010. We assume no
    obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result
    of new information, future events or developments. References in
    the following discussion to “we”, “us”,
    “our”, “the Company”, “Ulta” and
    similar references mean Ulta Salon, Cosmetics &
    Fragrance, Inc. unless otherwise expressly stated or the context
    otherwise requires.

Overview

We were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time
    when prestige, mass and salon products were sold through
    separate distribution channels. In 1999 we embarked on a
    multi-year strategy to understand and embrace what women want in
    a beauty retailer and transform Ulta into the shopping
    experience that it is


today. We pioneered what we believe to be our unique combination
    of beauty superstore and specialty store attributes. We believe
    our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that
    have contributed to our strong financial performance.

We are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides
    one-stop shopping for prestige, mass and salon products and
    salon services in the United States. We combine the unique
    elements of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment
    and experience of a specialty retailer. Key aspects of our
    beauty superstore strategy include our ability to offer our
    customers a broad selection of over 21,000 beauty products
    across the categories of cosmetics, fragrance, haircare,
    skincare, bath and body products and salon styling tools, as
    well as salon haircare products. We focus on delivering a
    compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our
    product categories. Our stores are conveniently located in
    high-traffic, primarily off-mall locations such as power centers
    and lifestyle centers with other destination retailers. As of
    January 30, 2010, we operated 346 stores across
    38 states. In addition to these fundamental elements of a
    beauty superstore, we strive to offer an uplifting shopping
    experience through what we refer to as “The Five
    E’s”: Escape, Education, Entertainment, Esthetics and
    Empowerment.

The continued growth of our business and any future increases in
    net sales, net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability
    to execute our growth strategy, including growing our store
    base, expanding our prestige brand offerings, driving
    incremental salon traffic, expanding our online business and
    continuing to enhance our brand awareness. We believe that the
    steadily expanding U.S. beauty products and services
    industry, the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products
    from department stores to specialty retail stores, coupled with
    Ulta’s competitive strengths, positions us to capture
    additional market share in the industry through successful
    execution of our growth strategy.

Comparable store sales is a key metric that is monitored closely
    within the retail industry. We do not expect our comparable
    store sales increases over the next five years to reflect the
    sustained high single digit to low double digit increases we
    experienced in 2005 through early 2007. We believe the
    sequential decline in our quarterly comparable store sales
    during 2008 and the comparable store sales declines in first and
    second quarter 2009 were due primarily to the difficult economic
    environment. While we have experienced some level of
    stabilization in our comparable store sales during the course of
    2009, and recorded a positive comparable store sales increase in
    the third and fourth quarters of 2009, the continuing economic
    uncertainty may impact the level of comparable store sales we
    can achieve.

The Company adopted a structured stock option compensation
    program in July 2007. The award of stock options under this
    program will result in increased stock-based compensation
    expense in future periods as compared to the expense reflected
    in our historical financial statements.

Over the long-term, our growth strategy is to increase total net
    sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by
    opening new stores. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is
    expected to increase as a result of our ability to leverage our
    supply chain infrastructure and fixed store costs with
    comparable store sales increases. We plan to continue to improve
    our operating results by leveraging our fixed costs and
    decreasing our selling, general and administrative expenses, as
    a percentage of our net sales.

On October 30, 2007, we completed an initial public
    offering in which we sold 7,666,667 shares of common stock
    resulting in net proceeds of $123.5 million after deducting
    underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
    Selling stockholders sold 2,153,928 additional shares of common
    stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares
    by the selling stockholders. We used the net proceeds from the
    offering to pay $93.0 million of accumulated dividends in
    arrears on our preferred stock, which satisfied all amounts due
    with respect to accumulated dividends, $4.8 million to
    redeem our Series III preferred stock, and
    $25.7 million to reduce our borrowings under our third
    amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general
    corporate purposes. Also in connection with the offering, we
    converted preferred shares into 41,524,002 common shares and
    restated the par value of our common stock to $0.01 per share.


Global
    economic conditions

The global economic crisis and the continued volatility and
    disruption to the capital and credit markets have had a
    significant, adverse impact on global economic conditions,
    resulting in additional significant recessionary pressures and
    declines in consumer confidence and economic growth. As a result
    of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit
    has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid
    credit markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the
    stability of the markets generally and the strength of
    counterparties specifically has led many lenders and
    institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to
    provide credit to businesses and consumers. These factors have
    led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike,
    and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending.
    Continued turbulence in the United States and international
    markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and
    consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and
    financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition
    of our customers, including our ability to refinance maturing
    liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity
    needs.

Current
    business trends

During fiscal 2008, we experienced a deceleration of our
    comparable store sales increases. Our comparable store increases
    for the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal 2008 were
    3.9%, 3.7%, and 2.0%, respectively. The deceleration was
    especially apparent during the fourth quarter when we reported a
    comparable store sales decrease of 5.5%. We believe that the
    deterioration of the U.S. economy was the primary
    contributing factor to our comparable store sales deceleration
    throughout fiscal 2008.

During fiscal 2009, we experienced a sequential improvement in
    our comparable store sales. Comparables store sales for the
    first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 were
    -2.3%, -1.7%, 1.5% and 6.2%, respectively. We believe the
    improvement in our comparable store sales trends is due to a
    combination of factors including our ability to better plan our
    marketing and merchandise programs for the challenging economic
    environment and the relatively lower comparable in the prior
    year fourth quarter period. We also believe that overall
    consumer sentiment and shopping patterns improved somewhat in
    the second half of 2009 which may have contributed to our
    improving trends when compared to 2008.

Basis of
    presentation

Net sales include store and

e-commerce

merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue. Salon
    service revenue represents less than 10% of our combined product
    sales and services revenues and therefore, these revenues are
    combined with product sales. We recognize merchandise revenue at
    the point of sale (POS) in our retail stores and the time of
    shipment in the case of Internet sales. Merchandise sales are
    recorded net of estimated returns. Salon service revenue is
    recognized at the time the service is provided. Gift card sales
    revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card.
    Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction
    of net sales.

Comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the
    first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a
    store is included in our comparable store base on the first day
    of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one
    month grand opening period. Non-comparable store sales include
    sales from new stores that have not yet completed their
    13th month of operation and stores that were closed for
    part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel
    activity. Remodeled stores are included in comparable store
    sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current
    or prior period.

E-commerce

merchandise sales are excluded from comparable store sales.
    There may be variations in the way in which some of our
    competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same
    store sales. As a result, data herein regarding our comparable
    store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available
    by our competitors or other retailers.


Comparable store sales is a critical measure that allows us to
    evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several
    other aspects of our overall strategy. Several factors could
    positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales
    results:

•

the general national, regional and local economic conditions and
    corresponding impact on customer spending levels;

•

the introduction of new products or brands;

•

the location of new stores in existing store markets;

•

competition;

•

our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer
    preferences;

•

the effectiveness of our various marketing activities; and

•

the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average
    age of all of our comparable stores.

Cost of sales includes:

•

the cost of merchandise sold, including all vendor allowances,
    which are treated as a reduction of merchandise costs;

•

warehousing and distribution costs including labor and related
    benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real
    estate taxes, utilities, and insurance;

•

store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and
    amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and
    maintenance, insurance, licenses, and cleaning expenses;

•

salon payroll and benefits;

•

customer loyalty program expense; and

•

shrink and inventory valuation reserves.

Our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an
    increasing number of stores. Changes in our merchandise mix may
    also have an impact on cost of sales. This presentation of items
    included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in
    which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of
    sales.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include:

•

payroll, bonus and benefit costs for retail and corporate
    employees;

•

advertising and marketing costs;

•

occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities;

•

stock-based compensation expense related to option grants which
    will result in increases in expense as we implemented a
    structured stock option compensation program in 2007;

•

depreciation and amortization for all assets except those
    related to our retail and warehouse operations, which is
    included in cost of sales; and

•

legal, finance, information systems and other corporate overhead
    costs.

This presentation of items in selling, general and
    administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in
    which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling,
    general and administrative expenses.

Pre-opening expense includes non-capital expenditures during the
    period prior to store opening for new and remodeled stores
    including rent during the construction period for new stores,
    store

set-up

labor, management and employee training, and grand opening
    advertising.

Interest expense includes interest costs associated with our
    credit facility, which is structured as an asset based lending
    instrument. Our interest expense will fluctuate based on the
    seasonal borrowing requirements


associated with acquiring inventory in advance of key holiday
    selling periods and fluctuation in the variable interest rates
    we are charged on outstanding balances. Our credit facility is
    used to fund seasonal inventory needs and new and remodel store
    capital requirements in excess of our cash flow from operations.
    Our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest
    rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of
    rising interest rates.

Income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and
    the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in
    which we operate stores.

Results

Fiscal
    year 2009 versus fiscal year 2008

Net
    sales

Net sales increased $138.2 million, or 12.7%, to
    $1,222.8 million in fiscal 2009 compared to
    $1,084.6 million in fiscal 2008. This increase is due to
    the opening of 35 net new stores in 2009 and a 1.4%
    increase in comparable store sales which was primarily due to a
    3.6% increase in store traffic. Non-comparable stores, which
    include stores opened in fiscal 2009 as well as stores opened in
    fiscal 2008 which have not yet turned comparable, contributed
    $123.3 million of the net sales increase while comparable
    stores contributed $14.9 million of the total net sales
    increase. Fiscal 2009 comparable store sales were positively
    affected by the 6.2% increase in comparable store sales in the
    fourth quarter. We believe the improvement in our comparable
    store sales trends is due to a combination of factors including
    our ability to better plan our marketing and merchandise
    programs for the challenging environment and the relatively
    lower comparable in the prior year fourth quarter period. We
    also believe that overall consumer sentiment and shopping
    patterns improved somewhat in the second half of 2009 which may
    have contributed to our improving trends when compared to 2008.

Gross
    profit

Gross profit increased $45.1 million, or 13.8%, to
    $373.0 million in fiscal 2009, compared to
    $327.9 million, in fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a
    percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points to 30.5%
    in fiscal 2009 compared to 30.2% in fiscal 2008. Gross profit in
    fiscal 2009 was impacted by:

•

a 70 basis point improvement due to supply chain
    efficiencies including labor and freight; offset by

•

40 basis points of deleverage of fixed store costs due to
    the impacts of our new store program; the level of fixed store
    costs deleverage improved during the course of fiscal 2009 as
    the rate of square footage growth slowed consistent with the
    decrease in our fiscal 2009 new store program as compared to
    fiscal 2008 and 2007.

Selling,
    general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses
    increased $31.6 million, or 11.8%, to $298.9 million
    in fiscal 2009 compared to $267.3 million in fiscal 2008.
    As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased
    20 basis points to 24.4% in fiscal 2009 compared to 24.6%
    in fiscal 2008. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was
    primarily impacted by:

•

a 40 basis point improvement in variable store expense
    leverage attributed to cost management strategies;

•

a 20 basis point improvement in marketing expense leverage
    attributed to improved cost efficiencies while total number of
    marketing impressions were maintained at historical levels;
    offset by

•

a 40 basis point deleverage of general corporate overhead
    which is attributed to a 90 basis point, or
    $11.6 million, increase in incentive compensation compared
    to the prior year.

Pre-opening
    expenses

Pre-opening expenses decreased $8.3 million, or 58.1%, to
    $6.0 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $14.3 million
    in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, we opened 37 new stores and
    remodeled 6 stores. During fiscal 2008, we opened 63 new stores
    and remodeled 8 stores.

Interest
    expense

Interest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 44.2%, to
    $2.2 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $3.9 million
    in fiscal 2008 primarily due to a $45 million decrease in
    the weighted-average debt outstanding on our variable rate
    credit facility during fiscal 2009.


Income
    tax expense

Income tax expense of $26.6 million in fiscal 2009
    represents an effective tax rate of 40.3%, compared to fiscal
    2008 tax expense of $17.1 million which represents an
    effective tax rate of 40.3%.

Net
    income

Net income increased $14.1 million, or 55.8%, to
    $39.4 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $25.3 million
    in fiscal 2008. The increase in net income was primarily due to
    an increase in gross profit of $45.1 million and a
    $8.3 million decrease in pre-opening expenses, which were
    offset by a $31.6 million increase in selling, general and
    administrative expenses and a $9.5 million increase in
    income tax expense.

Fiscal
    year 2008 versus fiscal year 2007

Net
    sales

Net sales increased $172.5 million, or 18.9%, to
    $1,084.6 million in fiscal 2008 compared to
    $912.1 million in fiscal 2007. This increase was due to the
    opening of 62 net new stores in 2008 and a 0.2% increase in
    comparable store sales. Non-comparable stores, which include
    stores opened in fiscal 2008 as well as stores opened in fiscal
    2007 which have not yet turned comparable, contributed
    $170.7 million of the net sales increase while comparable
    stores contributed $1.8 million of the total net sales
    increase. Fiscal 2008 comparable store sales were significantly
    affected by the 5.5% decrease in comparable store sales in the
    fourth quarter. We believe the continued deterioration and
    uncertainty in the United States economy were significant
    contributing factors to our decreased comparable store sales
    during fiscal 2008, especially during the holiday season when
    consumers significantly reduced discretionary spending.

Gross
    profit

Gross profit increased $44.3 million, or 15.6%, to
    $327.9 million in fiscal 2008, compared to
    $283.6 million, in fiscal 2007. Gross profit as a
    percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points to 30.2%
    in fiscal 2008 compared to 31.1% in fiscal 2007. Gross profit in
    fiscal 2008 was impacted by:

•

a 90 basis point deleverage of fixed store costs primarily
    driven by the acceleration of our new store program over the
    last two years;

•

a 20 basis point deleverage of distribution center costs
    due to one-time

start-up

costs and fixed on-going operating costs of our new Phoenix
    distribution center opened in the first quarter fiscal
    2008; and

•

a 20 basis point improvement in freight cost leverage due
    to an improved transportation network due to the addition of our
    new Phoenix distribution center and other cost management
    strategies.

Selling,
    general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses
    increased $42.1 million, or 18.7%, to $267.3 million
    in fiscal 2008 compared to $225.2 million in fiscal 2007.
    As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased
    10 basis points to 24.6% in fiscal 2008 compared to 24.7%
    in fiscal 2007. SG&A expenses were primarily impacted by:

•

operating expenses from new stores opened in fiscal 2008 and
    2007;

•

a 60 basis point improvement in leverage of corporate
    overhead and store variable costs, including a 40 basis
    point decrease in incentive compensation expense as compared to
    fiscal 2007;

•

a 40 basis point increase in marketing expense driven by an
    increased number of advertising vehicles and circulation to
    drive customer traffic in a weaker economic environment; and

•

a 20 basis point increase in stock compensation expense.


Pre-opening
    expenses

Pre-opening expenses increased $2.5 million, or 21.7%, to
    $14.3 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $11.8 million
    in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we opened 63 new stores and
    remodeled 8 stores. During fiscal 2007, we opened 53 new stores
    and remodeled 17 stores.

Interest
    expense

Interest expense decreased $0.6 million, or 13.2%, to
    $3.9 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $4.5 million
    in fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 200 basis point decrease
    in the weighted-average interest rate on our variable rate
    credit facility during fiscal 2008, partially offset by
    increased borrowings.

Income
    tax expense

Income tax expense of $17.1 million in fiscal 2008
    represents an effective tax rate of 40.3%, compared to fiscal
    2007 tax expense of $16.8 million which represents an
    effective tax rate of 39.9%. The increase in the effective tax
    rate is primarily due to an increase in non-deductible stock
    compensation expense.

Net
    income

Net income in fiscal 2008 was flat in comparison to fiscal 2007.
    Net income was impacted by an increase in gross profit of
    $44.3 million which was offset by increases in selling,
    general and administrative expenses and pre-opening expenses.

Liquidity
    and capital resources

Our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new,
    relocated and remodeled stores, increased merchandise
    inventories related to store expansion, and for continued
    improvement in our information technology systems.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations,
    including changes in working capital, and borrowings under our
    credit facility. The most significant component of our working
    capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts
    payable and accrued expenses. Our working capital position
    benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales
    to customers the same day, or within several days of the related
    sale, while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our
    vendors.

Our working capital needs are greatest from August through
    November each year as a result of our inventory

build-up

during this period for the approaching holiday season. This is
    also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels
    in our new store class and may not have collected all of the
    landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements.
    Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe
    that cash generated from operations and borrowings under the
    credit facility will satisfy the Company’s working capital
    needs, capital expenditure needs, commitments, and other
    liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months.

On October 30, 2007, we completed an initial public
    offering in which we sold 7,666,667 shares of common stock
    to the public at a price of $18.00 per share resulting in
    aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock
    of $138.0 million. Selling stockholders sold 2,153,928
    additional shares of common stock. We did not receive any
    proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.
    The aggregate net proceeds to us were $123.5 million after
    deducting $9.7 million in underwriting discounts and
    commissions and $4.7 million in offering expenses. We used
    the net proceeds from the offering to pay $93.0 million of
    accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock, which
    satisfied all amounts due with respect to accumulated dividends,
    $4.8 million to redeem our Series III preferred stock,
    and $25.7 million to reduce our borrowings under our third
    amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general
    corporate purposes. Also in connection with the offering, we
    converted preferred shares into 41,524,002 common shares and
    restated the par value of our common stock to $0.01 per share.


The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for
    fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007:

Operating
    activities

Operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain
    non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization,
    non-cash stock-based compensation, excess tax benefits from
    stock-based compensation, realized gains or losses on disposal
    of property and equipment, and the effect of working capital
    changes.

Merchandise inventories were $206.9 million at
    January 30, 2010, compared to $213.6 million at
    January 31, 2009, representing a decrease of
    $6.7 million. The decrease is due to a 12.9% decrease in
    average inventory per store driven by management initiatives
    focused on leveraging supply chain inventories, offset by the
    addition of 35 net new stores opened since January 31,
    2009. The reduction in inventories in fiscal 2009 did not affect
    our store in-stock levels or the customer experience.

Accrued income taxes were $10.8 million at January 30,
    2010, compared to a prepaid income taxes position of
    $8.6 million at January 31, 2009. We received an
    $8.0 million income tax refund in May 2009, related to
    certain tax planning changes adopted in fiscal 2008.

Deferred rent liabilities were $113.7 million at
    January 30, 2010, an increase of $12.4 million
    compared to the prior year end. Deferred rent includes deferred
    construction allowances, future rental increases and rent
    holidays which are all recognized on a straight-line basis over
    their respective lease term. The increase is due to fiscal 2009
    activity which includes 35 net new stores.

Investing
    activities

We have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled
    stores as well as investments in information technology systems.
    Investment activities primarily related to capital expenditures
    were $68.1 million in fiscal 2009, compared to
    $110.9 million and $101.9 million in fiscal 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Capital expenditures were lower during
    fiscal 2009 due to the reduction in our 2009 new store program.
    During fiscal 2009 we opened 37 new stores, compared to 63 new
    stores and a new distribution center during fiscal 2008 and 53
    new stores during fiscal 2007.

During fiscal 2006, our Chief Executive Officer exercised stock
    options in exchange for a promissory note for $4.1 million.
    The Company withheld $2.4 million of payroll-related taxes
    in connection with the exercised options and that portion of the
    note has been classified as an investing activity in fiscal
    2006. The remainder of the promissory note of $1.7 million
    related to exercise proceeds of the options and was classified
    as a non-cash financing activity. The note was paid in full on
    June 29, 2007.

Financing
    activities

Financing activities consist principally of draws and payments
    on our credit facility and capital stock transactions. The
    increase in cash used in financing activities of
    $139.8 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 is
    primarily the result of $56.3 million less in proceeds from
    long-term borrowings and $81.0 million more in payments on
    long-term borrowings. The remaining difference is related to
    capital stock transactions.

We had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at
    the end of fiscal 2009. The zero outstanding borrowings position
    is due to a combination of factors including stronger than
    expected sales growth, overall


performance of management initiatives including expense control
    as well as inventory and other working capital reductions, and a
    planned reduction in our fiscal 2009 new store program. While we
    expect the level of borrowings under the facility will be lower
    than historical amounts, we expect that we will require
    borrowings under the facility from time to time in future
    periods to support our new store program and seasonal inventory
    needs.

Credit
    facility

Our credit facility is with Bank of America National Association
    as the administrative agent, Wachovia Capital Finance
    Corporation as collateral agent, and JP Morgan Chase Bank as
    documentation agent. This facility provides maximum credit of
    $200 million through May 31, 2011. The facility
    provides maximum borrowings equal to the lesser of
    $200 million or a percentage of eligible owned inventory.
    The advance rates on owned inventory are 80% (85% from September
    1 to January 31). The credit facility agreement contains a
    restrictive financial covenant requiring us to maintain tangible
    net worth of not less than $80 million. On January 30,
    2010, our tangible net worth was approximately
    $293 million. Substantially all of our assets are pledged
    as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the facility.
    Outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or the
    Eurodollar rate plus 1.00% up to $100 million and 1.25%
    thereafter.

We had no outstanding borrowings under the facility as of
    January 30, 2010. We had $106.0 million of outstanding
    borrowings under the facility as of January 31, 2009, with
    a weighted-average interest rate of 1.52%. We had approximately
    $196.9 million and $86.8 million of availability as of
    January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively.
    We also had a letter of credit that expired in September 2009;
    the balance was $0.3 million as of January 31, 2009.

Seasonality

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant
    portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the
    fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling
    season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by
    Mothers’ Day as well as the “Back to School”
    season and Valentines’ Day. Any decrease in sales during
    these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition, or operating results for
    the entire fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations have
    varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future.
    As such, we believe that

period-to-period

comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied
    upon as an indication of our future performance.

Impact of
    inflation and changing prices

Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material
    impact on our financial position or results of operations to
    date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse
    effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin
    and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage
    of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not
    increase with these increased costs. In addition, inflation
    could materially increase the interest rates on our debt.

Off-balance
    sheet arrangements

Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease
    obligations and letters of credit. We do not have any
    non-cancelable purchase commitments as of January 30, 2010.
    Our letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit
    facility expired in September 2009; the balance was
    $0.3 million as of January 31, 2009.

Contractual
    obligations

We lease retail stores, warehouses, corporate offices and
    certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration
    dates through fiscal 2024. Our store leases generally have
    initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options
    under substantially the same terms and conditions as the
    original leases. In addition to future minimum lease payments,
    most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions
    which we recognize straight-line over the term of the lease,
    including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable. For
    certain locations, we receive cash tenant allowances and we
    report these amounts as deferred rent, which is amortized


on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the
    term of the lease, including any lease renewal periods deemed to
    be probable. While a number of our store leases include
    contingent rentals, contingent rent amounts are insignificant.

The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and
    the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have
    on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. The table
    below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent,
    common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. The
    table below includes obligations for executed agreements for
    which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the
    property as of January 30, 2010:

    maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes for fiscal 2009
    were $20.9 million.

Critical
    accounting policies and estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition
    and results of operations is based upon our financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP). The
    preparation of these financial statements required the use of
    estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases
    estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it
    believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates
    these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ
    from these estimates. A discussion of our more significant
    estimates follows. Management has discussed the development,
    selection, and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions
    with the audit committee of the board of directors.

Inventory
    valuation

Merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost
    or market value. Cost is determined using the weighted-average
    cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and
    distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including
    co-op advertising, markdowns, and volume discounts. We record
    valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a
    specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize
    from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These
    estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding
    future demand, age of inventory, and analysis of historical
    experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different
    than those projected by management, future merchandise margin
    rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to
    these estimates.

Inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical
    inventory counts at each of our locations. We record a shrink
    reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory
    losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last
    physical count. This estimate is based on management’s
    analysis of historical results and operating trends. Adjustments
    to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s
    estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves
    have been insignificant during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Self-insurance

We are self-insured for certain losses related to health,
    workers’ compensation, and general liability insurance. We
    maintain stop loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit
    our liability exposure. Current stop loss coverage is $150,000
    for health claims, $100,000 for general liability claims, and
    $250,000 for workers’ compensation claims. Management
    estimates undiscounted loss reserves associated with these
    liabilities in part by considering historical claims experience,
    industry factors, and other actuarial assumptions including
    information provided by third parties. Self-insurance reserves
    for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $1.6 million,
    $1.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively.
    Adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to
    management’s estimates of these reserves were insignificant
    for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007.


Impairment
    of long-lived tangible assets

We review long-lived tangible assets whenever events or
    circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable
    based on undiscounted future cash flows. Assets are reviewed at
    the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified, which
    is the store level. Significant estimates are used in
    determining future operating results of each store over its
    remaining lease term. If such assets are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
    fair value of the assets. We have not recorded an impairment
    charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying
    financial statements.

Share-based
    compensation

We account for share-based compensation in accordance with the
    Accounting Standards
    Codification

tm

(ASC) rules for stock compensation. Share-based compensation
    cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the
    award, and is recognized on a straight-line method over the
    requisite service period for awards expected to vest.

We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a
    Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected volatility is based
    on volatilities of our stock and a peer group of publicly-traded
    companies. The risk free interest rate is based on the United
    States Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for
    the respective expected life of the option. The expected life
    represents the time the options granted are expected to be
    outstanding. We have limited historical data related to exercise
    behavior since our initial public offering on October 30,
    2007. As a result, we have elected to use the shortcut approach
    to determine the expected life in accordance with the SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin on share-based payments.

See notes to financial statements, “Summary of significant
    accounting policies — Share-based compensation,”
    for disclosure related to the Company’s stock compensation
    expense and related valuation model assumptions. See
    Note 10 to our financial statements, “Share-based
    awards,” for disclosure related to our stock compensation
    expense and related valuation model assumptions.

Recent
    accounting pronouncements

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued the ASC as the single source of authoritative accounting
    principles recognized by the FASB to be applied in the
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The
    ASC also recognizes rules and interpretive releases of the SEC
    under federal securities laws as authoritative GAAP for SEC
    registrants. The ASC is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years and interim periods ending after
    September 15, 2009. We adopted the ASC in the third quarter
    of 2009 and it did not have any impact on our financial position
    or results of operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our
    financial position due to adverse changes in financial market
    prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the
    result of fluctuations in interest rates. We do not hold or
    issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest
    rate sensitivity

We are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through
    borrowing under our credit facility. Interest on our borrowings
    is based upon variable rates. On January 31, 2007, we
    entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional
    amount of $25,000 that qualified as a cash flow hedge to obtain
    a fixed interest rate on variable rate debt and reduce certain
    exposures to interest rate fluctuations. The swap resulted in
    fixed rate payments at an interest rate of 5.11% for a term of
    three years, ending on January 31, 2010.

As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, the
    interest rate swap had a negative fair value of zero and
    $1.0 million, respectively, and is included in accrued
    liabilities. The change in market value during fiscal 2009 and
    2008 related to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge was
    recorded as an unrecognized gain or loss


in the accumulated other comprehensive loss section of
    stockholders’ equity in the balance sheets. Amounts related
    to any ineffectiveness, which are insignificant, are recorded as
    interest expense.

Our weighted average debt for fiscal 2009 was
    $37.6 million, adjusted to exclude the $25.0 million
    hedged amount. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in
    interest rates would have resulted in a $0.4 million change
    to our interest expense for fiscal 2009.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures over
    Financial Reporting

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
    that material information relating to the Company is made known
    to the officers who certify our financial reports and to the
    members of our senior management and board of directors.

Based on management’s evaluation as of January 30,
    2010, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
    have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to
    ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in
    our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
    Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
    designed by, or under the supervision of the principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer and effected by the
    board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    principal executive officer and our principal financial officer,
    management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control
    over financial reporting as of January 30, 2010, based on
    the criteria established in “Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
    evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer concluded that our internal controls over
    financial reporting were effective as of January 30, 2010.
    Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited our financial statements included
    in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of January 30, 2010 and has issued
    the attestation report included in Item 15 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to our internal controls over financial
    reporting during the three months ended January 30, 2010
    that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal controls over financial
    reporting.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Ulta Salon,
    Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. (the Company) as of
    January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, and the related
    statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity
    for each of the three years in the period ended January 30,
    2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. at
    January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, and the results
    of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended January 30, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Ulta
    Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2010,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    March 31, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.

We have audited Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance,
    Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    January 30, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
    criteria). Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance,
    Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2010,
    based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    balance sheets of Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance,
    Inc. as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, and
    the related statements of income, cash flows and
    stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the
    period ended January 30, 2010 and our report dated
    March 31, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Financial Statements

(In thousands, except per share data)

1.

Business
    and basis of presentation

Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. (Company or
    Ulta) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on
    January 9, 1990, to operate specialty retail stores selling
    cosmetics, fragrance, haircare and skincare products, and
    related accessories and services. The stores also feature
    full-service salons. As of January 30, 2010, the Company
    operated 346 stores in 38 states. All amounts are stated in
    thousands, with the exception of per share amounts and number of
    stores.

Reverse
    stock split

On September 17, 2007, the Company’s board of
    directors approved a resolution to effect a reverse stock split
    of the Company’s common stock pursuant to which each share
    of common stock was to be converted into 0.632 of one share of
    common stock. The reverse stock split became effective on
    October 22, 2007. Any fractional shares resulting from the
    reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share.
    Common share and per share amounts for all periods presented and
    the conversion ratio of preferred to common shares have been
    adjusted for the 0.632 for 1 reverse stock split.

Initial
    public offering

On October 30, 2007, the Company completed an initial
    public offering in which the Company sold 7,667 shares of
    common stock resulting in net proceeds of $123,549 after
    deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering
    expenses. Selling stockholders sold approximately 2,154
    additional shares of common stock. The Company did not receive
    any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
    stockholders. The Company used the net proceeds from the
    offering to pay $93,012 of accumulated dividends in arrears on
    the Company’s preferred stock, which satisfied all amounts
    due with respect to accumulated dividends, $4,792 to redeem the
    Company’s Series III preferred stock, and $25,745 to
    reduce the Company’s borrowings under its third amended and
    restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate
    purposes. Also in connection with the offering, the Company
    converted preferred shares into 41,524 common shares and
    restated the par value of its common stock to $0.01 per share.

2.

    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
    date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the accounting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
    and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid
    investments with maturities of three months or less from the
    date of purchase. Cash equivalents include third-party credit
    card receivables because such amounts generally convert to cash
    within one to three days with little or no default risk.

Receivables

Receivables consist principally of amounts receivable from
    vendors related to allowances earned but not yet received. These
    receivables are computed based on provisions of the vendor
    agreements in place and the Company’s completed
    performance. The Company’s vendors are primarily

U.S.-based

producers of consumer products. The Company does not require
    collateral on its receivables and does not accrue interest.
    Credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to the
    diversity of vendors comprising the Company’s vendor base.
    The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its vendors
    and evaluates the collectability of its receivables based on the
    length of time the receivable is past due and historical
    experience. The allowance for receivables totaled $489 and $296
    as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009,
    respectively.

Merchandise
    inventories

Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
    market. Cost is determined using the weighted-average cost
    method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute
    goods. Inventory cost also includes vendor allowances related to
    co-op advertising, markdowns, and volume discounts. The Company
    maintains reserves for lower of cost or market and shrinkage.

Fair
    value of financial instruments

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, and accounts payable approximates their estimated
    fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments.
    The estimated fair value of the Company’s variable rate
    debt at January 31, 2009 approximates its carrying value
    since the rate of interest on the variable rate debt is revised
    frequently based upon the current prime rate or the Eurodollar
    rate.

Derivative
    financial instruments

The Company had an interest rate swap that expired on
    January 31, 2010. This derivative financial instrument was
    designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, the
    effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
    instrument was reported as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into interest
    expense in the same period or periods during which the hedged
    transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss, the
    ineffective portion, on the derivative instrument, if other than
    inconsequential, was recognized in interest expense during the
    period of change. This derivative was recorded in the
    January 31, 2009 balance sheet at fair value.

Property
    and equipment

The Company’s property and equipment are stated at cost net
    of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and
    repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. The
    Company’s assets are depreciated or amortized using the
    straight-line method, over the shorter of their estimated useful
    lives or the expected lease term as follows:

Equipment and fixtures

3 to 10 years

Leasehold improvements

10 years

Electronic equipment and software

3 to 5 years

The Company capitalizes costs incurred during the application
    development stage in developing or obtaining internal use
    software. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful
    life of the software. The Company also capitalizes interest
    related to construction projects and depreciates that amount
    over the lives of the related assets.

The Company periodically evaluates whether changes have occurred
    that would require revision of the remaining useful life of
    equipment and leasehold improvements or render them not
    recoverable. If such circumstances arise, the Company uses an
    estimate of the undiscounted sum of expected future operating
    cash


Ulta
    Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.

Notes to Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

flows during their holding period to determine whether the
    long-lived assets are impaired. If the aggregate undiscounted
    cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, the
    resulting impairment charges to be recorded are calculated based
    on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the fair
    value of such assets, with the fair value determined based on an
    estimate of discounted future cash flows.

Customer
    loyalty program

The Company maintains two customer loyalty programs. The
    Company’s national program provides reward point
    certificates for free beauty products. Customers earn
    purchase-based reward points and redeem the related reward
    certificate during specific promotional periods during the year.
    The Company is also piloting a loyalty program in several
    markets in which customers earn purchase-based points on an
    annual basis which can be redeemed at any time. The Company
    accrues the anticipated redemptions related to these programs at
    the time of the initial purchase based on historical experience.
    The accrued liability related to both of the loyalty programs at
    January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 was $3,784 and
    $3,309, respectively. The cost of these programs, which was
    $10,015, $9,002 and $8,167 in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, is included in cost of sales in the statements of
    income.

Deferred
    rent

Many of the Company’s operating leases contain
    predetermined fixed increases of the minimum rental rate during
    the lease. For these leases, the Company recognizes the related
    rental expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease
    term, including cancelable option periods where failure to
    exercise such options would result in an economic penalty, and
    records the difference between the amounts charged to expense
    and the rent paid as deferred rent. The lease term commences on
    the earlier of the date when the Company becomes legally
    obligated for rent payments or the date the Company takes
    possession of the leased space.

As part of many lease agreements, the Company receives
    construction allowances from landlords for tenant improvements.
    These leasehold improvements made by the Company are capitalized
    and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives
    or the lease term. The construction allowances are recorded as
    deferred rent and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
    lease term as a reduction of rent expense.

Revenue
    recognition

Net sales include merchandise sales and salon service revenue.
    Revenue from merchandise sales at stores is recognized at the
    time of sale, net of estimated returns.

E-commerce

sales are recorded upon the shipment of merchandise. Salon
    revenue is recognized when services are rendered. Revenues from
    gift cards are deferred and recognized when redeemed. Company
    coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net
    sales. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as the
    Company considers itself a pass-through conduit for collecting
    and remitting state sales tax.

Vendor
    allowances

The Company receives allowances from vendors in the normal
    course of business including advertising and markdown
    allowances, purchase volume discounts and rebates, and
    reimbursement for defective merchandise, and certain selling and
    display expenses. Substantially all vendor allowances are
    recorded as a reduction of the vendor’s product cost and
    are recognized in cost of sales as the product is sold.

Advertising

Advertising expense consists principally of paper, print, and
    distribution costs related to the Company’s advertising
    circulars. The Company expenses the production and distribution
    costs related to its advertising circulars in the period the
    related promotional event occurs. Total advertising costs,
    exclusive of incentives from vendors and

start-up

advertising expense, amounted to $76,811, $70,804 and $56,107
    for fiscal 2009,


Ulta
    Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.

Notes to Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

2008 and 2007, respectively. Prepaid advertising costs included
    in prepaid expenses and other current assets were $4,000 and
    $3,289 as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009,
    respectively.

Pre-opening
    expenses

Non-capital expenditures incurred prior to the grand opening of
    a new store are charged against earnings as incurred.

Cost
    of sales

Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold including
    all vendor allowances, which are treated as a reduction of
    merchandise costs; warehousing and distribution costs including
    labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and
    amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance; store
    occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization,
    real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance,
    insurance, licenses, and cleaning expenses; salon payroll and
    benefits; customer loyalty program expense; and shrink and
    inventory valuation reserves.

Selling,
    general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses includes payroll,
    bonus, and benefit costs for retail and corporate employees;
    advertising and marketing costs; occupancy costs related to our
    corporate office facilities; public company expense including
    Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expenses; stock-based compensation
    expense; depreciation and amortization for all assets except
    those related to our retail and warehouse operations which is
    included in cost of sales; and legal, finance, information
    systems and other corporate overhead costs.

Income
    taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the
    amounts used for income tax purposes and the amounts reported
    were derived using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year
    the differences are expected to reverse.

Income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions are
    recognized only when it is more likely than not that the tax
    position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
    authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits
    of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position
    will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full
    knowledge of all relevant information. Penalties and interest
    related to unrecognized tax positions are recorded in income tax
    expense. Although the Company believes that its estimates are
    reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.

Share-based
    compensation

The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance
    with the Accounting Standards
    Codification

tm

(ASC) rules for stock compensation. Share-based compensation
    cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the
    award, and is recognized on a straight-line method over the
    requisite service period for awards expected to vest. The
    Company recorded stock compensation expense of $5,949, $3,877
    and $2,283 for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively (see
    Note 10, “Share-based awards”).

Self-insurance

The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to
    employee health and workers’ compensation although stop
    loss coverage with third-party insurers is maintained to limit
    the Company’s liability exposure. Liabilities associated
    with these losses are estimated in part by considering
    historical claims experience, industry factors,


Ulta
    Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.

Notes to Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

severity factors, and actuarial assumptions. Should a different
    amount of liabilities develop compared to what was estimated,
    reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly in future periods.

Net
    income per common share

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
    of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
    net income per share includes dilutive common stock equivalents,
    using the treasury stock method, and in fiscal 2007 assumes that
    the convertible preferred shares outstanding were converted,
    with related preferred stock dividend requirements and
    outstanding common shares adjusted accordingly, except when the
    effect would be anti-dilutive.

Recent
    accounting pronouncements

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued the ASC as the single source of authoritative accounting
    principles recognized by the FASB to be applied in the
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The
    ASC also recognizes rules and interpretive releases of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under federal
    securities laws as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The
    ASC is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
    years and interim periods ending after September 15, 2009.
    The Company adopted the ASC in the third quarter of 2009 and it
    did not have any impact on its financial position or results of
    operations.

Commitments

Leases —

The Company leases retail stores,
    distribution and office facilities, and certain equipment.
    Original non-cancelable lease terms range from three to ten
    years, and store leases generally contain renewal options for
    additional years. A number of the Company’s store leases
    provide for contingent rentals based upon sales. Contingent rent
    amounts were insignificant in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. Total
    rent expense under operating

Securities litigation —

In December 2007 and
    January 2008, three putative securities class action lawsuits
    were filed against the Company and certain of its current and
    then-current executive officers in the United States District
    Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Each suit alleged
    that the prospectus and registration statement filed pursuant to
    the Company’s initial public offering contained materially
    false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material
    facts. Each suit claimed violations of Sections 11,
    12(a)(2)

and/or

15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and the two later filed
    suits added claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the associated

Rule 10b-5.

In February 2008, two of the plaintiffs filed competing motions
    to consolidate the actions and appoint lead plaintiffs and lead
    plaintiffs’ counsel. On March 18, 2008, after one of
    the plaintiffs withdrew his motion, the suits were consolidated
    and plaintiffs in the Mirsky v. ULTA action were appointed
    lead plaintiffs. Lead plaintiffs filed their amended complaint
    on May 19, 2008. The amended complaint alleged no new
    violations of the securities laws not asserted in the prior
    complaints. It added no new defendants and dropped one of the
    then-current officers as a defendant. On July 21, 2008,
    defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On
    September 24, 2008, lead plaintiffs filed their opposition
    to the motion to dismiss, and on October 24, 2008,
    defendants filed their reply memorandum in support of their
    motion to dismiss. On March 19, 2009, defendants’
    motion to dismiss was denied.

On May 29, 2009, the Company and its primary insurance
    carrier engaged in a mediation with counsel representing the
    putative class. Although defendants continue to deny
    plaintiffs’ allegations, in the interest of putting this
    matter behind it, the Company and its insurer reached a
    settlement with plaintiffs. On August 7, 2009, the Court
    entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement,
    approving the form and manner of notice to putative class
    members, and setting a final hearing to determine whether to
    approve the settlement. On November 16, 2009, the Court
    held a final hearing and, no class members having objected to
    the settlement or having requested exclusion from the settlement
    class, the Court entered a final order dismissing all three
    consolidated cases with prejudice. The time for appeal expired
    on December 16, 2009 without any appeal or other challenge
    to the judgment being made. All amounts paid under the
    settlement have been paid out of proceeds of the Company’s
    directors and officers liability insurance coverage.

General litigation

— In July 2009, a putative
    employment class action lawsuit was filed against the Company
    and certain unnamed defendants in State Court in California. The
    suit alleges that Ulta misclassified its store General Managers
    and Salon Managers as exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act
    and California Labor Code. The suit seeks to recover damages and
    penalties as a result of this alleged misclassification. On
    August 27, 2009, the Company filed its answer to the
    lawsuit, and on August 31, 2009 the Company moved the
    action to the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of California. On November 2, 2009, the plaintiffs
    filed an amended complaint adding another named plaintiff.
    Although the Company believes that


Ulta
    Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.

Notes to Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

it has meritorious defenses to the claims made in the putative
    class action and intends to contest the lawsuit vigorously, an
    adverse resolution could have a material adverse effect on its
    financial position and results of operations in the period in
    which the lawsuit is resolved. The Company is not presently able
    to reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to the
    lawsuit.

The Company is also involved in various legal proceedings that
    are incidental to the conduct of its business. In the opinion of
    management, the amount of any liability with respect to these
    proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not
    be material.

At January 30, 2010, the Company had net operating loss
    carryforwards (NOLs) for federal income tax purposes of
    approximately $1,320, which expires between 2010 and 2014. Based
    on Internal Revenue Code Section 382 relating to changes in
    ownership of the Company, utilization of the federal NOLs is
    subject to an annual limitation of $440 for federal NOLs created
    prior to April 1, 1997.

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in
    accordance with the ASC rules for income taxes. The reserve for
    uncertain tax positions was $5,359 at January 30, 2010. The
    balance is the Company’s best estimate of the potential
    liability for uncertain tax positions. The increase in the
    liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax
    positions relates to uncertainty with respect to certain
    domestic tax positions identified during fiscal 2009. A
    reconciliation of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits,
    excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:

    periods

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of
    January 30, 2010 is $1,067 of tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company
    anticipates that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may
    change in the next twelve months. However, it does not expect
    the change to have a significant impact on its financial
    statements. The Company’s liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits was insignificant for fiscal 2008 and 2007. The
    Company’s fiscal 2009 provision for income taxes includes
    $190 of income tax-related interest and penalties related to
    uncertain tax positions. Income tax-related interest and
    penalties were insignificant for fiscal 2008 and 2007.

The Company conducts business only in the United States.
    Accordingly, the tax years that remain open to examination by
    U.S. federal, state, and local tax jurisdictions are
    generally the three prior years, or fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Notes
    payable

The Company’s credit facility is with Bank of America
    National Association as the administrative agent, Wachovia
    Capital Finance Corporation as collateral agent, and JP Morgan
    Chase Bank as documentation agent. This facility provides
    maximum credit of $200,000 through May 31, 2011. The
    facility provides maximum borrowings equal to the lesser of
    $200,000 or a percentage of eligible owned inventory. The
    advance rates on owned inventory are 80% (85% from September 1
    to January 31). The credit facility agreement contains a
    restrictive financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain
    tangible net worth of not less than $80,000. On January 30,
    2010, the Company’s tangible net worth was approximately
    $293,000. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are
    pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the
    facility. Outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate
    or the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00% up to $100,000 and 1.25%
    thereafter.

The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the facility as
    of January 30, 2010. The Company had $106,047 of
    outstanding borrowings under the facility as of January 31,
    2009, with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.52%. The
    Company had approximately $196,933 and $86,764 of availability
    as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009,
    respectively. The Company also had a letter of credit that
    expired in September 2009; the balance was $326 as of
    January 31, 2009.

Financial
    instruments

The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing
    business operations. The primary risk managed by using
    derivative instruments is interest rate risk. Interest rate
    swaps are entered into to manage interest rate risk associated
    with the Company’s variable-rate borrowings. The Company
    accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with
    the ASC rules for derivatives and hedging activities.

On February 1, 2009, the Company adopted the ASC disclosure
    requirements for derivatives and hedging activities. The
    adoption had no impact on amounts recognized in the
    Company’s financial statements. The new rules are intended
    to help investors better understand how derivative instruments
    and hedging activities affect an entity’s financial
    position, financial performance and cash flows through enhanced
    disclosure requirements. The enhanced disclosures primarily
    surround disclosing the objectives and strategies for using
    derivative instruments by their underlying risk as well as a
    tabular format of the fair values of the derivative instruments
    and their gains and losses.

On January 31, 2007, the Company entered into an interest
    rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $25,000 that
    qualified as a cash flow hedge to obtain a fixed interest rate
    on variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest
    rate fluctuations. The swap resulted in fixed rate payments at
    an interest rate of 5.11% for a term of three years, ending on
    January 31, 2010.

The Company does not hold or issue interest rate swap agreements
    for trading purposes. In the event that a counter-party fails to
    meet the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, the
    Company’s exposure is limited to the interest rate
    differential. The Company manages the credit risk of
    counterparties by dealing only with institutions that the
    Company considers financially sound. The Company considers the
    risk of non-performance to be remote.

The Company’s derivative financial instrument is designated
    and qualifies as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, the effective
    portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is
    reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss
    and reclassified into interest expense in the same period or
    periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
    The remaining gain or loss, the ineffective portion, on the
    derivative instrument, if other than inconsequential, is
    recognized in interest expense during the period of change.

Fair
    value measurements

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, and accounts payable approximates their estimated
    fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments.
    The estimated fair value of the Company’s variable rate
    debt approximates its carrying value since the rate of interest
    on the variable rate debt is revised frequently based upon the
    current prime rate or the Eurodollar rate.

On February 3, 2008, the Company adopted the ASC rules for
    fair value measurements and disclosures. The adoption had no
    impact on the Company’s financial statements. The new rules
    established a three-tier hierarchy for fair value measurements,
    which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as
    follows:

a. Level 1 — observable inputs such as
    quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

b. Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices
    in active markets that are observable either directly or
    indirectly through corroboration with observable market data.

c. Level 3 — unobservable inputs in which
    there is little or no market data, which would require the
    Company to develop its own assumptions.

As of January 30, 2010, the Company held certain
    liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis. The fair value of the Company’s
    liabilities associated with its non-qualified deferred
    compensation plan are based primarily on third-party reported
    net asset values, which are primarily based on quoted market
    prices of the underlying assets of the funds and have been
    categorized as Level 2. The following table presents the
    Company’s financial liabilities as of January 30, 2010
    measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Amended
    and Restated Restricted Stock Option Plan

The Company has an Amended and Restated Restricted Stock Option
    Plan (the Amended Plan), principally to compensate and provide
    an incentive to key employees and members of the board of
    directors, under which it


Ulta
    Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.

Notes to Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

may grant options to purchase common stock. Options generally
    are granted with the exercise price equal to the fair value of
    the underlying stock on the date of grant. Options vest over
    four years at the rate of 25% per year from the date of issuance
    and must be exercised within the earlier to occur of
    14 years from the date of grant or the maximum period
    allowed by applicable state law.

    Equity Incentive Plan

In April 2002, the Company adopted the 2002 Equity Incentive
    Plan (the 2002 Plan) to attract and retain the best available
    personnel for positions of substantial authority and to provide
    additional incentive to employees, directors, and consultants to
    promote the success of the Company’s business. Options
    granted on or after April 26, 2002 and before October 2007,
    were granted pursuant to the 2002 Plan. The 2002 Plan
    incorporates several important features that are typically found
    in agreements adopted by companies that report their results to
    the public. First, the maximum term of an option was reduced
    from 14 to ten years in order to comply with various state laws.
    Second, the 2002 Plan provided more flexibility in the vesting
    period of options offered to grantees. Third, the 2002 Plan
    allowed for the offering of incentive stock options to employees
    in addition to nonqualified stock options. Unless provided
    otherwise by the administrator of the 2002 Plan, options vest
    over four years at the rate of 25% per year from the date of
    grant. Options are granted with the exercise price equal to the
    fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

    Incentive Award Plan

In July 2007, the Company adopted the 2007 Incentive Award Plan
    (the 2007 Plan). The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of
    incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted
    stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and
    other types of awards to employees, consultants, and directors.
    Following its adoption, awards are only being made under the
    2007 Plan, and no further awards are made under the Amended Plan
    or the 2002 Plan. The 2007 Plan reserves for issuance upon grant
    or exercise of awards up to 4,108 shares of the
    Company’s common stock plus 598 shares which were not
    issued under the prior plans.

The Company measures share-based compensation cost on the grant
    date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognizes the
    expense on a straight-line method over the requisite service
    period for awards expected to vest. The Company estimated the
    grant date fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes
    valuation model using the following weighted-average assumptions:

The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of
    a peer group of publicly-traded companies. The risk free
    interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve
    in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life
    of the option. The expected life represents the time the options
    granted are expected to be outstanding. We have limited
    historical data related to exercise behavior since our initial
    public offering on October 30, 2007. As a result, the
    Company has elected to use the shortcut approach to determine
    the expected life in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin on share-based payments. Any dividend the Company might
    declare in the future would be subject to the applicable
    provisions of its credit agreement, which currently restricts
    the Company’s ability to pay cash dividends.

The Company granted 977 stock options during fiscal 2009. The
    weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted in
    fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $6.64, $5.46 and $5.64,
    respectively. At January 30, 2010, there was approximately
    $12,738 of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested
    stock options. The unrecognized compensation expense is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
    two years.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $4,783,
    $8,267 and $2,631 in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    The fiscal 2007 valuation includes options exercised after the

Included in the grants for fiscal 2007 are 632 performance-based
    options, whose vesting began upon the initial public offering of
    the Company’s common stock. The fair value of these grants
    was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes
    valuation model as described above. The Company completed an
    initial public offering during fiscal 2007 which resulted in
    compensation expense related to performance based grants of
    $637, $576 and $911 in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    No performance-based options were granted during fiscal 2009 and

Amended
    and restated restricted stock plan

During 2004, the Company issued 442 restricted common shares
    with a fair value of $2.62 per share at the date of grant to
    certain directors pursuant to the Amended Plan. The restricted
    shares cannot be sold or otherwise transferred during the
    vesting period, which ranges from three to four years from the
    issuance date. The Company retains a reacquisition right in the
    event the director ceases to be a member of the board of
    directors of the Company under certain conditions. The awards
    are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
    All outstanding restricted shares became fully vested during
    fiscal 2008.

The compensation expense recorded was $5 and $131 in fiscal
    2008, and 2007, respectively. There was no compensation expense
    recorded in fiscal 2009 and no unrecognized compensation cost
    related to the restricted shares granted under the plan at
    January 30, 2010.

Employee
    benefit plans

The Company provides a 401(k) retirement plan covering all
    employees who qualify as to age, length of service, and hours
    employed. In fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, the plan was funded
    through employee contributions and a Company match of between
    40% and 50% of the first 3% of eligible compensation. For fiscal
    years 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company match was $600, $437 and
    $408, respectively.

On January 1, 2009, the Company established a non-qualified
    deferred compensation plan for highly compensated employees
    whose contributions are limited under qualified defined
    contribution plans. Amounts contributed and deferred under the
    plan are credited or charged with the performance of investment
    options offered under the plan as elected by the participants.
    In the event of bankruptcy, the assets of this plan are
    available to satisfy the claims of general creditors. The
    liability for compensation deferred under the Company’s
    plan included in accrued liabilities was $247 and $16 as of
    January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively.
    Total expense recorded under this plan is included in selling,
    general and administrative expenses and was insignificant during
    fiscal 2009 and 2008. The Company manages the risk of changes in
    the fair value of the liability for deferred compensation by
    electing to match its liability under the plan with

investment vehicles that offset a substantial portion of its
    exposure. The cash value of the investment vehicles included in
    prepaid expense and other current assets was $229 and zero as of
    January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively.

13.

Related-party
    transactions

During fiscal 1997, 1998, and 2001, certain officers of the
    Company were issued shares of Series V, IV, and I Preferred
    Stock, respectively, in exchange for promissory notes. These
    notes bear interest at a rate of 6.85% per annum and were due
    and payable at the earlier of 90 days after termination of
    employment or various dates through November 4, 2007,
    subject to certain exceptions. These notes were fully repaid in
    fiscal 2007.

During fiscal 2006, an officer of the Company exercised stock
    options in exchange for a promissory note for $4,094. The note
    bears interest at a rate of 5.06% per annum and was due at the
    earlier of an initial public offering of the Company’s
    common stock or five years from issuance date. The note was paid
    in full on June 29, 2007.
