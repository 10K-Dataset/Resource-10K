CORPORATE BACKGROUND

General

ADP was founded in 1949 on an innovative idea: to help business owners focus on core business activities by relieving them of certain non-core tasks such as payroll.  Automatic Data Processing, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in June 1961 and completed its initial public offering in September 1961.  A pioneer in business process outsourcing, today we are one of the world’s leading providers of cloud-based human capital management (“HCM”) solutions to employers, offering solutions to businesses of all sizes, whether they have simple or complex needs.  We serve over 740,000 clients in more than 110 countries and territories.  Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market® under the symbol “ADP.”

When we refer to “we,” “us,” “our,” “ADP,” or the “Company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

ADP

’

s Mission and Strategy

ADP’s mission is to power organizations with insightful solutions for clients and their employees, as digital technology, globalization and new business models reshape the way people work.  As the world of work evolves, our technology, expertise and data insights deliver measurable results, peace-of-mind and an enabled, productive workforce.  Our leading technology and commitment to service excellence is at the core of our relationship with each one of our clients, whether it's a small, mid-sized or large organization operating in one or multiple countries around the world.  We are constantly innovating to help our clients leverage HCM solutions in order to streamline and simplify their human resources (“HR”) processes, drive better business results and manage their most important investment – their people.

Our business strategy is based on the following three strategic pillars, which are designed to position ADP as the global market leader in HCM technology and services:

•

Grow a complete suite of cloud-based HCM solutions;

•

Grow and scale our market-leading HR Outsourcing (“HRO”) solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes; and

•

Leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM solutions where ever they do business.

Reportable Segments

ADP’s two reportable business segments are Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services.  For financial data by segment and by geographic area, see Note 15 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


Employer Services

.  Our Employer Services segment serves clients ranging from single-employee small businesses to large enterprises with tens of thousands of employees around the world, offering a comprehensive range of HRO and technology-based HCM solutions, including our strategic, cloud-based platforms.  These solutions address critical client needs and include:

•

Payroll Services

•

Benefits Administration

•

Talent Management

•

HR Management

•

Time and Attendance Management

•

Insurance Services

•

Retirement Services

•

Compliance Services

Professional Employer Organization Services

.  ADP’s PEO business, called ADP TotalSource

®

, serves more than 12,000 clients with comprehensive employment administration outsourcing solutions through a relationship in which employees who work for a client (referred to as “worksite employees”) are co-employed by us and the client.  ADP TotalSource is the largest PEO in the United States based on the number of worksite employees, serving more than 530,000 worksite employees in all 50 states, and operates as a Certified Professional Employer Organization under the United States Internal Revenue Code.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Employer Services’ Products and Services

Human Capital Management.

In order to serve the unique needs of diverse types of businesses and workforce models, ADP provides a range of solutions which businesses of all types and sizes can use to activate talent and lead organizational change as they recruit, pay, manage, and retain their workforce.  We serve more than 630,000 clients via ADP’s cloud-based strategic software as a service (“SaaS”) offerings, which reduce complexity through simplicity, scale and flexibility.  As a leader in the growing HR Outsourcing market, we offer seamless solutions that enable our clients to outsource their HR, time and attendance, payroll, benefits administration and talent management functions to ADP.

Through innovative offerings like the ADP® DataCloud we provide clients with in-depth, workforce and business insights driven by big data.  Through the ADP DataCloud, we also provide clients with a workforce intelligence engine that enables critical HR decisions that power workforce and business productivity, performance and alignment.  For example, ADP’s Pay Equity Explorer combines analytics and benchmarking to help employers gain a better understanding of potential gender or race pay gaps and provide them with real, aggregated and anonymized market data to understand how their compensation for a particular job compares to other employers.

Our innovative payment offerings support employers’ need for flexible payment solutions due to macro trends, including the rise of the contingent workforce or “gig economy,” that are reshaping the employment landscape.  Wisely by ADP™ is our latest advancement in the future of pay.  Following our acquisition of Global Cash Card, we launched the Wisely Pay by ADP payroll card, a network-branded payroll card and digital account that enables employers to disburse payroll to their employees, and enables employees to access their payroll funds immediately, including via a network member bank or an ATM, make purchases or pay bills, load additional funds onto the card, such as tax refunds and military pensions, and transfer funds to a bank account in the United States. We also launched Wisely Direct by ADP, a network-branded general purpose reloadable card and digital account, that offers similar features and functionality as Wisely Pay by ADP but is offered directly to consumers.  Our digital card offerings are true banking alternatives that feature innovative services such as savings, digital wallet and other financial management features.

Through our acquisition of WorkMarket®, a cloud-based workforce management solutions provider, ADP became the first HCM provider with robust freelancer management functionality and reporting insights, enabling clients to effectively manage their extended workforce.


In addition, our mobile applications enable businesses to process their payroll, and give approximately 17 million of our clients’ employees and freelancers convenient access to their payroll and HR information through a variety of mobile device platforms, around the world and in more than 27 languages.  ADP has also opened access for developers and system integrators to certain of our platforms’ Application Programming Interface libraries through the ADP Marketplace.  With ADP Marketplace, clients can integrate employee data from ADP core services across their other business systems, providers or platforms.  This access enables the exchange of client data housed in ADP's databases, and creates a unified HCM ecosystem for clients informed by a single, comprehensive repository of their workforce data.

Integrated HCM Solutions.

Our premier suite of HCM products offers complete solutions that assist employers of all types and sizes in all stages of the employment cycle, from recruitment to retirement:

•

As an integrated and flexible infrastructure supported by a team of experts, ADP GlobalView HCM allows companies of all sizes – from those with small and mid-sized operations to the largest multinational corporations – to standardize their HCM strategies globally (including payroll, HR, talent, time and labor, and benefits management) and adapt to changing local needs, while helping to drive overall organizational agility and engagement.

•

Outside the United States, ADP offers comprehensive HCM solutions on local, country-specific platforms. These suites of services offer various combinations of payroll services, HR management, time and attendance management, talent management and benefits management, depending on the country in which the solution is provided.

Payroll Services.

ADP pays approximately 26 million (approximately 1 out of every 6) workers in the United States, and approximately 14 million workers outside the United States.  ADP provides flexible payroll services to employers of all sizes, including the preparation of employee paychecks, pay statements, supporting journals, summaries, and management reports.  ADP provides employers with a wide range of payroll options, including entering their payroll data online with an Internet-based solution, using a mobile device or outsourcing their entire payroll process to ADP.  ADP also enables its clients to connect their major enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) applications with ADP’s payroll services.  Employers can choose a variety of payroll payment options including ADP’s electronic wage payment and, in the United States, payroll card solutions and digital accounts.  On behalf of our clients in the United States, ADP prepares and files federal, state and local payroll tax returns and quarterly and annual Social Security, Medicare, and federal, state and local income tax withholding reports, and prepares and files similar reports internationally.  In addition, as part of our global payroll services, ADP supplies year-end regulatory and legislative tax statements and other forms to our clients’ employees.  For clients in the United States who choose to process payroll in-house, ADP also offers our Compliance Solutions described below.

Benefits Administration

.  In the United States, ADP provides flexible solutions for employee benefits administration.  These options include health and welfare administration, leave administration services, insurance carrier enrollment services, employee communication services, and dependent verification services.  In addition, ADP benefits administration solutions offer employers an efficient cloud-based eligibility and enrollment system that provides their employees with tools, communications, and other resources they need to understand their benefits options and make informed choices.


Talent Management

.  ADP’s Talent Management solutions simplify and improve the talent acquisition, management, and activation process from recruitment to ongoing employee engagement and development.  ADP’s talent acquisition solutions help employers recruit, screen and on-board talent quickly and cost effectively.  Employers can also meet their hiring needs by outsourcing their internal recruitment function to ADP.  ADP’s talent management solutions provide performance, learning, succession and compensation management tools that help employers align goals to outcomes, while enabling managers to identify and mitigate potential retention risks.  ADP’s talent activation solutions include tools, such as ADP’s StandOut® and Compass™ solutions, which provide team leaders with data and insights to drive employee engagement and leadership development, which in turn help clients drive employee performance while reliably measuring the impact in relation to business outcomes.

Human Resources Management

.  Commonly referred to as Human Resource Information Systems, ADP’s Human Resources Management Solutions provide employers with a single system of record to support the entry, validation, maintenance, and reporting of data required for effective HR management, including employee names, addresses, job types, salary grades, employment history, and educational background.  ADP’s Human Resources Management Solutions can also be combined with ADP’s Talent Management Solutions and other HCM offerings.

Time and Attendance Management

.  ADP offers multiple options for employers of all sizes to collect employee time and attendance information, including electronic timesheets, badge cards, biometric and touch-screen time clocks, telephone/interactive voice response, and mobile smartphones and tablets.  ADP’s time and attendance tracking tools simplify employee scheduling and automate the calculation and reporting of hours worked, helping employers consistently enforce leave and attendance policies, control overtime, and manage compliance with wage and hour regulations.

Insurance Services

.  ADP’s Insurance Services business, in conjunction with our licensed insurance agency, Automatic Data Processing Insurance Agency, Inc., facilitates access in the United States to workers’ compensation and group health insurance for small and mid-sized clients through a variety of insurance carriers.

®

premium payment program calculates and collects workers’ compensation premium payments each pay period simplifying this task for employers.

Retirement Services

.  ADP Retirement Services helps employers in the United States administer various types of retirement plans, such as 401(k) (including “safe harbor” 401(k) and Roth 401(k)), profit sharing (including new comparability), SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA, and executive deferred compensation plans.  ADP Retirement Services offers a full service 401(k) plan program which provides recordkeeping and administrative services, combined with an investment platform offered through ADP Broker-Dealer, Inc. that gives our clients’ employees access to a wide range of non-proprietary investment options and online tools to monitor the performance of their investments.  In addition, ADP Retirement Services offers investment management services to retirement plans through ADP Strategic Plan Services, LLC, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”).

MARKETS AND SALES

Employer Services’ HCM solutions are offered in more than 110 countries and territories.  The most material markets for our HCM solutions are the United States, Canada and Europe. In each market, we have both country-specific solutions and multi-country solutions, for employers of all sizes and complexities.  The major components of our HCM offerings throughout these geographies are payroll, HR outsourcing and time and attendance management.  In addition, we offer wage and tax collection and remittance services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Australia, India, and China. PEO Services offers services exclusively in the United States.

We market our solutions primarily through our direct sales force.  Employer Services also markets its solutions through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with certified public accountants and banks, among others.  None of ADP’s major business groups has a single homogeneous client base or market.  While concentrations of clients exist in specific industries, no one client, industry or industry group is material to ADP’s overall revenues.  ADP enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and does not believe any major service or major business unit of ADP is subject to unique market risk.

COMPETITION

The industries in which ADP operates are highly competitive.  ADP knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of HCM solutions in the world.  Employer Services competes with other business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services, providers of cloud-based HCM solutions and financial institutions.  PEO Services competes with other PEOs providing similar services, as well as business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services and providers of cloud-based HCM solutions.  Other competitive factors include a company’s in-house function, whereby a company installs and operates its own HCM system.

Competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on product and service quality, reputation, ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of offerings, and price. We believe that ADP is competitive in each of these areas and that our leading-edge technology, together with our commitment to service excellence, distinguishes us from our competitors.


INDUSTRY REGULATION

Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations.  In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them.  We have, and continue to enhance, compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations and client solutions, including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs.

As one of the world’s largest providers of HCM solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees.  We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy, data protection and cybersecurity-related laws, including federal, state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data.  The changing nature of these laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union (the “EU”) of the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), will impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients.  The GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, imposes stricter and more comprehensive requirements on us as both a data controller and data processor.  As part of our overall data protection compliance program, including with respect to data protection laws in the EU, in February 2018 we obtained approval from all 28 EU Data Protection Authorities to implement Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”).  Compliance with our BCRs will permit us to process and transfer personal data across borders in accordance with GDPR and other data protection laws in the EU.  In addition, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 applies to our insurance services businesses and ADP TotalSource.

As part of our payroll and payroll tax management services, we move client funds to taxing authorities, our clients’ employees, and other payees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, prepaid access and ADPCheck.  Some elements of our U.S. money transmission activities, including our electronic payment and prepaid access (payroll pay card) offerings, are subject to certain licensing requirements.  In addition, our U.S. prepaid access offering is subject to the anti-money laundering and reporting provisions of The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2000 (the “BSA”).  Elements of our money transmission activities outside of the United States are subject to similar licensing and anti-money laundering and reporting laws and requirements in the countries in which we provide such services.  Our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  ADP TotalSource is subject to various state licensing requirements and maintains certifications with the Internal Revenue Service.  Because ADP TotalSource is a co-employer with respect to its clients’ worksite employees, we may be subject to limited obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax, insurance and employment laws.  In April 2017, we formed a registered investment adviser that provides certain investment management and advisory services to retirement plan administrators under a heightened “fiduciary” standard and is regulated by the SEC and the U.S. Department of Labor.

In addition, many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them.  Although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to ADP, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services.  For example, our payroll services are designed to facilitate compliance with state laws and regulations applicable to the payment of wages.  In addition, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Affordable Care Act in the United States. Similarly, our Tax Credit Services business, which helps clients in the United States take advantage of tax credit opportunities in connection with the hiring of new employees and certain other activities, is based on federal, state, or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits, which are subject to renewal, amendment or rescission.

The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business.  See the discussion contained in the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences.

CLIENTS AND CLIENT CONTRACTS

ADP provides its services to more than 740,000 clients.  In fiscal


, no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of ADP’s annual consolidated revenues.


ADP is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients.  Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients can vary from a short period of time for a small Employer Services client (as little as 24 hours) to a longer period for a large Employer Services client with multiple deliverables (generally six to nine months).  In some cases, the period may exceed two years for a large, multi-country GlobalView client or other large, complicated implementation.  Although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed, we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business.  This metric is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services, and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients.  In addition, some of our products and services are sold under longer term contracts with initial terms ranging from two to seven years.  However, this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of ADP’s expected future revenue, is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not material to management's estimate of ADP’s future revenue.

Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue.  Our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions.  No one price quotation or service agreement is material to ADP.  ADP’s client retention is estimated at approximately 10 years in Employer Services, and approximately 7 years in PEO Services, and has not varied significantly from period to period.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

ADP continually upgrades, enhances, and expands its solutions and services.  In general, new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing solutions and services and, given our recurring revenue model, do not have a material and immediate effect on ADP's revenues. ADP believes that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles.

SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING

During the fiscal years ended June 30,


,


, and


, ADP invested approximately $1 billion, $859 million, and $818 million, respectively, from continuing operations, in systems development and programming, which includes expenses for activities such as client migrations to our new strategic platforms, the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies, including purchases of new software and software licenses.

LICENSES

ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases.  ADP’s business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses.  Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks, and franchises are not material to ADP’s business as a whole.

NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

ADP employed approximately 57,000 persons as of

June 30, 2018

.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate.  The risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business.  The following information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  This discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements.  You should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time, and any of these risks may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences


Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations described in the “Industry Regulation” section in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions and services could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.

In addition, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business.  For example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and, thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities.  Changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income.  Changes in laws that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our PEO business.  Health care reform under the Affordable Care Act, related state laws, and the regulations thereunder, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act, have the potential to further impact the health insurance market for our PEO business and the demand for our health care compliance solutions.  We are unable to determine the additional impact that any of this will have on our PEO business, our ability to attract and retain PEO clients or demand for our health care compliance solutions.

Amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to obtain licenses in some jurisdictions.  The adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions, changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations, or disagreement by a regulatory authority with our interpretation of such statutes or regulations, could require additional registration or licensing, limit certain of our business activities until they are appropriately licensed, and expose us to financial penalties.  These occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or client funds investment strategy, which could adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted.

Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences

Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.  Such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could adversely impact our business.  We operate our business around the world, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.  Such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government

officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  We are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others.  In addition, some of our businesses in the U.S. and a number of countries in which we operate are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including, for example, The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2000 (the “BSA”).  Among other things, the BSA requires certain financial institutions, including banks and money services businesses (such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access), to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. We have registered our payroll card business with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to a FinCEN regulation.

We have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and we are continuously in the process of reviewing, upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures.  However, there can be no assurance that our employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible, or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators.  Any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our


business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. Further, bank regulators are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their BSA obligations, and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses, as a class, to be higher risk customers for money laundering.  As a result, our banking partners may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional requirements on us.  These regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks’ internal risk-based policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us, may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business, may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.

Failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences

The collection, hosting, transfer, disclosure, use, storage and security of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal, state and foreign privacy, data protection and cyber security laws.  These laws, which are not uniform, do one or more of the following: regulate the collection, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, storage, security, use, disclosure and disposal of personal information; require notice to individuals of privacy practices; give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information; and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing.  Under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, clients, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach.  In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries.  The European Union (the “EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, is one of the most comprehensive of these laws.  As part of our overall data protection compliance program, in February 2018 we obtained approval from all 28 EU Data Protection Authorities to implement Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) as both a data processor and data controller, which permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in compliance with EU data protection laws.  Complying with these laws and requirements, including the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR and our BCRs, may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices.  Further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase.  The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability.

Our businesses collect, host, transfer, disclose, use, store and secure personal and business information, and collect, store and transmit client funds, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, cause losses and adversely affect our results of operations

In connection with our business, we collect, host, transfer, disclose, use, store and secure large amounts of personal and business information about our clients, employees of our clients, our vendors and our employees, contractors and temporary staff, including payroll information, health care information, personal and business financial data, social security numbers and their foreign equivalents, bank account numbers, tax information and other sensitive personal and business information.  We also collect and transmit significant amounts of funds from the accounts of our clients to their employees, taxing authorities and others.

We are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information and client funds, and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes.  Nonetheless, globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses.  Although this is a global problem, it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent third parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect, host, use, transmit and store, and the clients funds that we collect and transmit.

We have programs in place to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents.  However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures.  In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other


problems that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems.  Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other methods of deceiving these third parties or our employees, contractors, and temporary staff.  As these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.  In addition, while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information, we do not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients, vendors or partners, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.  Information obtained by malevolent parties resulting from successful attacks against our clients, vendors, partners or other third parties may, in turn, be used to attack our information technology systems.

Any cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, theft of non-public or other sensitive information, or similar act by a malevolent party, or inadvertent acts or inactions by our employees, contractors or temporary staff, could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information or the theft of client funds, and could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of operations, or that of our clients, result in liability, litigation, regulatory investigations and sanctions or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients, or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider.

Although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the data or cyber security incidents that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, a data or cyber security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.  While ADP maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of data and cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of data and cyber risk.

Our systems may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation

Many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions.  We rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems.  If any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, loss of clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.  We have disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events.  Despite our preparations, our plans may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.

A disruption of our data centers could have a materially adverse effect on our business

We host our applications and serve our clients from data centers that we operate and from data centers operated by third-party vendors.  If any of our or our third-party vendors' data centers fail or become disabled, even for a limited period of time, our businesses could be disrupted and we could suffer financial loss, liability to clients, loss of clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.  In addition, our third-party vendors may cease providing data center facilities or services, elect to not renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, breach their agreements with us or fail to satisfy our expectations, which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition.

If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could materially adversely affect our business and our brand

Our ability to compete and success depend, in part, upon our intellectual property. We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, vendors, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights.  We may need to devote significant resources, including cybersecurity resources, to monitoring our intellectual property rights.  In addition, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or ineffective, or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.  Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyber-attack or other wrongful conduct by employees or third parties.  Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights which may be successful.


We may be sued by third parties for infringement of their proprietary rights

There is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry.  Third parties, including our competitors, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our products or services and may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We may be found to be infringing upon such rights, even if we are unaware of their intellectual property rights. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, obtain licenses, modify applications, prevent us from offering our services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers, vendors or partners in connection with any such claim or litigation. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming.

If we fail to upgrade, enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish

Our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences.  In order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, we continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our existing solutions and services.  If we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish.

We may not realize the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives, and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial results and competitive position

We have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives, which are designed to streamline our organization, extend our world-class distribution and strengthen our talent and culture, while supporting our revenue growth, margin improvement and productivity.  If we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives, or if they are inadequate or ineffective, we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits, improvements may be delayed or not realized and our business, operations and competitive position could be adversely affected.  These initiatives, or our failure to successfully manage them, could result in unintended consequences or unforeseen costs, including distraction of our management and employees, attrition, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results

Trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility.  When there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses.  Clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on HCM services or renegotiating their contracts with us, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.

We invest our client funds in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents.  Nevertheless, our client fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks.  These risks may be exacerbated, individually or in unison, during periods of unusual financial market volatility.  In addition, as part of our client funds investment strategy, we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  In order to satisfy these short-term funding requirements, we maintain access to various sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities, our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances.  A reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may require us to sell client fund assets to satisfy our short-term funding requirements, which may result in the recognition of losses and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

We are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll, tax and other money movement services.  While we have contingency plans in place for bank failures, a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll, tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.

We derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the United States and, as a result, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.


Our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others

We may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders.  Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies.  Activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, potential customers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current customers, vendors, investors and other third parties.  In addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.

Change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability

The major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong, investment-grade long-term debt ratings and the highest commercial paper ratings.  Failure to maintain high credit ratings on long-term and short-term debt could increase our cost of borrowing, reduce our ability to obtain intra-day borrowing required by our Employer Services business, and adversely impact our results of operations.

If the distribution of CDK Global® common stock to ADP’s stockholders does not qualify as a tax-free spinoff, we could incur substantial liabilities and may not be fully indemnified for such liabilities

On September 30, 2014, the Company completed the tax-free spinoff of its former Dealer Services business through the distribution of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of CDK Global, Inc. (“CDK Global”) to ADP’s stockholders.  CDK Global was formed to hold ADP’s former Dealer Services business and, as a result of the distribution, became an independent public company trading under the symbol “CDK” on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.  Prior to completing the spinoff of CDK Global, ADP received an opinion from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, its counsel, to the effect that, based on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings set forth in the opinion, the distribution qualified as a transaction that is tax-free under Section 355 and other related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  ADP also received a private letter ruling from the IRS with respect to certain discrete and significant issues arising in connection with the transactions effected in connection with the separation and distribution.  The opinion and the ruling were based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by ADP and CDK Global.  If any of those factual representations or assumptions was untrue or incomplete in any material respect, any undertaking is not complied with, or the facts upon which the opinion and the ruling were based were materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution, the distribution may not qualify for tax-free treatment.  Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, the IRS did not rule that the distribution satisfies every requirement for a tax-free distribution. Opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or the courts. As a result, the conclusions expressed in an opinion of counsel could be challenged by the IRS, and if the IRS prevails in such challenge, the tax consequences to ADP’s stockholders that received CDK Global common stock pursuant to the distribution could be materially less favorable.

If the distribution were determined not to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code, each United States holder of ADP common stock that received CDK Global common stock pursuant to the distribution generally would be treated as receiving a distribution taxable as a dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of CDK Global common stock received by such holder.  In addition, ADP generally would recognize gain with respect to the distribution and certain related transactions, and CDK Global could be required to indemnify ADP for any resulting taxes and related expenses, which could be material.  The distribution and certain related transactions could be taxable to ADP if CDK Global or its stockholders were to engage in certain transactions after the distribution.  In such cases, ADP or its stockholders that received CDK Global common stock pursuant to the spinoff could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and CDK Global could be required to indemnify ADP for any resulting taxes and related expenses, which could be material.  CDK Global may be unable to indemnify us fully for any such taxes and related expenses.

We may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel

Our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients.  Competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and, if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel, results of our operations may suffer.


Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2. Properties

ADP owns 8 of its processing/print centers, and 18 other operational offices, sales offices, and its corporate headquarters in Roseland, New Jersey, which aggregate approximately 3,512,155 square feet.  None of ADP's owned facilities is subject to any material encumbrances.  ADP leases space for some of its processing centers, other operational offices, and sales offices.  All of these leases, which aggregate approximately 6,401,280 square feet worldwide, expire at various times up to the year 2029.  ADP believes its facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained

.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, ADP is subject to various claims and litigation.  While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, ADP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a materially adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

Not applicable.

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data

The following selected financial data is derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe better reflect the underlying operations of our business model, allow investors to assess our performance in a manner similar to the method used by management, and improve our ability to understand and assess our operating performance against prior periods.  Refer to (A) below for additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures and our reconciliations to reported results. Additionally, prior period amounts have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations.

(A) Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:


We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations, against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  The nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.


(a) Our Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations continues to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "All other interest expense" and "All other interest income."

(b) The charges within transformation initiatives in fiscal 2018 includes

$319.6 million

related to the special termination benefit charges and

$17.5 million

of other charges related to our Voluntary Early Retirement Program ("VERP"), severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative of

$20.5 million

, and other transformation initiatives of

$47.2 million

which primarily consist of severance charges totaling

$41.9 million

. Charges for transformation initiatives for periods prior to fiscal 2018 primarily represent severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiative. Refer to Note


of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of charges associated with the VERP.

(c) Represents non-operational costs relating to proxy contest matters.

(d) The taxes on the gains on the sale of the businesses were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.  The tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the year ended

June 30, 2017


due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business and for the year ended

June 30, 2016

due to a previously recorded non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge.

(e) The tax benefit/provision on the transformation initiatives, the gain on the sale of the assets, and non-operational charges related to proxy contest matters was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.

(f) The one-time net provision from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is comprised of a one-time transition tax on the earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries, accrued foreign withholding taxes on future distributions of earning and profit that may no longer be utilizable as foreign tax credits, and the recording of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits which may not be realized offset by the application of the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rates to our U.S. deferred tax balances.  We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining calculations, which could potentially result in the re-measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to future adjustments.

ADP disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.  These risks and uncertainties, along with the risk factors discussed under “Item 1A.  Risk Factors,” and in other written or oral statements made from time to time by ADP, should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

We are one of the largest providers of cloud-based Human Capital Management ("HCM") technology solutions - including payroll, talent management, Human Resources and benefits administration, and time and attendance management - to employers around the world.  As a leader in this industry, we deliver on our global HCM strategy and make investments in highly strategic areas and technology in order to strengthen our underlying business model and prospects for continued growth.

Highlights from the year ended June 30,


("fiscal 2018") include:

•

Worldwide new business bookings increased 8% to $1.8 billion

•

Revenue grew

8%

in fiscal 2018; Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") decreased

5%

to

$3.66

, while adjusted diluted EPS increased

18%

to

$4.35

•

Our shareholder friendly actions continued as we raised our quarterly declared cash dividend by 21% and returned approximately

$2.1 billion

to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases

•

Completed migrations of our mid-market clients to latest version of Workforce Now

•

Executed on a VERP and created a Transformation Office to continue driving broad-based transformation initiatives

At ADP we innovate by anticipating how the world of work is transforming and how trends, such as the rising of the gig economy, impact the needs of our clients and the evolving workforce. We are reshaping the HCM industry through organic innovative development such as our next-gen platforms and our strategic acquisitions such as Global Cash Card, WorkMarket, and more recently, Celergo, Inc., a leading provider of international payroll management services.  With these investments we are enhancing our position as the only global HCM provider that can help businesses address the entire worker spectrum from full-time to freelancer and hire to retire.  As the payroll market continues to rapidly evolve, we continue to be focused on staying ahead of the curve. Through our investments in technology, service, and distribution, we intend to continue to build on our momentum heading into fiscal 2019.

Our new business bookings increased

8%

during fiscal


, as compared to fiscal


, validating the renewed momentum in our sales force following fiscal 2017.  We are confident that the investments in our sales force and products will continue to drive solid results.  We remain optimistic in our ability to deliver innovative and competitive products, as well as our sales force's ability to distribute our products heading into the year ending June 30,


("fiscal


").

During fiscal


, we continued to migrate clients to our strategic platforms while making investments in R&D to provide best-in-class cloud-based HCM technology solutions to our clients.  Employer Services retention was positively impacted by our focus on improving the client experience and was positively impacted by the loss of a large client within our former Consumer Health Spending Account ("CHSA") business during the fiscal year ended June 30,


("fiscal


").  This focus translated into strong retention on our strategic platforms and as a result, we saw Employer Services revenue retention improve


basis points during fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.

Simultaneously, we continue to streamline our service organization.  We remain focused on delivering results and executing on our strategy to transform our business for continued success within the competitive global HCM environment.  During fiscal


, we incurred

$20.5 million

in charges for a previously announced multi-year Service Alignment Initiative intended to align our client service operations to our strategic platforms.  Building upon our Service Alignment Initiative in support of our transformation goals, we are executing upon a voluntary early retirement program and have also identified additional operational improvement initiatives through the formation of our Transformation Office.  These transformation initiatives support ADP’s ongoing strategy which is aimed at streamlining our operations and extending our world class distribution while leveraging our talent and culture.

We have a strong business model and operate in a growing global market. We continue to maintain a high percentage of recurring revenues and healthy margins, and retain our ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows.   Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at

June 30, 2018

, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately

$2.2 billion

. We have benefited from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") signed into law in late December 2017.  With this increased operating cash flow and greater access to our cash worldwide, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation decisions, including assessing reinvestments into the business, potential acquisitions, and/or returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, among other potential uses.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

Prior period amounts have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations (refer to Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

(In millions, except per share amounts)

n/m - not meaningful

Note 1.  Non-GAAP measures

In addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:


We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  The nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.


(a) Our Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations continues to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The


adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "All other interest expense" and "All other interest income."

(b) The charges within transformation initiatives for fiscal 2018 includes

$319.6 million

related to the special termination benefit charges and

$17.5 million

of other charges related to our Voluntary Early Retirement Program ("VERP"), severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative of

$20.5 million

, and other transformation initiatives of

$47.2 million

which primarily consist of severance charges totaling

$41.9 million

for fiscal 2018. Charges for transformation initiatives for periods prior to fiscal 2018 primarily represent severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort.  Unlike severance charges in prior periods, which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiative. Refer to Note


of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of charges associated with the VERP.

(c) Represents non-operational costs relating to proxy contest matters.

(d) The taxes on the gains on the sale of the businesses were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.  The tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the year ended

June 30, 2017

due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business and for the year ended

June 30, 2016

due to a previously recorded non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge.

(e) The tax benefit/provision on the transformation initiatives, the gain on the sale of the assets, and non-operational charges related to proxy contest matters was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.

(f) The one-time net provision from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is comprised of a one-time transition tax on the earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries, accrued foreign withholding taxes on future distributions of earning and profit that may no longer be utilizable as foreign tax credits, and the recording of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits which may not be realized offset by the application of the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rates to our U.S. deferred tax balances.  We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining calculations, which could potentially result in the re-measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to future adjustments.

(g) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our Adjusted net earnings plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes.

(h) "Constant currency basis" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations.  "Constant currency basis" is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.

Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016

Total Revenues

Our revenues, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, which includes one percentage point of pressure from the net impact of acquisitions, the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and foreign currency translation.  Revenue increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings.  Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and PEO Services.

Total revenues in fiscal 2017 include interest on funds held for clients of $397.4 million, as compared to $377.3 million in fiscal 2016.  The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.7% to $23,023.5 million in fiscal 2017.

Total Expenses

Our total expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  The increase is primarily due to an increase in PEO Services pass-through costs, the restructuring and dual operations costs related to our Service Alignment Initiative, and increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue.  These increases were partially offset by the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses during fiscal 2017.

Operating expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  PEO Services pass-through costs were $2,628.4 million for fiscal 2017, which included costs for benefits coverage of $2,173.9 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $454.5 million.  These pass-through costs were $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,906.0 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $430.3 million.  Additionally, operating expenses increased due to higher costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, including dual operation costs associated with our Service Alignment Initiative, partially offset by the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses.


Systems development and programming costs, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.

Selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  The increase was primarily related to investments in our sales organization.  Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to additional restructuring charges which primarily relate to our Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort.

Other Income, net

Other income, net, increased $183.9 million in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  The increase was primarily due to the gain on sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses of $205.4 million in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the gain on sale of the AdvancedMD ("AMD") business of $29.1 million and the gain on the sale of a building of $13.9 million in fiscal 2016.

Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 13% due to the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses as well as the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above, partially offset by the net impact of the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort charges in fiscal 2017 and 2016.  Overall margin increased from 19.2% in fiscal 2016 to 20.4% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, and operating efficiencies, partially offset by the net charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort in fiscal 2017 and 2016, the gain on the sale of the assets and the gain on the sale of AMD in fiscal 2016, and additional interest expense related to our September 2015 $2.0 billion senior note issuance in fiscal 2016.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT excludes certain interest amounts, the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, the impact of the charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and the Workforce Optimization Effort, and the gain on the sale of the assets and the gain on the sale of the AMD business in fiscal 2016.

Adjusted EBIT increased 8% due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above.  Overall Adjusted EBIT margin increased from 19.5% in fiscal 2016 to 19.8% in fiscal 2017 due to operating efficiencies partially offset by 20 basis points of pressure from dual operation costs related to our Service Alignment Initiative.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 31.5% and 33.2%, respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 210 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of  Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017.  These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses and a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017.

Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate, adjusted for the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, the impact of the charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort, the gain on the sale of the assets and the gain on the sale


of the AMD business in fiscal 2016, for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 30.9% and 33.3%, respectively.  The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 220 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017. This decrease was offset by a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

Net earnings from continuing operations, as reported, increased 16% in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the reduction in our effective tax rate described above, when compared to fiscal 2016.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% to $3.85 in fiscal 2017, as compared to $3.25 in fiscal 2016.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations (inclusive of a $0.07 impact from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017) and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 13.5 million shares in fiscal 2017 and 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.

Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 11% in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in adjusted EBIT and reduction in our effective tax rate described above when compared to fiscal 2016.

For fiscal 2017, our Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations reflects the increase in Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (inclusive of a $0.07 impact from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017) and the impact of fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of 13.5 million shares during fiscal 2017 and the repurchase of 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2016, partially offset by shares issued under our employee benefit plans.

Other

The primary components of “Other” are non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, the elimination of intercompany transactions, interest expense, the results of operations of ADP Indemnity, certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments. Changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate level allocations, has been adjusted in both the current period and the prior period in the table above, and did not materially affect reportable segment results.  Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") will begin reviewing segment results reported at actual interest rates and the results of the PEO segment inclusive of the results of ADP Indemnity.  Additionally, the CODM will begin reviewing results with changes to certain corporate allocations.  These changes represent a change in the measure of segment performance.  The Company will reflect these new segment measures beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and prior period segment results will be restated for comparability.

ADP Indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence.  PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG.  We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO Services business.  Premiums are charged by ADP Indemnity to PEO Services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the PEO Services' worksite employees.  The premiums charged from ADP Indemnity to PEO Services are eliminated in Other segment.  Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity and included in Other segment.  ADP Indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $40 million in fiscal 2018 and $20 million in fiscal 2017, which was primarily the result of favorable changes in estimated incurred losses.  For the fiscal years 2013 to


, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited, to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity during these policy years.  Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit.  We believe the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote.  During fiscal


, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of

$235.0 million

to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb Limited to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal


policy year to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees.  ADP Indemnity paid a premium of

$218.0 million

in July


to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for fiscal


policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal


reinsurance policy.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

For corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, long-term marketable securities, and cash flow from operations together with our

$9.8 billion

of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures. Additionally, we will benefit from the Act.  We anticipate a future adjusted effective tax rate, excluding one-time items, of  25% to 26% beyond fiscal 2018.  With this increased operating cash flow and greater access to our cash worldwide, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation decisions, including assessing reinvestments into the business, potential acquisitions, and/or returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, among other potential uses.

For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short-term reverse repurchase agreements together with our

$9.8 billion

of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  Please see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a further discussion of the risks of our client funds investment strategy.  See Note


of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.

As of

June 30, 2018

, cash and cash equivalents were $

2.2 billion

, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.

Operating, Investing and Financing Cash Flows

Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for the years ended


,


, and


, are summarized as follows:


*See Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of adjustments.

Fiscal


Compared to Fiscal


Net cash flows

provided by

operating activities in fiscal


increase

d primarily due to growth in our underlying business (net income adjusted for non-cash adjustments such as the VERP in fiscal 2018 and the gain on the sale of COBRA and CHSA in fiscal 2017).

Net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds offset by purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of

$632.6 million

, payments made related to acquisitions in fiscal 2018 and proceeds from the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses of

$234.0 million

in fiscal


.

Net cash flows from financing activities changed due to

a net increase

in the cash flow from client funds obligations of

$6,461.0 million

, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees and less cash paid for share repurchases.  We purchased approximately

8.5 million

shares of our common stock at an average price per share of

$116.07

during fiscal


as compared to purchases of

13.5 million

shares at an average price per share of

$94.42

during fiscal


.  From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.  The increased cash flow from client fund obligations and reduced share repurchases were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders via dividends, which increased by $68.5 million from fiscal 2017.

Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016

Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to growth in our business and favorable changes in our working capital, which was due to the timing of payments from our clients and to our vendors in the ordinary course of business.

Net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $1,493.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client fund marketable securities of $1,621.8 million.

Net cash flows from financing activities changed due to the net decrease in client funds obligations of $14,923.9 million, as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, and proceeds from our $2.0 billion September 2015 debt issuance.

We purchased approximately 13.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $94.42 during fiscal 2017 as compared to purchases of 13.8 million shares at an average price per share of $82.88 during fiscal 2016.  From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.

In fiscal 2016, we issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025.  We may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure.  However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our long-term financing, including this fiscal 2016 debt issuance.

Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to

$9.8 billion

in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and Prime-1 by Moody’s.  These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities.  Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days.  In fiscal


and


, our average daily borrowings were

$2.8 billion

and

$3.1 billion

, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of

1.4%

and

0.6%

, respectively.   The weighted average maturity of our commercial paper during fiscal


and


was approximately

two days

.  At

June 30, 2018

and


, we had

no

outstanding obligations under our short-term commercial paper program.

Our U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days.  We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  At

June 30, 2018

and

June 30, 2017

, there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements.  For fiscal


and


, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of

$374.4 million

and

$274.8 million

, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of

1.3%

and

0.6%

, respectively.  See Note


of our Consolidated Financial Statements for client fund investments used as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements.

We vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility.  We have a

$3.8 billion

, 364-day credit agreement that matures in

June 2019

with a one year term-out option.  In addition, we have a five-year

$3.75 billion

credit facility and a five-year

$2.25 billion

credit facility maturing in

June 2023

and

June 2022

, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $

500 million

, subject to the availability of additional commitments.  The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  We had no borrowings through

June 30, 2018

under the credit facilities. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the

$9.8 billion

available to us under the revolving credit agreements.  See Note


of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.

Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities.  We own AAA rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, auto loan, equipment lease, and rate reduction receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral.  All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected.  In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks.  Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.  See Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.

Capital expenditures for fiscal


were $192.0 million, as compared to

$249.1

million for fiscal


. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal


to be about $250 million.


Contractual Obligations

The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at

June 30, 2018

:

(1)

These amounts represent the principal and interest payments of our debt.

(2)

Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases.  We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment.  The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time.  Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices.  Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.

(3)

Purchase obligations are comprised of a

$218.0 million

reinsurance premium with Chubb for the fiscal


policy year, as well as obligations related to software subscription licenses and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.

(4)

Based on current estimates, we expect to make cash payments up to

$23.4 million

in the next twelve months for obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits across various jurisdictions and tax periods. For

$21.8 million

of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments are expected to be paid.

(5)

Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements.  These amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be

$8.3 million

in fiscal


.

(6)

Acquisition-related obligations relate to contingent consideration for a business acquisition for which the amount of contingent consideration was determinable at the date of acquisition and therefore included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability.

In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services.  As of

June 30, 2018

, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal


, total

$27,493.5 million

and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We had

$27,137.8 million

of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

June 30, 2018

.

Separately, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of

$218.0 million

in July


to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal


policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal


reinsurance policy.  At

June 30, 2018

, ADP Indemnity had total assets of

$523.7 million

to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of

$433.8 million

for the policy years since July 1, 2003.  ADP Indemnity paid claims of $

4.6 million

and

$10.7 million

, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal


and


, respectively.  Refer to the "Analysis of Reportable Segments - Other" above for additional information regarding ADP Indemnity.

In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.


Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).

Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes.  All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.

Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.

We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation.  As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.

There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets.  Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations.  However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations.  We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our

$9.8 billion

commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and Prime-1 ("P-1") by Moody’s, the highest possible credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our

$9.8 billion

committed credit facilities.  The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.  In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.

We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments.  The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A.  The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years.  Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1.  Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf.


Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows:

We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested.  Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.  This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes.  The annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased slightly to

1.9%

for fiscal


, as compared to fiscal


.  A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $8 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending

June 30, 2019

.  A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $4 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending

June 30, 2019

.

We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, DBRS for Canadian denominated securities, and Fitch for asset-backed and commercial mortgage backed securities.  Approximately

80%

of our available-for-sale securities held a AAA or AA rating at

June 30, 2018

.  In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government and United Kingdom government securities.

We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.  We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.  We had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at

June 30, 2018

or

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 1, New Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.

Revenue Recognition.

Our

revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (

e.g.,

Employer Services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the Company's solutions.  We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (

e.g.,

number of payees or number of payrolls processed).  Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

PEO provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers’ compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions.  Amounts collected from PEO worksite employers include payroll, fees for benefits, and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes, fees for workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes.

The payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers are presented in revenue net, as the Company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the PEO arrangement.  With respect to the payroll and payroll taxes, the worksite employer is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, and determines the service specifications.

The fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses, as the Company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement.  With respect to the fees for benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes, the Company is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk.

We recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.

Client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on our solutions and are deferred until the client has gone live and services have begun.  These fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or expected client life, including estimated renewals of client contracts.

We assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.

Goodwill

.  We account for goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2018 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.  We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business.  Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates.  Several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade,


enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences.  As such, the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margins.  Based upon the quantitative assessment, the Company has concluded that goodwill is not impaired.

Income Taxes.

The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns.  Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (

e.g.

, realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).  In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other tax authorities.  A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.

There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Specifically, the likelihood of an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not”  assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements.  If a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized.  Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.  A change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.  As of

June 30, 2018

and


, the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were

$45.2 million

and

$74.6 million

, respectively.

If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions.  Based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings by up to

$2 million

and expected cash payments could be up to

$25 million

in the next twelve months.  The liability related to cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months has been reclassified from other liabilities to current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability, and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

Roseland, New Jersey

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 3, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTE


. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. Basis of Preparation.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.its subsidiaries and variable interest entity (“ADP” or the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In fiscal 2018, the Company created a grantor trust, which now holds the majority of the funds provided by its clients pending remittance to employees of those clients, tax authorities, and other payees.  The Company is the sole beneficial owner of the trust.  The trust meets the criteria in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810 “Consolidation” to be characterized as a variable interest entity (“VIE”).  The Company has determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the trust because it has both (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust (including the power to make all investment decisions for the trust) and (2) the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trust (in the form of investment returns) and therefore, consolidates the trust.  Further information on these funds and the Company’s obligations to remit to its clients’ employees, tax authorities, and other payees is provided in Note 6, “Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.”

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto.  Actual results may differ from those estimates.  The Consolidated Financial Statements and all relevant footnotes have been adjusted for the Procure-to-Pay business that qualified as a discontinued operation.

Certain amounts from the prior year's financial statements have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year's presentation.

B. Description of Business.

The Company is a provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management ("HCM") solutions. The Company classifies its operations into the following two reportable segments: Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services.  The primary components of the “Other” segment are non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, the elimination of intercompany transactions, interest expense, the results of operations of ADP Indemnity (a wholly-owned captive insurance company that provides workers’ compensation and employee’s liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services’ worksite employees), and certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments.  Changes to the allocation methodology for certain allocations have been adjusted in both the current period and the prior period and did not materially affect reportable segment results.

C. Revenue Recognition.

Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (

e.g.,

Employer Services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds, other Employer Services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the Company's solutions.  The Company enters into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (

e.g.,

number of payees or number of payrolls processed).  Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

PEO provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers’ compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions.  Amounts collected from PEO worksite employers include payroll, fees for benefits, and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes, fees for workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes.

The payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers are presented in revenue net, as the Company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the PEO arrangement.  With respect to the payroll and payroll taxes, the worksite employer is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, and determines the service specifications.

The fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses, as the Company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement.  With respect to the fees for benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes, the Company is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk.


Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.

Client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on the Company's platform and are deferred until the client has gone live on the Company's solutions and services have begun.  These fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or the expected client life, including estimated renewals of client contracts.  Additionally, certain implementation costs are deferred until the client has gone live on the Company's solution and services have begun and are then amortized over the longer of the contractual term or the expected client life, including estimated renewals of client contracts.

The Company assesses the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.

D. Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Highly liquid investment securities with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents.  The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value.

E. Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.

All of the Company's marketable securities are considered to be “available-for-sale” and, accordingly, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized.  Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific-identification basis and are included in other expense/(income), net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.

If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the Company assesses whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery.  If either of those two conditions is met, the Company would recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value.  If the Company does not intend to sell a security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security as an adjustment to yield using the effective-interest method.  Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.

F. Fair Value Measurements.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is based upon the Company’s principal, or most advantageous, market for a specific asset or liability.

U.S. GAAP provides for a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows:

Level 1  Fair value is determined based upon quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that are traded in active markets.

Level 2  Fair value is determined based upon inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including:

· quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

· quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;

· inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or

· inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

Level 3  Fair value is determined based upon inputs that are unobservable and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based upon the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows).

The Company's corporate investments and funds held for clients (see Note 6) and its long term debt are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as described below.  Over

99%

of the Company's available-for-sale securities included in Level 2 are valued based on prices obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of the Company's Level 2 investments, the independent pricing service uses various pricing models for each asset class that are consistent with what other


market participants would use, including the market approach.  Inputs and assumptions to the pricing model of the independent pricing service are derived from market observable sources including:  benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market-related data. Since many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the independent pricing service applies available information, as applicable, through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare valuations.  For the purposes of valuing the Company’s asset-backed securities, as well as the mortgage-backed securities that are included within Other securities in Note 6, the independent pricing service includes additional inputs to the model such as monthly payment information, new issue data, and collateral performance.  For the purposes of valuing the Company’s Municipal bonds, the independent pricing service includes Municipal Market Data benchmark yield curves as additional inputs to the model.  While the Company is not provided access to the proprietary models of the third party pricing service, each quarterly reporting period, the Company reviews the inputs utilized by the independent pricing service and compares the valuations received from the independent pricing service to valuations from at least one other observable source for reasonableness. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service and the Company believes the prices received from the independent pricing service are representative of the prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (exit price). The Company has no available-for-sale securities included in Level 1 and Level 3.

In fiscal


, the Company issued fixed-rate notes with


-year and


-year maturities for an aggregate principal amount of

$2.0 billion

(collectively the "Notes").  The  Notes are valued utilizing a variety of inputs obtained from an independent pricing service, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.  The Company reviews the values generated by the independent pricing service for reasonableness by comparing the valuations received from the independent pricing service to valuations from at least one other observable source.  The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service.

The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.  In certain instances, the inputs used to measure fair value may meet the definition of more than one level of the fair value hierarchy.  The significant input with the lowest level priority is used to determine the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy.

G. Property, Plant and Equipment.

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Depreciation is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.  The estimated useful lives of assets are primarily as follows:

The Company has obligations under various facilities and equipment leases.  The Company assesses whether these arrangements meet the criteria for capital leases by determining whether the agreement transfers ownership of the asset, whether the lease includes a bargain purchase option, whether the lease term is for greater than

75%

of the asset's useful life, or whether the minimum lease payments exceed

90%

of the leased equipment's fair market value.  All of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases.   Total expense under these operating lease agreements was approximately

$234.9 million

,

$234.5 million

, and

$201.7 million

in fiscal


,


, and


, respectively.

H. Goodwill.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2018 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.  We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business.  Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates.  Several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences.  As such, the determination of fair value


requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margins.  Based upon the quantitative assessment, the Company has concluded that goodwill is not impaired.

I. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.

J. Foreign Currency.

The net assets of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect for each period, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in the periods.  Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Currency transaction gains or losses, which are included in the results of operations, are not significant for all periods presented.

K. Foreign Currency Risk Management Programs and Derivative Financial Instruments.

The Company transacts business in various foreign jurisdictions and is therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.  The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

L. Earnings per Share (“EPS”).

The Company computes EPS in accordance with ASC 260.

The calculations of basic and diluted EPS are as follows:

Options to purchase

0.9 million

,

1.0 million

, and

1.8 million

shares of common stock for fiscal


,


, and


, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

M. Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant, and in the case of international units settled in cash, adjusts this fair value based on changes in the Company's stock price during the vesting period.  The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued using a binomial option-pricing model.  The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior.  Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Company's stock price, and other factors.  Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes.  The risk-


free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data.  The expected life of a stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.  Restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are valued based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant and, in the case of performance based restricted stock units and restricted stock, are adjusted for changes to probabilities of achieving performance targets.  International restricted stock units are settled in cash and are marked-to-market based on changes in the Company's stock price.  See Note


for additional information on the Company's stock-based compensation programs.

N. Internal Use Software.

Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a

three

to

five

-year period on a straight-line basis.  The Company begins to capitalize costs incurred for computer software developed for internal use when the preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended.  Capitalization ceases when a computer software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.

The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software.  In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects.  The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects.  Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.  The Company also expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities.

O. Acquisitions.

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company are included in the Statements of Consolidated Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the excess purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when the Company receives final information, including appraisals and other analysis. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months.

P. Income Taxes.

The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns.  The Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities.

There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Specifically, the likelihood of  an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not,” assuming that these positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements.  If a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized.  Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.  As of

June 30, 2018

and


, the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were

$45.2 million

and

$74.6 million

, respectively.

If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions.  Based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings by up to

$2 million

and expected cash payments could be up to

$25 million

in the next twelve months.  The liability related to cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months has been reclassified from other liabilities to current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability, and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.

Q. Workers' Compensation Costs.

The Company employs a third-party actuary to assist in determining the estimated claim liability related to workers' compensation and employer's liability coverage for PEO Services worksite employees.  In estimating ultimate loss rates, we utilize historical loss experience, exposure data, and actuarial judgment, together with a range


of inputs which are primarily based upon the worksite employee's job responsibilities, their location, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends.  For each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers' compensation claims cost estimates.  PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance policy that has a

$1 million

per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the

$1 million

retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG.  For the fiscal years 2013 to 2017, as well as in July 2017 for the year ended June 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018") policy year, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited ("Chubb"), to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity during these policy years.  Each of these reinsurance arrangements limit our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit.  The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote.  ADP Indemnity paid a premium of

$218.0 million

in July 2018 to enter into a reinsurance arrangement to cover substantially all losses for the fiscal 2019 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2018 policy.

R. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2018-02, "Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income." ASU 2018-02 allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) from accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income to retained earnings. The June 30, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the reclassification out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into retained earnings of

$42.3 million

.  The Company's policy for releasing disproportionate income tax effects from AOCI utilizes the aggregate approach. Refer to Note 14 for additional detail regarding the components of the reclassification. The adoption of ASU 2018-02 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows.

Effective July 1, 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash."  ASU 2016-18 requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.  The Company retrospectively adopted the new standard, and as a result included restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts presented on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.  Accordingly, the statement of cash flows has been revised to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents associated with funds held to satisfy client obligations, as a component of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. As a result of this adoption, the Company adjusted the


Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows from previously reported amounts as follows:

Effective July 1, 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairments.” ASU 2017-04 establishes a one-step process for testing goodwill for a decrease in value, requiring a goodwill impairment loss to be measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. The guidance eliminates the second step of the current two-step process that requires the impairment to be measured as the difference between the implied value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the goodwill’s carrying amount.  The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

In July 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2017-01, "Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business." ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business in order to allow for the evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.  The adoption of ASU 2017-01 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

The following table summarizes recent ASU's issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") that could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.




Estimated impact of adoption of ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2017-07 on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings:

*Includes the impact of the remeasurement, as required by the Act, of deferred tax liabilities associated with the capitalized selling and implementation expenses created as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS

In

October 2017

, the Company acquired

100%

of the outstanding shares of Global Cash Card, Inc. ("GCC"), a leader in digital payments, including paycards and other electronic accounts, for approximately

$490 million

in cash, net of cash acquired.  The acquisition of GCC makes ADP the only human capital management provider with a proprietary digital payments processing platform.  The results of GCC are reported within the Company’s Employer Services segment.  Pro forma information has not been presented because the effect of the acquisition is not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.

The preliminary purchase price allocation for GCC is as follows:


The Company determined the purchase price allocations for this acquisition based on estimates of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, utilizing recognized valuation techniques, including the income and market approaches.  The goodwill recorded as a result of the GCC transaction represents future economic benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition and expected cost synergies.  None of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition is tax deductible. Intangible assets for GCC, which totaled $

132.5 million

, included technology and software, and customer contracts and lists which are being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately

8 years

.

In

January 2018

, the Company acquired

100%

of the outstanding shares of WorkMarket, Inc. ("WorkMarket"), a leading provider of cloud-based freelance management solutions, for approximately

$125 million

in cash.  The results of WorkMarket are reported within the Company’s Employer Services segment.

The Company acquired

two

businesses during fiscal


for total upfront cash consideration of approximately

$90 million

and with remaining value of contingent consideration of up to

$12 million

, which is payable over the next

two years

, subject to the achievement of specified financial metrics and/or other conditions.  The Company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date using various estimates that are not observable in the market and represent a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.

The acquisitions, individually or in aggregate, were not material to the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows and, therefore, the pro forma impact of these acquisitions is not presented. The results of the acquisitions are reported within the Company’s Employer Services segment.

The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to change within the purchase price allocation period, which is generally one year from the acquisition date.  The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the measurement of certain assets and liabilities, certain tax matters, and residual goodwill.  Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information becomes available but will not exceed twelve months from the date of acquisition.

NOTE


. DIVESTITURES

On

November 28, 2016

, the Company completed the sale of its Consumer Health Spending Account ("CHSA") and Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act ("COBRA") businesses for a pre-tax gain of

$205.4 million

, and recorded such gain within Other expense/(income), net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.  The historical results of operations of these businesses are included in the Employer Services segment.

On

September 1, 2015

, the Company completed the sale of its AdvancedMD ("AMD") business for a pre-tax gain of

$29.1 million

, less costs to sell, and recorded such gain within Other expense/(income), net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.  The historical results of operations of this business are included in the Other segment.

The Company determined that the CHSA, COBRA and AMD divestitures did not meet the criteria for reporting discontinued operations under ASU 2014-08 as the disposition of these businesses does not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company's operations or financial results.

NOTE 4. SERVICE ALIGNMENT INITIATIVE

On July 28, 2016, the Company announced a Service Alignment Initiative that simplified the Company's service organization by aligning the Company's service operations to its strategic platforms and locations.  In fiscal 2016, the Company entered into leases in Norfolk, Virginia and Maitland, Florida, and in fiscal 2017, the Company entered into a lease in Tempe, Arizona as part of this effort.  The Company began incurring charges during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  The charges primarily relate to employee separation benefits recognized under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 712, and also include charges for the relocation of certain current Company employees, lease termination costs, and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets.  The Company expects to recognize pre-tax restructuring charges of about

$10 million

in fiscal 2019, consisting primarily of cash expenditures for employee separation benefits.


The table below summarizes the composition of the Company's Service Alignment Initiative charges for fiscal year 2018 and  2017, respectively:

(a) Charges are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.

(b) Other initiative costs include costs to relocate certain current Company employees to new locations, lease termination charges (both included within selling, general and administrative expenses on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings), and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets (included within depreciation and amortization on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings).

(c) All charges are included within the Other segment.

-day credit agreement that matures in

June 2019

with a

one year

term-out option. The Company also has a

$2.25 billion

five

-year credit facility that matures in

June 2022

that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by

$500 million

, subject to the availability of additional commitments.  In addition, the Company has a

$3.75 billion

credit facility maturing in

June 2023

that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by

$500 million

, subject to the availability of additional commitments.  The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the effective federal funds rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing.  The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements.  The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  The Company had

no

borrowings through

June 30, 2018

and


under the credit agreements.

The Company's U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  The company increased its U.S. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to

$9.8 billion

from

$9.5 billion

in aggregate maturity value in June 2018. The Company’s commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and Prime-1 by Moody’s.  These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities.  Maturities of commercial paper can range from

, respectively.  The weighted average maturity of the Company’s commercial paper in fiscal


and


was approximately

two days

.

The Company’s U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally


by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  These agreements generally have terms ranging from

overnight to up to five business days

.  At

June 30, 2018

and


, there were

no

outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements.  In fiscal


and


, the Company had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of

$374.4 million

and

$274.8 million

, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of

1.3%

and

0.6%

, respectively.

NOTE


. LONG TERM DEBT

The Company has fixed-rate notes with


-year and


-year maturities for an aggregate principal amount of

$2.0 billion

(collectively the “Notes”).  The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, semi-annually.

The principal amounts and associated effective interest rates of the Notes and other debt as of

June 30, 2018

and


are as follows:

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes and amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs.

As of

June 30, 2018

, the fair value of the Notes, based on level 2 inputs, was

$1,976.0 million

.  For a description of the fair value hierarchy and the Company's fair value methodologies, including the use of an independent third-party pricing service, see Note


"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."

NOTE


. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

A.  Stock-based Compensation Plans.

Stock-based compensation consists of the following:

•

Stock Options.

Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the dates of grant.  Stock options are issued under a graded vesting schedule and have a term of

10 years

.  Options granted after July 1, 2008 generally vest ratably over

four years

.  Compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the stock option on the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the stock option award.  Stock options are forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.

•

Restricted Stock.

•

Time-Based Restricted Stock and Time-Based Restricted Stock Units.

Time-based restricted stock and time-based restricted stock units granted are generally subject to a vesting period of

two years

.  Awards are forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.

Time-based restricted stock cannot be transferred during the vesting period.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of time-based restricted stock is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Dividends are paid on shares awarded under the time-based restricted stock program.

Time-based restricted stock units are settled in cash and cannot be transferred during the vesting period.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of time-based restricted stock units is recorded over the vesting period and is initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and is subsequently


remeasured at each reporting date during the vesting period based on the change in the ADP stock price.  No dividend equivalents are paid on units awarded under the time-based restricted stock unit program.

•

Performance-Based Restricted Stock and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units.

Performance-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units generally vest over a

one

to

three

year performance period and a subsequent service period of up to

26 months

.  Under these programs, the Company communicates "target awards" at the beginning of the performance period with possible payouts at the end of the performance period ranging from

0%

to

150%

of the "target awards."  Awards are generally forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.

Performance-based restricted stock cannot be transferred during the vesting period.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock is recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of shares awarded during the performance period based on probable and actual performance against targets.  After the performance period, if the performance targets are achieved, employees are eligible to receive dividends during the remaining vesting period on shares awarded under the performance-based restricted stock program.

Performance-based restricted stock units cannot be transferred and are settled in either cash or stock, depending on the employee's home country.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in cash is recognized over the vesting period initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of units awarded during the performance period based on probable and actual performance against targets.  In addition, compensation expense is remeasured at each reporting period during the vesting period based on the change in the ADP stock price.  Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in stock is recorded over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of units awarded based on the probable and actual performance against targets.  Dividend equivalents are paid on awards under the performance-based restricted stock unit program.

•

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

The Company offers an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to

95%

of the market value for the Company's common stock on the last day of the offering period.  This plan has been deemed non-compensatory and, therefore, no compensation expense has been recorded.

The Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Company's employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock awards.  From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  The Company repurchased

8.5 million

shares in fiscal


as compared to

13.5 million

shares repurchased in fiscal


.  The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.  Cash payments related to the settlement of vested time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units were approximately

$27.1 million

,

$24.5 million

, and

$25.2 million

during fiscal years


,


, and


, respectively.

The following table represents stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits in each of fiscal


,


, and


, respectively:

As of

June 30, 2018

, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards amounted to

$13.3 million

,

$54.4 million

, and

$65.6 million

, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of

2.2 years

,

1.5 years

, and

1.1 years

, respectively.


In fiscal


, the following activity occurred under the Company’s existing plans.

Stock Options:

Time-Based Restricted Stock and Time-Based Restricted Stock Units:

Performance-Based Restricted Stock and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units:

The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding stock options and exercisable stock options as of

June 30, 2018

The fair value for stock options granted was estimated at the date of grant using the following assumptions:

The weighted average fair values of shares granted were as follows:


B.  Pension Plans

The Company has a defined benefit cash balance pension plan under which employees are credited with a percentage of base pay plus interest.  Effective January 1, 2015, associates hired on or after this date are not eligible to participate in this pension plan.  In addition, associates rehired on or after January 1, 2015 will no longer be eligible to earn additional contributions but will continue to earn interest on any balance that remains in the pension plan.  The plan interest credit rate varies from year-to-year based on the

ten-year U.S. Treasury rate

.  Employees are fully vested upon completion of

three years

of service. The Company's policy is to make contributions within the range determined by generally accepted actuarial principles.

On

March 1, 2018

, the Company offered a voluntary early retirement program ("VERP") to certain eligible U.S.-based associates aged


or above with at least

10 years

of service. The early retirement offer was extended to about

3,500

eligible associates, or approximately


percent of the Company’s workforce. The window for elections closed on

May 1, 2018

, with approximately

2,200

ADP associates opting to participate.  ADP will fund a significant majority of the program costs from the existing surplus in ADP’s U.S. defined benefit plan, which resulted in a special termination charge from the U.S. pension plan of

$319.6 million

, which has been included within Other expense/(income), net, on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.

The Company also extended to all employees participating in the VERP the opportunity to continue health care coverage at active employee contribution rates for up to


months following retirement. The Company recorded

$13.4 million

of expenses within selling, general, and administrative expenses related to the continuing health coverage for VERP participants who have exited the Company as of June 30, 2018. The Company anticipates recording a charge in fiscal 2019 for the remaining participants who will exit and continue health coverage during fiscal 2019, which may total up to

$35 million

, but is based on the number of associates electing this benefit and the health care option selected by each associate.

Additionally, as a result of the VERP in fiscal 2018, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expenses of

$3.8 million

related to the modification of awards previously granted to the VERP participants.

The Company anticipates recording a non-cash settlement charge in fiscal 2019, within Other expense/(income), net, on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings, which is contingent on the number of participants electing the lump sum payment option and other actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and long-term rate of return on assets.

The Company also has various retirement plans for its non-U.S. employees and maintains a Supplemental Officers Retirement Plan (“SORP”).  The SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company pays supplemental pension benefits to certain corporate officers upon retirement based upon the officers' years of service and compensation. The SORP, which is currently closed to new entrants, will be frozen effective

July 1, 2019

.  Benefits under the plan will continue to accrue through

June 30, 2019

, and as of

July 1, 2019

and onward, participants will retain their accrued benefits with no future accruals due to pay and/or service.

A

June 30

measurement date was used in determining the Company's benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets.

The Company is required to (a) recognize in its Consolidated Balance Sheets an asset for a plan's net overfunded status or a liability for a plan's net underfunded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer's fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the year in which the changes occur in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The Company's pension plans' funded status as of

June 30, 2018

and


is as follows:


The amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

June 30, 2018

and


consisted of:

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was

$2,121.1 million

and

$1,852.5 million

at

June 30, 2018

and


, respectively.

The Company's pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of

June 30, 2018

and


had the following projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets:


The components of net pension expense were as follows:

The net actuarial loss and prior service credit for the defined benefit pension plans that are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost are

$238.1 million

and

$19.0 million

, respectively, at

June 30, 2018

.  There is no remaining transition obligation for the defined benefit pension plans included in accumulated other comprehensive income.  The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service credit for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension cost in fiscal


are

$1.8 million

and

$2.2 million

, respectively.

Assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were:

Assumptions used to determine the net pension expense generally were:

The discount rate is based upon published rates for high-quality fixed-income investments that produce cash flows that approximate the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is determined based on historical and expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the target asset mix and the long-term investment strategy.

Plan Assets

The Company's pension plans' asset allocations at

June 30, 2018

and


by asset category were as follows:


The Company's pension plans' asset investment strategy is designed to ensure prudent management of assets, consistent with long-term return objectives and the prompt fulfillment of all pension plan obligations.  The investment strategy and asset mix were developed in coordination with an asset liability study conducted by external consultants to maximize the funded ratio with the least amount of volatility.

The pension plans' assets are currently invested in various asset classes with differing expected rates of return, correlations, and volatilities, including large capitalization and small capitalization U.S. equities, international equities, U.S. fixed income securities, and cash.

The target asset allocation ranges for the U.S. plan are generally as follows:

The U.S. pension plan's fixed income asset allocation for fiscal 2018 was outside of the target range due to the previously mentioned VERP in order to meet anticipated lump sum payments to participants.  The Company expects the asset allocation will continue to be outside of the target range through fiscal 2019.

The pension plans' fixed income portfolio is designed to match the duration and liquidity characteristics of the pension plans' liabilities.  In addition, the pension plans invest only in investment-grade debt securities to ensure preservation of capital.  The pension plans' equity portfolios are subject to diversification guidelines to reduce the impact of losses in single investments.  Investment managers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities and from the short selling of securities.

None of the pension plans' assets are directly invested in the Company's stock, although the pension plans may hold a minimal amount of Company stock to the extent of the Company's participation in equity indices.

The pension plans' investments included in Level 1 are valued using closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active exchanges.  The pension plans' investments included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service, which are reviewed by the Company for reasonableness.  To determine the fair value of our Level 2 plan assets, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information.  The pension plans have no Level 3 investments at

June 30, 2018

.

The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at

June 30, 2018

:

In addition to the investments in the above table, the pension plans also held cash and cash equivalents of

$13.2 million

as of

June 30, 2018

, which have been classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.


The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at

June 30, 2017

:

In addition to the investments in the above table, the pension plans also held cash and cash equivalents of

$15.2 million

as of

June 30, 2017

, which have been classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

Contributions

During fiscal


, the Company contributed

$10.9 million

to the pension plans.  The Company expects to contribute

$8.3 million

to the pension plans during fiscal 2019.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The benefits expected to be paid in each year from fiscal


to the year ended June 30,


are

$308.0 million

,

$148.8 million

,

$160.2 million

,

$100.3 million

, and

$107.7 million

, respectively.  The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the five fiscal years from the year ended June 30,


to the year ended June 30,


are

$669.4 million

.  The expected benefits to be paid are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company's pension plans' benefit obligations at

June 30, 2018

and includes estimated future employee service.

C. Retirement and Savings Plan.

The Company has a 401(k) retirement and savings plan, which allows eligible employees to contribute up to

50%

of their compensation annually and allows highly compensated employees to contribute up to

12%

of their compensation annually.  The Company matches a portion of employee contributions, which amounted to approximately

$100.6 million

,

$87.9 million

, and

$81.9 million

for the calendar years ended December 31,


,


, and


, respectively.

NOTE


. INCOME TAXES

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes shown below are based on the geographic location to which such earnings are attributable.


The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following components:

A reconciliation between the Company's effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate is as follows:

The effective tax rate for fiscal


and


was

25.3%

and

31.5%

, respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("the Act") and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2018, partially offset by prior period impacts of the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impact of a benefit due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit in fiscal 2017.

The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from

35%

to

21%

.  In accordance with ASC 740 companies are required to re-measure deferred tax balances using the new enacted tax rates.  The Act requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred for U.S. income taxes and creates new taxes on the Company's foreign sourced earnings.  The rate change is administratively effective at the beginning of the Company's fiscal year resulting in a blended corporate statutory tax rate for fiscal


of

28.1%

.

Income tax expense reported for fiscal


reflects the effects of the Act and includes a one-time net charge of

$1.6 million

.  The

$1.6 million

is comprised of foreign withholding taxes on future distributions, the one-time transition tax and the recording of a valuation allowance against the Company's foreign tax credits which may not be realized, partially offset by the application of the newly enacted rates to the Company's U.S. deferred tax balances. The Act’s foreign tax credit provisions may limit the Company’s ability to utilize existing foreign tax credits in future periods, accordingly we have estimated that approximately


$34.5 million

could expire unutilized. The Company has also accrued

$28.3 million

related to foreign withholding taxes on future distributions of earnings and profits ("E&P") that may not be utilizable as foreign tax credits.

In response to the Tax Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff issued a Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) that provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allows companies to record provisional amounts while the accounting impact of the Tax Act is still under analysis, not to extend beyond the measurement period of one year from the enactment of the Tax Act.

The accounting for the effects of the rate change on deferred tax balances is not complete and provisional amounts were recorded for these items.  The Company re-measured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future.  The benefit recorded relating to the re-measurement of the Company's deferred tax balances was

$68.0 million

.  The Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining calculations, which could potentially affect the re-measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts.

The one-time transition tax is based on the total post-1986 E&P that was previously deferred from US income taxes. The Company recorded a provisional amount for the one-time transition tax liability of

$22.9 million

for the Company's foreign subsidiaries.  The Company has not yet completed the calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from US federal taxation and finalizes the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.

The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are as follows:

There are

$90.1 million

and

$93.4 million

of long-term deferred tax assets included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at

June 30, 2018

and


, respectively.

Income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of approximately

$300.9 million

as of

June 30, 2018

, as the Company considers such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States.  The additional U.S. income tax that would arise on repatriation of the remaining undistributed


earnings could be offset, in part, by foreign tax credits on such repatriation.  However, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of net income tax that might be payable.

The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately

$62.7 million

as of

June 30, 2018

, of which

$4.8 million

expire through


and

$57.9 million

have an indefinite utilization period.  As of

June 30, 2018

, the Company has approximately

$61.7 million

of federal net operating loss carry-forwards from acquired companies.  The net operating losses have an annual utilization limitation pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and expire through


.

The Company has state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately

$255.4 million

as of

June 30, 2018

, which expire through


. The Company has recorded valuation allowances of

$46.0 million

and

$9.4 million

at

June 30, 2018

and


, respectively, to reflect the estimated amount of domestic and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized.

Income tax payments were approximately

$529.7 million

,

$817.1 million

, and

$651.6 million

for fiscal


,


, and


, respectively.

As of June 30,


,


, and


the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were

$45.2 million

,

$74.6 million

, and

$27.4 million

respectively.  The amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is

$36.1 million

,

$61.0 million

, and

$18.7 million

, respectively.  The remainder, if recognized, would principally impact deferred taxes.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Interest expense and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions have been recorded in the provision for income taxes on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.  During the fiscal years


,


, and


, the Company recorded interest expense (benefit) of

$3.2 million

,

$3.0 million

, and

$1.1 million

, respectively.  Penalties incurred during fiscal years


,


, and


were not significant.

At

June 30, 2018

, the Company had accrued interest of

$7.9 million

recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which

$4.8 million

was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities.  At June 30, 2017, the Company had accrued interest of

$6.9 million

recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which

$0.1 million

was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities.  At

June 30, 2018

, the Company had accrued penalties of

$0.3 million

recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other liabilities.  At June 30, 2017, the Company had accrued penalties of

$0.2 million

recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other liabilities.

The Company is routinely examined by the IRS and tax authorities in foreign countries in which it conducts business, as well as tax authorities in states in which it has significant business operations.  The tax years currently under examination vary by jurisdiction.  Examinations in progress in which the Company has significant business operations are as follows:


The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments resulting from examinations in each of the jurisdictions.  The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Company's Statements of Consolidated Earnings for a particular future period and on the Company's effective tax rate.

If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions.  Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to

$2 million

and expected cash payments could be up to

$25 million

in the next twelve months.  The liability related to cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months has been reclassified from other liabilities to current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty.  We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.

In fiscal


, the IRS completed its review of the examination of the Company's tax return for the years ended June 30, 2017 and


, which did not have a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.

NOTE


. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has obligations under various facilities and equipment leases. Minimum commitments under these obligations with a future life of greater than one year at

June 30, 2018

are as follows:

In addition to fixed rentals, certain leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices.

As of

June 30, 2018

, the Company has purchase commitments of appro

ximately

$576.3 million

, including a reinsurance premium with Chubb for the fiscal


policy year, as well as obligations related to software license agreements and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets, of which

$363.0 million

relates to fiscal


,

$113.6 million

relates to the fiscal year ending June 30,


, and the remaining relates to fiscal years ending June 30,


through fiscal


.

In June 2018, a potential class action complaint was filed against ADP in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.  The complaint asserts that ADP violated the Illinois Biometric Privacy Act, was negligent and unjustly enriched itself in connection with its collection, use and storage of biometric data of employees of its clients who are residents of Illinois in connection with certain services provided by ADP to clients in Illinois.  The complaint seeks statutory and other unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorney’s fees.  In addition, similar potential class action complaints have been filed in Illinois state courts against ADP and certain of its clients with respect to the collection, use and storage of biometric data of the employees of these


clients.  All of these claims are still in their earliest stages and the Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of loss, with respect to these matters.  The Company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits.

In July 2016, Uniloc USA, Inc. and Uniloc Luxembourg, S.A. (“Uniloc”) filed a lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the "Court") alleging that Company products and services infringe

four

patents.  Uniloc alleged infringement of its patents concerning centralized management of application programs on a network, distribution of application programs to a target station on a network, management of configurable application programs on a network, and license use management on a network.  The complaint sought unspecified monetary damages, costs, and injunctive relief.  On September 28, 2017, the Court granted ADP’s motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that all asserted claims of the

four

patents are invalid and dismissed the case with prejudice.

The Company has acquired a license to the

four

patents and a release for any potential past infringement liability.  Despite the Company being licensed and released, Uniloc appealed the Court's invalidity determination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Appeals Court”).  The Company moved to dismiss Uniloc's appeal; on August 2, 2018, the Appeals Court granted ADP’s motion, ending the lawsuit against ADP.

The Company is subject to various claims, litigation, and regulatory compliance matters in the normal course of business.  When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss.  Management currently believes that the resolution of these claims, litigation and regulatory compliance matters against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.

It is not the Company’s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements.  In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company’s services and products.  The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.

NOTE


.  RECLASSIFICATION OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS)/INCOME

Comprehensive income is a measure of income that includes both net earnings and other comprehensive income (loss).  Other comprehensive (loss)/income results from items deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in stockholders' equity.  Other comprehensive (loss)/income was

$(259.3) million

,

$(164.1) million

, and

$45.5 million

in fiscal


,


, and


, respectively.  Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss)/Income ("AOCI") by component are as follows:


(A) Reclassification adjustments out of AOCI are included within Other expense/(income), net, on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.

(B) Reclassification adjustments out of AOCI are included in net pension expense (see Note


).

(C) During fiscal 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2018-02 and reclassified stranded tax effects attributable to the Act from AOCI to retained earnings. The fiscal 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the reclassification out of accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income into retained earnings (see Note 1).


NOTE


. FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA

Based upon similar economic and operational characteristics, the Company’s strategic business units have been aggregated into the following

two

reportable segments: Employer Services and PEO Services.  The primary components of “Other” are non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, the elimination of intercompany transactions, interest expense, the results of operations of ADP Indemnity (a wholly-owned captive insurance company that provides workers’ compensation and employee’s liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services’ worksite employees), certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, and the historical results of the AMD business. Changes to the allocation methodology for certain allocations, has been adjusted in both the current period and the prior period in the table below, and did not materially affect reportable segment results.  The Company also adjusted the segment results to reflect the historical results of AMD in Other, which also did not materially affect reportable segment results. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") will begin reviewing segment results reported at actual interest rates and the results of the PEO segment inclusive of the results of ADP Indemnity.  Additionally, the CODM will begin reviewing results with changes to certain corporate allocations.  These changes represent a change in the measure of segment performance.  The Company will reflect these new segment measures beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and prior period segment results will be restated for comparability.

Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons.  Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility.  There is a reconciling item for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of

4.5%

.  This allocation is made for management reasons so that the reportable segments' results are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in interest rates.  This reconciling adjustment to the reportable segments' revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes is eliminated in consolidation.


The Company has reclassified

$223.0 million

and

$240.9 million

of revenues previously reported within Other for fiscal years


and 2016, respectively, to United States to properly reflect revenues by geography.  This revision did not impact segment profit or consolidated revenue results.  Management has concluded that the impact was not material to any period presented.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are certifications of ADP's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). This “Controls and Procedures” section should be read in conjunction with the report of Deloitte & Touche LLP that appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company carried out an evaluation (the “evaluation”), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

June 30, 2018

in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

It is the responsibility of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.'s (“ADP”) management to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to ADP's management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

ADP's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADP are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADP's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of ADP.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of ADP’s internal control over financial reporting as of

June 30, 2018

based upon criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management determined that ADP’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

June 30, 2018

.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of ADP included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the operating effectiveness of ADP's internal control over financial reporting. The Deloitte & Touche LLP attestation report is set forth below.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

Roseland, New Jersey

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, of the Company and our report dated August 3, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
