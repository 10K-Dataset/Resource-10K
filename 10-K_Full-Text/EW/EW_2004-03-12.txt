Overview

Edwards Lifesciences Corporation is a global leader in products and technologies designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. Edwards Lifesciences focuses
on providing products and technologies to address four main cardiovascular disease states:

•

heart
valve disease;

•

coronary
artery disease;

•

peripheral
vascular disease; and

•

congestive
heart failure.

Cardiovascular
disease is the number-one cause of death in the world, and is among the top three diseases in terms of health care spending in nearly every country.
Cardiovascular disease is both progressive and pervasive; progressive, in that it tends to worsen over time, and pervasive because it often affects an individual's entire circulatory system. In its
later stages, cardiovascular disease is frequently treated with surgery, including heart valve replacement or repair procedures and coronary artery bypass graft ("CABG") procedures.

The
products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat cardiovascular disease are categorized into five main areas: Cardiac Surgery; Critical Care; Vascular; Perfusion;
and Other Distributed Products.

Patients
undergoing surgical treatment for cardiovascular disease are likely to be treated using a variety of Edwards Lifesciences' products and technologies. For example, an individual
with a heart valve disorder may have a faulty valve re-shaped and repaired with an Edwards Lifesciences annuloplasty ring, or the surgeon may elect to remove the valve altogether and
replace it with one of Edwards Lifesciences' bioprosthetic tissue heart valves, which are made of bovine or porcine tissue. Virtually all high-risk patients in the operating room or
cardiac care unit are candidates for having their cardiac function monitored by Edwards Lifesciences' critical care products. If the circulatory problems are in the limbs rather than in the heart, the
patient's procedure may involve some of Edwards Lifesciences' vascular products, which include various types of balloon-tipped catheters that are used to remove blood clots, and stents that are used
to prop open the diseased blood vessels of patients suffering from atherosclerotic vascular disease. If a patient undergoes other types of open-heart surgery, such as a CABG procedure, the
functions of their heart and lungs may be managed through the use of disposable products and equipment offered in certain international markets by Edwards

Lifesciences'
perfusion product line. Lastly, Edwards Lifesciences' other distributed products include sales of intra-aortic balloon pumps, pacemakers, angioplasty systems and other products sold
primarily through the Company's distribution network in Japan.

Corporate Background

Edwards Lifesciences Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on September 10, 1999 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter International Inc.
("Baxter") to assume the business and operations of Baxter's CardioVascular Group. On March 31, 2000, Edwards Lifesciences was spun-off from Baxter and became an independent
company. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the "Company" and "Edwards Lifesciences" refer to Baxter's CardioVascular Group for periods prior to April 1, 2000 and to Edwards
Lifesciences Corporation and its subsidiaries for the periods on or after such date. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the terms "it," "its," "Company" and "Edwards
Lifesciences" refer to Edwards Lifesciences Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Edwards
Lifesciences' principal executive offices are located at One Edwards Way, Irvine, California 92614. The telephone number at that address is (949) 250-2500. The
Company makes available, free of charge on its web site located at www.edwards.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports with the SEC. The Company's corporate governance guidelines,
audit and public policy committee charter, compensation and nominating committee charter, and code of business conduct ethics are posted on the Company's web site, the address of which is
www.edwards.com, and are each available in print to any shareholder upon request by writing to: Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Investor Relations, One Edwards Way, Irvine, California 92614.

Edwards Lifesciences' Product and Technology Offerings

The following discussion summarizes the five main categories of products and technologies offered by Edwards Lifesciences to treat advanced cardiovascular
disease. For more information on net sales from these five main categories, see "Net Sales by Product Line" under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In order to provide greater visibility to a key part of its business, beginning in January 2004, the Company will recategorize its products into the following five areas: Heart Valve Therapy;
Cardiac Surgery Systems; Critical Care; Vascular; and Other Distributed Products.

Cardiac Surgery

Heart Valve Therapy.

Edwards Lifesciences is the world's leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves
and repair products, which are used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve. The Company operates manufacturing facilities in Irvine, California, and Horw, Switzerland,
producing pericardial and porcine valves from biologically inert animal tissue sewn onto proprietary wireform stents.

The
core of Edwards Lifesciences' tissue product line is the

Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT

pericardial valve, including

PERIMOUNT Magna

, the newest generation
pericardial valve approved for sale in the United States, Europe and Canada. The

PERIMOUNT

valve is the most widely prescribed tissue heart valve in the world due to its proven durability and
performance, and is the only pericardial
valve available in the United States. Edwards Lifesciences'

Carpentier-Edwards

porcine valves,

Edwards Prima
Plus

stentless tissue valve,

Edwards MIRA

bi-leaflet mechanical valve, and

Starr-
Edwards

silastic ball valve complement its line of heart valves

.

In
addition to its replacement valves, Edwards Lifesciences is the worldwide leader in heart valve repair therapies with products including its

Carpentier-Edwards

annuloplasty rings,

Cosgrove-Edwards


annuloplasty
system,

Edwards MC


Tricuspid

annuloplasty system, and recently introduced

Carpentier-McCarthy-Adams
IMR ETlogix

annuloplasty system.

The
Company is currently developing technologies for the percutaneous (catheter-based) repair and replacement of heart valves.

Beginning
in 2004, the following products currently in Cardiac Surgery will be included in Cardiac Surgery Systems:

Cannula.

The Company is a leading manufacturer of select disposable products used during cardiac
surgery including cannula to facilitate vacuum-assisted venous drainage during perfusion, and aortic dispersion cannula. Edwards Lifesciences also has a number of products to facilitate coronary
artery bypass surgery when performed on a beating heart, including the

AnastaFlo

coronary shunt used to redirect blood away from the suturing site, and
the

VisuFlo

humidifying blower to keep the surgical site dry and optimize the surgeon's visual field during a cardiothoracic surgical procedure.

Angina Therapy.

Edwards Lifesciences distributes carbon-dioxide lasers and related disposables for
use in transmyocardial revascularization ("TMR"), a procedure for treating severe angina. These products are manufactured by PLC Systems Inc., and Edwards Lifesciences is responsible for all
sales, marketing and distribution of these products in the United States.

Cardiac Tissue Ablation.

The Company has partnered with PLC Systems Inc. to commercialize the

Optimaze

surgical ablation system, a photonic laser system for treating cardiac arrhythmias. Approximately 2.2 million Americans suffer from
atrial fibrillation, the most common and serious type of cardiac arrhythmia. PLC Systems Inc. is responsible for ongoing product development and manufacturing of the

Optimaze

system and disposable
components, while Edwards Lifesciences is responsible for worldwide, sales, marketing and distribution of these products.
The Company plans to begin market introduction of

Optimaze

in the second half of 2004.

Embolic Management.

Edwards Lifesciences produces the

EMBOL-X
Intra-Aortic Embolic Management System,

the only system of its kind designed to capture embolic material, such as blood clots or tissue fragments that might be generated during
open-heart surgery procedures.

Critical Care

Edwards Lifesciences is a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems that are used to measure a patient's heart function in surgical and intensive care
settings. Hemodynamic monitoring enables a clinician to balance the oxygen supply and demand of a critically ill patient and plays an important role in assuring that the heart function of millions of
patients who have pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or other critical illnesses is optimized before they undergo a surgical procedure.

Edwards
Lifesciences' hemodynamic monitoring technologies are often deployed before, during and after open-heart, major vascular, major abdominal, neurological and orthopedic
surgical procedures. Edwards Lifesciences manufactures and markets the

Swan-Ganz

brand line of hemodynamic monitoring products, originally
launched in the 1970s. The latest evolution in the

Swan-Ganz

product line is the

CCOmbo V

catheter. The

CCOmbo V

catheter adds a proprietary continuous volume measurement to the series of continuous parameters already integrated into the
device, most notably cardiac output and venous oxygen saturation. Edwards Lifesciences' most recent addition to its hemodynamic monitoring product line is the

PreSep

central venous oximetry catheter,
designed to help clinicians identify and manage sepsis, a widespread blood infection that is believed to affect
as many as 18 million people worldwide each year.

Edwards
Lifesciences is also a global leader in the broader field of disposable pressure monitoring devices and has a line of innovative products enabling closed-loop
arterial blood sampling to protect


both
patients and clinicians from the risk of infection. Central venous catheters are the primary route for fluid and medication delivery to patients undergoing major surgical procedures and/or
intensive care. The Company's

Advanced Venous Access

products, marketed under the

AVA HF

and

AVA 3Xi

brand
names, provide increased convenience, effectiveness and efficiency by integrating the capabilities of an introducer and multi-lumen
central venous access into a single device. Edwards Lifesciences'

Vantex

central venous catheter, which is manufactured from a patented, antimicrobial
material, addresses the potentially life-threatening and costly problems of bloodstream infections.

The
Company also markets a range of products required to perform continuous renal replacement therapies including access catheters, hemofilters, substitution fluids and pumps.

Vascular

The pervasive nature of cardiovascular disease means that the circulatory conditions that occur inside the heart are often mirrored elsewhere in a patient's body.
Atherosclerotic disease is one common condition that involves the thickening of blood-carrying vessels and the formation of circulation-restricting plaque, clots and other substances, and often occurs
concurrently in the vascular system as well as in the heart. When the abdomen, arms or legs are impacted, the diagnosis is usually peripheral vascular disease ("PVD"), which occurs in millions of
patients worldwide.

Edwards
Lifesciences manufactures and sells a variety of products used to treat occlusive PVD, including a line of balloon-tipped, catheter-based products, as well as surgical clips and
inserts, angioscopy equipment and artificial implantable grafts. Edwards Lifesciences'

Fogarty

line of embolectomy catheters has been an industry
standard for removing blood clots from peripheral blood vessels for more than 40 years.

Edwards
Lifesciences has developed the

Lifepath AAA

endovascular graft system to less invasively treat abdominal aortic aneurysms. The

Lifepath AAA

system is
currently being sold in Europe. The Company announced in December 2003 its intent to explore strategic alternatives for
this program.

In
2003, Edwards Lifesciences introduced its balloon-expandable

LifeStent

systems, the first in a series of new non-coronary
stent offerings that are used to prop open the diseased blood
vessels of patients suffering from atherosclerotic vascular disease. The Company expects to continue introducing balloon-expandable and self-expanding LifeStent products throughout 2004.

Perfusion

Edwards Lifesciences develops, manufactures and distributes a line of disposable perfusion products for customers in regions outside of the United States and
Western Europe. These products include the

Edwards Vital

oxygenator and various blood containers, filters and related devices used during the practice
of bypassing the heart and lungs during open-heart surgical procedures. Edwards Lifesciences operates an oxygenator manufacturing facility in Brazil.

Other Distributed Products

Other distributed products include sales of intra-aortic balloon pumps, pacemakers, angioplasty systems and other products sold though the Company's operations in
Japan, and miscellaneous pharmaceutical products sold in the United States.

Competition

The medical devices industry is highly competitive. Edwards Lifesciences competes with many companies, ranging from small start-up enterprises to
companies that are larger and more established than Edwards Lifesciences with access to significant financial resources. Furthermore, rapid product development and technological change characterize
the market in which Edwards Lifesciences


competes.
The present or future products of Edwards Lifesciences could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of Edwards Lifesciences' present or
future competitors or by other therapies, including drug therapies. Edwards Lifesciences must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular
medical devices industry. Edwards Lifesciences believes that it competes primarily on the basis of product reliability and performance, product features that enhance patient benefit, customer and
sales support, and cost-effectiveness.

The
cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic and currently undergoing significant change due to cost-of-care considerations, regulatory
reform, industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs. The ability to provide cost-effective products and technologies that improve clinical outcomes is becoming
increasingly important for medical device manufacturers.

Edwards
Lifesciences' products and technologies face substantial competition from a number of companies. In cardiac surgery, the primary competitors include St. Jude
Medical, Inc., Medtronic, Inc. and the Sorin Group. In critical care, Edwards Lifesciences' principal competitors include Abbott Laboratories and Arrow International, Inc. In
vascular, Edwards Lifesciences' primary competitors for the traditional surgical segments of its business include W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc. and Applied Medical Resources Corporation.
For emerging peripheral vascular disease products, Edwards Lifesciences' competitors are, or are expected to be, Boston Scientific Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Guidant Corporation and
Medtronic, Inc. In perfusion, Edwards Lifesciences competes with the Sorin Group, Medtronic, Inc. and Jostra AG.

Sales and Marketing

Edwards Lifesciences has a number of broad product lines that require a sales and marketing strategy tailored to its customers in order to deliver
high-quality, cost-effective products and technologies to all of its customers worldwide. Edwards Lifesciences' portfolio includes some of the most recognizable product brands
in cardiovascular devices today, including

Carpentier-Edwards, Cosgrove-Edwards, Fogarty, Research Medical, Starr-Edwards

and

Swan-Ganz

.

Because
of the diverse global needs of the population that Edwards Lifesciences serves, Edwards Lifesciences' distribution system includes a direct sales force and independent
distributors. Edwards Lifesciences is not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Edwards Lifesciences' net sales in 2003.

Sales
personnel work closely with the primary decision makers who purchase Edwards Lifesciences' products, which include physicians, material managers, nurses, biomedical staff, hospital
administrators and purchasing managers. Also, where appropriate, Edwards Lifesciences' sales force actively pursues approval of Edwards Lifesciences as a qualified supplier for hospital group
purchasing organizations that negotiate contracts with suppliers of medical products. Edwards Lifesciences has contracts with a number of domestic national buying groups and is working with a growing
number of regional buying groups that are emerging in response to cost containment pressures and health care reform in the United States.

United States.

In the United States, Edwards Lifesciences sells substantially all of its products
through its direct sales force. Substantially all of its direct sales force consists of employees of Edwards
Lifesciences. In 2003, 44.7% of Edwards Lifesciences' reported sales were derived from sales to customers in the United States.

International.

In 2003, 55.3% of Edwards Lifesciences' reported sales were derived internationally
through its direct sales force and independent distributors. Edwards Lifesciences sells its products in approximately 100 countries. Major international markets for Edwards Lifesciences' products are:
Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, Canada, Belgium, Spain, The Netherlands and


Australia/New
Zealand. The sales and marketing approach in international geographies varies depending on each country's size and state of development. See Note 18 to the "Consolidated Financial
Statements" contained herein for additional information.

Raw Materials and Manufacturing

Edwards Lifesciences uses a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials in the design, development and manufacture of its products. Edwards Lifesciences'
non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics and metal. Most of Edwards Lifesciences' heart valve therapy
products are manufactured from natural tissues harvested from animal tissue, as well as man-made materials. Edwards Lifesciences purchases certain materials and components used in
manufacturing its products from external suppliers. In addition, Edwards Lifesciences purchases certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability, cost
effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.

Edwards
Lifesciences works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Alternative supplier options are generally considered
and identified, although Edwards Lifesciences does not typically pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of its existing supplier relationships and the time and
expense associated with the regulatory validation process. Although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by Edwards Lifesciences in circumstances where the items
supplied are integral to the performance of Edwards Lifesciences' products or incorporate unique technology, management does not believe that the loss of any existing supply contract would have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

Edwards
Lifesciences follows rigorous sourcing and manufacturing procedures intended to safeguard humans from potential risks associated with diseases such as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy ("BSE"), commonly known as "mad cow disease." International health and regulatory authorities have given guidance identifying three factors contributing to the control of BSE: source of
animals, nature of
tissue used and manufacturing process. The Company complies with all current global guidelines regarding risks for products intended to be implanted in humans. The Company obtains bovine tissue used
in its pericardial tissue valve products only from sources within the United States, where strong control measures and surveillance programs exist. In addition, bovine tissue used in the Company's
pericardial tissue valve products are from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility. The Company's manufacturing and sterilization
processes render tissue biologically safe from all known infectious agents and viruses, and exceed the worldwide standard for sterile medical products. See "Risk Factors" contained herein.

Quality Assurance

Edwards Lifesciences is committed to providing quality products to its customers. To meet this commitment, Edwards Lifesciences has implemented modern quality
systems and concepts throughout the organization. The quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification processes
and the manufacturing, sales and servicing of the product. The quality system is designed to build in quality and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product lifecycle.

Edwards
Lifesciences' operations are certified under applicable international quality systems standards, such as ISO 9001, ISO 9002 and ISO 13485. These standards require, among other
items, quality system controls that are applied to product design, component material, suppliers and manufacturing operations. These ISO certifications can be obtained only after a complete audit of a
company's quality system has been conducted by an independent outside auditor. Periodic reexamination by an independent outside auditor is required to maintain these certifications.


Research and Development

Edwards Lifesciences is engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety
and reliability of its current leading products and to expand the applications of its products as appropriate. Edwards Lifesciences is dedicated to developing novel technologies that will furnish
health care providers with a more complete line of products to treat heart valve disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and congestive heart failure.

The
Company spent $72.8 million on research and development in 2003, $65.2 million in 2002 and $55.0 million in 2001 (8.5%, 9.3% and 7.9% of net sales,
respectively). A significant portion of Edwards Lifesciences' research and development investment has been applied to extend and defend its core cardiac surgery, critical care and vascular franchises,
including research and development relating to next-generation pericardial tissue valves and enhanced tissue processing technologies.

Edwards
Lifesciences is investing in the development of percutaneous heart valve repair and replacement technologies, designed to treat heart valve disease using a catheter-based
approach as opposed to direct surgical techniques. In 2003, the Company acquired the intellectual property and assets of Jomed's percutaneous heart valve repair program, and in January 2004
acquired Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc., a privately held firm with notable clinical experience and intellectual property relating to a percutaneous heart valve replacement system. Both
acquisitions enhanced the Company's existing percutaneous repair and replacement development efforts.

The
Company is also pursuing the development of minimally invasive cardiac output ("MICO") monitoring systems, which offer the promise of collecting critical data using less invasive
methods than current technologies. Additionally, the Company is investing in activities designed to create new growth platforms including peripheral stents, laser-based photonic ablation to treat
cardiac arrhythmia, tissue-engineered heart valves, and angiogenesis gene therapy treatment for coronary artery and peripheral vascular diseases.

Edwards
Lifesciences' research and development activities are carried out primarily in facilities located in the United States. The Company's experienced research and development staff
is focused on product design and development, quality, clinical research and regulatory compliance. To pursue primary research efforts, Edwards Lifesciences has developed alliances with several
leading research institutions and universities, and also works with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies
on Edwards Lifesciences' existing and developing products. These studies include clinical trials, which provide data for use in regulatory submissions, and post-market approval studies
involving applications of Edwards Lifesciences' products.

Proprietary Technology

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the success of Edwards Lifesciences' business. Edwards Lifesciences also relies upon trade secrets,
know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position.

Edwards
Lifesciences owns approximately 450 issued United States patents, 190 pending United States patent applications, 740 issued foreign patents and 500 pending foreign patent
applications, and has licensed numerous United States patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of Edwards Lifesciences' products.

Most
of Edwards Lifesciences' products are protected in some way by issued patents and/or pending patent applications. Although the original

Carpentier-Edwards

pericardial valve patent expired in 2002 in
most countries, Edwards Lifesciences has a number of other key patents and pending patent
applications in the United States, Europe, Australia, Japan and Canada on improvements to the pericardial valve that enhance and extend the original patent coverage. Because of these design


improvements,
management does not expect the expiration of the original pericardial patent to have a significant effect on its business. Edwards Lifesciences also has many important United States and
foreign patents and pending patent applications related to mitral valve repair and, in particular, patent coverage on the

Cosgrove-Edwards

annuloplasty
system and the

Carpentier-Edwards Physio

annuloplasty ring, as well as the

Edwards MC


tricuspid annuloplasty system and the

IMR ETlogix

annuloplasty ring. Edwards Lifesciences also has a number of significant United States and foreign
patents and patent applications in the field of percutaneous heart valve repair and replacement. In addition, Edwards Lifesciences has a number of key United States and foreign patents and patent
applications that cover catheters, systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring, including measuring and monitoring continuous cardiac output ("CCO") and vascular access products, including
combinations of introducers and central venous catheters. Many of the CCO and vascular access patents were issued within the past few years and are expected to protect Edwards Lifesciences'
intellectual property rights in such technologies for the next 8 to 16 years. Edwards Lifesciences also owns a significant number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications
relating to intra-aortic embolic management systems, including the

EMBOL-X

system. The

Lifepath
AAA

system for endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms is protected by approximately 20 issued United States patents and numerous issued patents and foreign patent
applications pending in Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia. Edwards Lifesciences has also exclusively licensed and owns several important United States and foreign patents and patent applications
relating to peripheral stents, including the

LifeStent

products. In addition, Edwards Lifesciences has exclusively licensed an extensive portfolio of
United States and foreign patents and patent applications in the angiogenesis field.

Although
some of Edwards Lifesciences' patents are due to expire within the next five years, Edwards Lifesciences' patent strategy is to file improvement patent applications and, in some
cases, additional patent applications covering new aspects or modifications of the affected products, or line extensions of these products. As a result, the duration of some of the patents covering
Edwards Lifesciences' products can extend up to 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application. Edwards Lifesciences management does not believe that the expiration of any one or
more of its patents that are due to expire in the next five years will cause a material adverse effect on the sales of Edwards Lifesciences' products. In addition, Edwards Lifesciences is a party to
several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which it has obtained, for varying terms, the exclusive or non-exclusive rights to certain patents held by such third
parties in consideration for cross licensing rights or royalty payments. Edwards Lifesciences has also granted various rights in its own patents to others under license agreements. There can be no
assurance that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. Competitors may challenge the validity and enforceability of, or circumvent, these patents issued to or licensed by Edwards
Lifesciences. Such patents may also be found to be insufficiently broad to provide Edwards Lifesciences with a competitive advantage.

Edwards
Lifesciences actively monitors the products of its competitors for possible infringement of Edwards Lifesciences' owned and/or licensed patents. Although litigation has been
necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by Edwards Lifesciences, the Company plans to continue to defend and prosecute its rights with respect to such patents. However, the Company's efforts
in this regard may not be successful. In addition, patent litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of effort. Edwards Lifesciences also relies upon trade secrets for protection of its
confidential and proprietary information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, and third parties may otherwise gain access to Edwards
Lifesciences' trade secrets.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has
responsibility for regulating the introduction of new medical devices. The FDA regulates laboratory and manufacturing practices, labeling and record-keeping for medical devices, and review of required
manufacturers' reports of adverse experience to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Many of the devices that Edwards Lifesciences develops and markets are in a category for
which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market approval requirements. The process of obtaining FDA approval to market a product can be resource-intensive,
lengthy and costly. FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of Edwards Lifesciences' products. Any delay or acceleration experienced by Edwards
Lifesciences in obtaining regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials or in obtaining required market clearances
(especially with respect to significant products in the regulatory process that have been discussed in public announcements) may affect Edwards Lifesciences' operations or the market's expectations
for the timing of such events and, consequently, the market price for Edwards Lifesciences' common stock. The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize
adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or order the repair, replacement or refund of the costs of such devices. The FDA also may require notification of health professionals and others with regard
to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may enjoin and restrain certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical
Devices Act pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Moreover, the FDA administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the
United States and the importation of devices into the United States.

Medical
device laws are also in effect in countries outside of the United States where Edwards Lifesciences does business. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for
some or all of Edwards Lifesciences' medical device products to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing.


Edwards
Lifesciences is also governed by federal, state, local and foreign laws of general applicability, such as those regulating employee health and safety. In addition, Edwards
Lifesciences is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the adverse impact of material on the environment.

Health Care Initiatives.

Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care
costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are continuing in many countries where Edwards Lifesciences does business, including the United States and Japan. As a result of these
changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. Although Edwards Lifesciences believes it is well positioned to respond to
changes resulting from this worldwide trend toward cost containment, proposed legislation and/or changes in the marketplace could have an adverse impact on future operating results.

Diagnostic-related
groups' reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government, through the Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare. In response to rising Medicare and Medicaid costs, several legislative proposals in the United States have
been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for these programs. While Edwards Lifesciences has been unaware of significant domestic price resistance directly as a result of the
reimbursement policies of diagnostic-related groups, changes in these reimbursement levels and processes could have an adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' domestic pricing flexibility.

In
keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in health care delivery, the current trend among domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device
manufacturers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range
of products to large purchasers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past. The enhanced purchasing
power of these larger customers may also increase the pressure on product pricing, although management is unable to estimate the potential impact at this time.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, Edwards Lifesciences had approximately 5,000 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located at the Company's headquarters
in Irvine, California, and at its manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. Other major concentrations of employees are located in the Dominican Republic, Europe, Japan and Brazil. Edwards Lifesciences
emphasizes competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation and work environment practices in its efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel. None of Edwards Lifesciences' North
American employees are represented by a labor union. In various countries outside of North America, the Company interacts with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of
employees. Edwards Lifesciences has a very engaged workforce as measured by the Gallup Employee Engagement Survey.


Risk Factors

You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in Edwards Lifesciences' filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of the events described below occurs, Edwards Lifesciences' business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In that case,
the value of Edwards Lifesciences' securities could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment.

If Edwards Lifesciences does not introduce new products in a timely manner, its products may become obsolete, and its operating results may suffer.

The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. Without
the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, Edwards Lifesciences' products will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case its revenue and operating results would
suffer. Even if Edwards Lifesciences is able to develop new technologies, these technologies may not be accepted quickly because of industry specific factors, such as the need for regulatory
clearance, unanticipated restrictions imposed on approved indications, entrenched patterns of clinical practice and uncertainty over third party reimbursement

Moreover,
significant technical innovations generally will require a substantial investment before Edwards Lifesciences can determine the commercial viability of these innovations.
Edwards Lifesciences may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these technical innovations. In addition, even if Edwards Lifesciences is able to successfully develop enhancements or new
generations of its products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing
customer preferences or the introduction by Edwards Lifesciences' competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.

Edwards Lifesciences may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect its operating results.

Edwards Lifesciences' business exposes it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices.
Edwards Lifesciences' products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients. In addition, some of the medical devices manufactured and sold by Edwards
Lifesciences are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time. Edwards Lifesciences could be the subject of product liability suits alleging that component failures,
manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. Product liability
lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' business and reputation and on
its ability to attract and retain customers.

Edwards Lifesciences may experience supply interruptions that could harm its ability to manufacture products.

Edwards Lifesciences use a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of its products. Edwards
Lifesciences' non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics and metals. Edwards Lifesciences' heart valve
therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and man-made materials. Edwards Lifesciences purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture
of its products from external suppliers. In addition, Edwards Lifesciences purchases certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness or
constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. Edwards Lifesciences work closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Alternative
supplier options are


generally
considered and identified, although Edwards Lifesciences does not typically pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of its existing supplier relationships
and the time and expense associated with this regulatory process. Although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by Edwards Lifesciences in circumstances where the items
supplied are integral to the performance of its products or incorporate unique technology, management does not believe that the loss of any existing supply contract would have a material adverse
effect on the Company.

In
an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure, in the past certain suppliers have announced that they might limit or terminate sales of certain materials and parts to
companies that manufacture implantable medical devices. In some cases, Edwards Lifesciences has been required to indemnify suppliers for product liability expenses in order to continue to receive
materials or parts. There can be no assurance that an indemnity from Edwards Lifesciences will be satisfactory to these suppliers in the future. If Edwards Lifesciences is unable to obtain these raw
materials or there is a significant increase in the price of materials or components, its business could be harmed.

Edwards Lifesciences may be required to recognize additional charges in connection with the write-down of some of its investments, the disposition of some of its
businesses or for other reasons.

Edwards Lifesciences has made investments in the equity instruments of other companies, and may make further such investments in the future. To the extent that
the value of any such investment declines, Edwards Lifesciences may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment. For example, in September 2002, Edwards
Lifesciences recorded a $67.4 million pretax charge related to the impairment of its investment in the preferred stock of World Heart Corporation.
See "Asset Impairments" under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included herein.

In
the case of some of the companies in which Edwards Lifesciences has invested, the value of its equity securities has declined since the time of its original investment. As a result,
Edwards Lifesciences may be required to recognize additional charges, which could be substantial, to write down its investments. At December 31, 2003, in addition to its investment in World
Heart, which was $11.6 million, Edwards Lifesciences had approximately $23.8 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of
$4.3 million and unrealized losses of $4.8 million on these investments on its balance sheet in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income," net of tax.

As
part of the ongoing evaluation of its various businesses and products, Edwards Lifesciences from time to time identifies businesses or products that are not performing at a level
commensurate with the rest of its business. Edwards Lifesciences may from time to time seek to dispose of these under performing businesses or product lines, and may also seek to dispose of businesses
or product lines from time to time for strategic or other business reasons. If Edwards Lifesciences is unable to dispose of a business or product line on terms it considers acceptable, Edwards
Lifesciences may voluntarily terminate that business or cease providing that product. Any of these events may result in charges, which could be substantial and which could adversely affect its results
of operations.

Edwards
Lifesciences has entered into interest rate swap agreements in connection with some of its indebtedness, and expects that it will continue to do so from time to time in the
future. In the event that Edwards Lifesciences elects to terminate a swap agreement prior to its maturity, it may be required to make cash payments to the counterparty and to recognize a charge in
connection with that termination, which could adversely affect its results of operations.


Edwards Lifesciences may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any
acquisitions or alliances.

As part of Edwards Lifesciences' growth strategy, Edwards Lifesciences regularly reviews potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies,
services or products and potential strategic alliances. Edwards Lifesciences may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form partnerships or strategic
alliances. Even if Edwards Lifesciences identifies appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, it may be unable to complete such acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all. In
addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into Edwards Lifesciences' existing business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties
and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may require significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of Edwards Lifesciences' business.
Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or strategic alliance, and such transactions may not generate anticipated financial results. In addition,
Edwards Lifesciences may be required to take charges or write-downs in connection with acquisitions it have made or may make in the future. Future acquisitions could also require issuances of equity
securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could harm Edwards Lifesciences' business.

Edwards Lifesciences business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations.

Because Edwards Lifesciences sells its products in a number of foreign countries, its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
Edwards Lifesciences' net sales originating outside of the United States, as a percentage of total net sales, were 55.3% in 2003. Edwards Lifesciences anticipates that sales from international
operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of its total sales. In addition, many of Edwards Lifesciences' manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United
States. Management expects to increase Edwards Lifesciences' international sales, which could expose it to greater risks associated with international sales and operations. Accordingly, Edwards
Lifesciences future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

•

changes
in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

•

unexpected
changes in foreign regulatory requirements;

•

changes
in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

changes
in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging regions;

•

trade
protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

•

potentially
negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

•

difficulty
in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

changes
in the international political situation;

•

differing
labor regulations; and

•

differing
protection of intellectual property.

Edwards Lifesciences is subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Edwards Lifesciences generated 55.3% of net sales in 2003 outside of the United States. Substantially all of Edwards Lifesciences' sales outside of the United
States are denominated in local


currencies.
Measured in local currency, a substantial portion of Edwards Lifesciences' foreign generated sales was generated in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan. The United
States dollar value of Edwards Lifesciences' foreign generated sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant decreases in the value of the United States dollar to the Euro or the
Japanese yen have had the effect of increasing Edwards Lifesciences' earnings even when the volume of foreign sales has remained constant. Significant increases in the value of the United States
dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, could have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' results of operations. Edwards Lifesciences has a hedging
program that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and cost; however,
this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Fluctuations in Edwards Lifesciences' quarterly operating results may cause its stock price to decline.

Edwards Lifesciences sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. A high proportion of Edwards Lifesciences' costs are fixed, due
in part to significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter, and the price of Edwards
Lifesciences' common stock may fall. Other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include:

•

demand
for and clinical acceptance of products;

•

the
timing and execution of customer contracts, particularly large contracts that would materially affect Edwards Lifesciences' operating results in a given quarter;

•

the
timing of sales of products;

•

changes
in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

unanticipated
delays or problems in introducing new products;

•

competitors'
announcements of new products, services or technological innovations;

•

changes
in Edwards Lifesciences' pricing policies or the pricing policies of its competitors;

•

increased
expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, product development or administration;

•

adverse
changes in the level of economic activity in the United States and other major regions in which Edwards Lifesciences does business;

•

costs
related to possible acquisitions of technologies or businesses;

•

Edwards
Lifesciences ability to expand its operations; and

•

the
amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of Edwards Lifesciences' operations.

Edwards Lifesciences inability to protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on its business.

Edwards Lifesciences' success and competitive position are dependent, in part, upon its proprietary intellectual property. Edwards Lifesciences relies on a
combination of patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect its proprietary intellectual property, and will continue to do so. Although Edwards Lifesciences seeks to protect its
proprietary rights through a variety of means, Edwards Lifesciences cannot guarantee that the protective steps it has taken are adequate to protect these rights. Patents issued to or licensed by
Edwards Lifesciences in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid or not infringed by third parties. Competitors may also challenge Edwards Lifesciences' patents. In addition,
certain of Edwards Lifesciences' patents are due to expire within the


next
five years and it may be unsuccessful in its efforts to extend these patents through improvement patents, modifications or line extensions. The failure to maintain Edwards Lifesciences' patents
could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Edwards
Lifesciences also relies on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
These agreements could be breached and Edwards Lifesciences may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary
information or gain access to Edwards Lifesciences' trade secrets or proprietary information. Edwards Lifesciences spends significant resources to monitor and enforce its intellectual property rights.
However, Edwards Lifesciences may not be able to detect infringement and may lose its competitive position in the industry. In addition, competitors may design around Edwards Lifesciences' technology
or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market
position.

Third parties may claim Edwards Lifesciences is infringing their intellectual property, and Edwards Lifesciences could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be
prevented from selling products.

During recent years, Edwards Lifesciences' competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the
medical device industry generally. From time to time, Edwards Lifesciences may be forced to defend itself against other claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property
rights of others. Because intellectual property litigation can be costly and time consuming, Edwards Lifesciences' intellectual property litigation expenses could be significant. Adverse
determinations in any such litigation could subject Edwards Lifesciences to significant liabilities to third parties, could require Edwards Lifesciences to seek licenses
from third parties and could, if such licenses are not available, prevent it from manufacturing, selling or using certain of its products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company.

Third
parties could also obtain patents that may require Edwards Lifesciences to either redesign its products or, if possible, negotiate licenses to conduct its business. If Edwards
Lifesciences is unable to redesign its products or obtain a license, Edwards Lifesciences may have to exit a particular product offering.

Edwards Lifesciences faces intense competition and consolidation within its industry, and if Edwards Lifesciences does not compete effectively, its business will be harmed.

The
cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive. Edwards Lifesciences competes with many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, better brand or name
recognition and greater access to financial and other resources than Edwards Lifesciences. Furthermore, the industry is characterized by intensive development efforts and rapidly advancing technology.
Edwards Lifesciences' present and future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of its current or future competitors or by alternative therapies,
including drug therapies. See "Business—Competition" included herein. Edwards Lifesciences' future success will depend, in large part, on its ability to develop and acquire new products
and technologies, anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies.

The
medical device industry has been consolidating and, as a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts. The
enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers may also increase downward pressure on product pricing. In addition, many existing and potential domestic customers for Edwards Lifesciences'
products have combined to form group purchasing organizations, or "GPOs." GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made
available to members of GPOs. If Edwards Lifesciences is not one of the providers selected by a GPO, it may be precluded


from
making sales to members of a GPO for several years. Even if Edwards Lifesciences is one of the selected providers, it may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able
to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies. Further, Edwards Lifesciences may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect
on its sales and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Edwards Lifesciences and its customers are subject to various governmental regulations, and Edwards Lifesciences may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations
and develop its products to be compatible with these regulations.

The
medical devices manufactured and marketed by Edwards Lifesciences are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or "FDA," and numerous other federal,
state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be
costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result
in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have material adverse effects on Edwards Lifesciences' business or results of operations. In addition, there
can be no assurance that Edwards Lifesciences will be or will continue to be in compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements. If the FDA or some other foreign governmental
authority were to conclude that Edwards Lifesciences was not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the FDA or such other foreign governmental authority, as applicable, could institute
proceedings to detain or seize Edwards Lifesciences' products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against Edwards Lifesciences, its
officers or its employees and could recommend criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice. Moreover, the FDA or some other foreign governmental authority could proceed to ban, or request recall,
repair, replacement or refund of the cost of, any device or product manufactured or distributed by Edwards Lifesciences. Furthermore, both the FDA and foreign government regulators have become
increasingly stringent, and Edwards Lifesciences may be subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future.

Edwards Lifesciences is subject to risks arising from concerns and/or regulatory actions relating to "mad cow disease."

Certain of Edwards Lifesciences' products, including pericardial tissue valve products, are manufactured using bovine tissue. Concerns relating to the potential
transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or "BSE," commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of bovine products. Edwards Lifesciences obtains
its bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the United States. In December 2003, one case of a cow infected with BSE was reported in the United States. In response to this
situation, in late December 2003, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced new strengthened control and surveillance measures with respect to BSE. To date, there have been no additional
reported cases in the United States. The bovine tissue used in Edwards Lifesciences' pericardial tissue valve products is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to
have shown no risk of infectibility. Edwards Lifesciences has not experienced any significant adverse impact on its sales as a result of concerns regarding BSE, but no assurance can be given that such
an impact may not occur in the future.

If third-party payors decline to reimburse Edwards Lifesciences' customers for its products or reduce reimbursement levels, Edwards Lifesciences' ability to profitably sell its
products will be harmed.

Edwards Lifesciences sells its products and technologies to hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health
care services provided to its patients from


third-party
payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine
that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third-party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication.
Third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. Edwards Lifesciences believes that many of its existing and future products are cost-effective
because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time. Edwards Lifesciences cannot be certain whether these third-party payors will recognize these cost savings or
will merely focus on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies. If Edwards Lifesciences' products are not considered cost-effective by third-party payors, Edwards
Lifesciences' customers may not be reimbursed for its products.

In
addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. There
can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement, if any, will not be decreased in the future, or that future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not otherwise
adversely affect the demand for and price levels of Edwards Lifesciences' products. In Japan, customers are reimbursed for Edwards Lifesciences' products under a government-operated insurance system.
Under this system, the Japanese government annually reviews the reimbursement levels for products. The Japanese government is also considering other reimbursement regulation. If the Japanese
government decides to reduce reimbursement levels for Edwards Lifesciences products, its product pricing may be adversely affected.

Edwards Lifesciences is, or may be, subject to lawsuits related to products or services manufactured or performed by the Company.

Edwards Lifesciences is, or may be, a party to, or may be otherwise responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits or other claims related to products and
services currently or formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by the Company or other matters. Such cases and claims may raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and may be
subject to many uncertainties and complexities, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and
differences in applicable law. Upon resolution of any
pending legal matters or other claims, Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges in excess of presently established reserves. While such a charge could have a material adverse impact on Edwards
Lifesciences' net income or net cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid, management believes that no such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material
adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' consolidated financial position.

The market price for Edwards Lifesciences' common stock may be volatile.

The market price of Edwards Lifesciences' common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and
below as well as a number of factors, including the following:

•

quarterly
variations in operating results, as discussed above under "—Fluctuations in Edwards Lifesciences' quarterly operating results may cause its stock price
to decline,"

•

announcements
of innovations, new products, strategic developments or business combinations by Edwards Lifesciences or its competitors,

•

changes
in Edwards Lifesciences expected operating expense levels or income and losses,

•

changes
in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts,

•

the
operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to Edwards Lifesciences, and


•

changes
in general conditions in the economy, the financial markets, the domestic or international political situation or the medical device industry.

In
addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities
issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect Edwards Lifesciences' stock price, regardless of its
operating results.

Edwards Lifesciences' stockholder rights plan, charter and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire the Company.

Edwards Lifesciences has a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals. The rights issued under the
stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire Edwards Lifesciences on terms not approved in advance by its board of directors. In addition,
Delaware corporate law and Edwards Lifesciences' charter and bylaws contain provisions that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or its management. These provisions could
also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for Edwards Lifesciences' stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions without the concurrence of its management or board
of directors. These provisions:

•

authorize
Edwards Lifesciences' board of directors to issue "blank check" preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by its board of directors,
without stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of common stock;

•

provide
for a staggered board of directors and three-year terms for directors, so that no more than one-third of Edwards Lifesciences' directors
could be replaced at any annual meeting;

•

provide
that directors may be removed only for cause;

•

provide
that stockholder action may be taken only at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent;

•

provide
for super-majority voting requirements for some provisions of Edwards Lifesciences' charter; and

•

establish
advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a
meeting.

Edwards
Lifesciences is also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could also delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions of
Edwards Lifesciences' charter and bylaws, Delaware law and its stockholder rights plan may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market
prices of Edwards Lifesciences' common stock, and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of its common stock.

Edwards Lifesciences' issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of its common stock and discourage a takeover.

Edwards Lifesciences' board of directors is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of its stockholders.
Edwards Lifesciences' board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend
rights, preferences over its common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that Edwards Lifesciences issues preferred
stock in the future that has preference over its common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon its liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if Edwards Lifesciences issues preferred stock
with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock, the rights of the holders of its common stock or the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the
ability of Edwards Lifesciences' board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of its stockholders may impede a takeover of Edwards Lifesciences and prevent a
transaction favorable to the holders of its common stock.

Item 3    Legal Proceedings

On June 29, 2000, Edwards Lifesciences filed a lawsuit against St. Jude Medical, Inc. alleging infringement of three Edwards Lifesciences United
States patents. This lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. St. Jude has answered and asserted
various affirmative defenses and counterclaims with respect to the lawsuit. On April 9, 2002, a fourth Edwards Lifesciences United States patent was added to the lawsuit. Discovery is
proceeding.

On
August 18, 2003, Edwards Lifesciences filed a lawsuit against Medtronic, Inc., Medtronic AVE, Cook, Inc. and W.L. Gore & Associates alleging infringement
of a patent exclusively licensed to the Company. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. Each
of the defendants has answered and asserted various affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Discovery is proceeding.

In
addition, Edwards Lifesciences is, or may be, a party to, or may be otherwise responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or
formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by Edwards Lifesciences. Such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and
complexities, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. Upon
resolution of any


pending
legal matters, Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges in excess of presently established reserves. While such a charge could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' net income
or net cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid, management believes that no such charge would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' consolidated financial position.

Edwards
Lifesciences is also subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the United States. The operations of Edwards Lifesciences, like those of
other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While it is difficult to quantify the
potential impact of compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Item 7    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of Edwards Lifesciences during the three years
ended December 31, 2003. Also discussed is Edwards Lifesciences' financial position as of December 31, 2003. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical
consolidated condensed financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Overview

Edwards Lifesciences is a global provider of products and technologies that are designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. Edwards Lifesciences focuses on
providing products and technologies


to
address four main cardiovascular disease states: heart valve disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. The products and services provided by
Edwards Lifesciences to treat cardiovascular disease are categorized into five main areas: Cardiac Surgery, Critical Care, Vascular, Perfusion and Other Distributed Products.

Edwards
Lifesciences'

cardiac surgery

portfolio is comprised primarily of products relating to heart valve therapy, cannula products used
during open-heart surgery and transmyocardial revascularization ("TMR"). Edwards Lifesciences is the world's leader in, and has been a pioneer in, the development and commercialization of
tissue valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve. In the

critical care

area, Edwards
Lifesciences is a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient's heart function, and also provides central venous access products for fluid and drug delivery. Edwards
Lifesciences'

vascular

portfolio includes a line of balloon catheter-based products, surgical clips and inserts, angioscopy equipment, stents and
artificial implanteable grafts. In the

perfusion

category, Edwards Lifesciences develops, manufactures and markets, in regions outside the United States
and Western Europe, a diverse line of disposable products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, including oxygenators, blood containers, filters and related devices. Lastly,

other distributed products

include sales of intra-aortic balloon pumps, pacemakers, angioplasty systems and other products sold through the Company's
distribution network in Japan, and miscellaneous pharmaceutical products sold in the United States.

In
order to provide greater visibility to a key part of its business, beginning in January 2004, the Company will recategorize its products into Heart Valve Therapy, Cardiac
Surgery Systems, Critical Care, Vascular and Other Distributed Products. Heart Valve Therapy will include all heart valve repair and replacement products, and Cardiac Surgery Systems will include
cannula products used during open-heart surgery, TMR products, and all products currently in the perfusion category. The other categories will remain the same.

The
health care marketplace continues to be competitive. There has been consolidation in Edwards Lifesciences' customer base and among its competitors, which has resulted in pricing and
market share pressures. Edwards Lifesciences has experienced increases in its labor and material costs, which are primarily influenced by general inflationary trends. Management expects these trends
to continue.

Joint Venture in Japan

Subsequent to the distribution of the Company's common stock to stockholders of Baxter International Inc. ("Baxter") on March 31, 2000 the
cardiovascular business in Japan was being operated pursuant to a joint venture under which a Japanese subsidiary of Baxter retained ownership of the Japanese business assets, but a subsidiary of
Edwards Lifesciences held a 90% profit interest. From April 1, 2000 to September 30, 2002, Edwards Lifesciences (a) recognized its shipments into the joint venture as sales at
distributor price at the time the joint venture sold to the end customer, and (b) utilized the equity method of accounting to record its 90% profit interest in the operations of the joint
venture in Other Operating Income.

On
October 1, 2002, the Company acquired from Baxter for $19.0 million, net, the cardiovascular business in Japan. The purchase price excluded approximately
$30.0 million of securitized accounts receivable. In the three months ended September 30, 2002, the Company recorded a $3.3 million charge for legal, administrative and regulatory
expenses related to the acquisition. Commencing October 1, 2002, the Company began reporting the results of the Japan business on a fully consolidated basis. The acquisition did not materially
impact the Company's net income as the terms of the joint venture agreement enabled Edwards Lifesciences to record substantially all of the net profit generated by the Japan business.

The
decrease in the United States' net sales in 2002 was due primarily to the sale of the Company's U.S. perfusion services business in June 2001, which decreased United States
net sales by 14.5 percentage points. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of cardiac surgery products.

The
increase in international net sales in 2003 was due primarily to the following:

•

the
change in accounting for sales in Japan (see "Joint Venture in Japan") increased international net sales by 29.0 percentage points;

•

the
impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased international net sales by 12.4 percentage points (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and
Japanese yen against the United States dollar); and

•

increased
sales of cardiac surgery and vascular products (see below).

The
increase in international net sales for 2002 was due primarily to the following:

•

the
change in accounting for sales in Japan increased international net sales by 10.4 percentage points; and

•

increased
sales of cardiac surgery products (see below).

The
impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales would not necessarily be indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs, and Edwards Lifesciences' hedging activities. For more information see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About
Market Risk."

Cardiac Surgery

The net sales growth of cardiac surgery products in 2003 resulted primarily from the following:

•

currency
exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales by 5.5 percentage points (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States
dollar);

•

the
change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 2.8 percentage points;

•

pericardial
tissue valves increased net sales by 4.8 percentage points; and

•

heart
valve repair products increased net sales by 1.7 percentage points.

The
net sales growth of cardiac surgery products in 2002 resulted primarily from the following:

•

pericardial
tissue valves increased net sales by 7.9 percentage points;

•

heart
valve repair products increased net sales by 1.9 percentage points; and

•

the
change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 1.1 percentage points.

Management
expects that its heart valve therapy products will continue to serve as a key driver of Edwards Lifesciences' sales growth. Beginning in January 2004, the heart valve
therapy products will be in a separate product category called Heart Valve Therapy and the remaining cardiac surgery products will be included in Cardiac Surgery Systems.

Critical Care

The net sales growth of critical care products in 2003 resulted primarily from the following:

•

the
change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 10.0 percentage points;

•

currency
exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales by 6.9 percentage points (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States
dollar); and

•

strong
sales in global pressure monitoring products and overall strong performance in emerging global markets.

The
net sales growth of critical care products in 2002 resulted primarily from the following:

•

the
change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 4.2 percentage points;

•

increased
sales of access, hemofiltration and advanced catheter products; and

•

the
net sales growth was partially offset by the decline in base hemodynamic catheters sales, which decreased net sales by 1.4 percentage points.

Critical
care products have been, and are expected to be, significant contributors to the Company's total sales.

Vascular

The net sales growth of vascular products for 2003 resulted primarily from the following:

•

currency
exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales by 7.0 percentage points (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and the Japanese yen against the United
States dollar);

•

the
change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 4.0 percentage points;

•

Lifepath
AAA sales increased net sales by 2.4 percentage points, primarily in Europe; and

•

net
sales growth was partially offset by continued declines in base vascular products.


The
net sales growth of vascular products for 2002 resulted primarily from the following:

•

initial
sales of Lifepath AAA increased net sales by 5.1 percentage points;

•

the
change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 1.6 percentage points; and

•

net
sales growth was partially offset by continued declines in base vascular products.

In
December 2003, the Company announced its intent to explore strategic alternatives for the Lifepath AAA program. Lifepath AAA sales in 2003 were $4.7 million.

Perfusion

The net sales growth of perfusion for 2003 resulted primarily from the following:

•

the
change in accounting for sales in Japan increased net sales by 33.4 percentage points;

•

currency
exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales by 5.3 percentage points (primarily the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States
dollar);

•

the
net sales growth was partially offset by the sale of the Company's German perfusion services subsidiary in July 2003, which decreased net sales by
4.7 percentage points; and

•

the
reduction of low-margin distributed product sales in North America, which decreased net sales by 6.5 percentage points.

The
net sales decrease of perfusion for 2002 resulted primarily from the following:

•

the
sale of the Company's U.S. perfusion services business in June 2001 decreased net sales by 59.8 percentage points;

•

currency
exchange rate fluctuations decreased net sales by 2.6 percentage points (primarily the weakening of the Brazilian real against the United States dollar,
offset by the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar);

•

the
ongoing reduction of sales in Western Europe and the United States; and

•

the
net sales decrease was partially offset by the change in accounting for sales in Japan, which increased global net sales by 5.3 percentage points.

Beginning
in January 2004, the Perfusion category will no longer be separately reported and all perfusion products and services will be included in Cardiac Surgery Systems.

Other Distributed Products

Other distributed products include sales of intra-aortic balloon pumps, pacemakers, angioplasty systems and other products sold through the Company's distribution
network in Japan, and miscellaneous pharmaceutical products sold in the United States. The net sales for 2003 and 2002 increased primarily due to the impact of the change in accounting for sales in
Japan.

Loss on Sale of Stock

Effective June 30, 2001, the Company sold the stock of Edwards Lifesciences Cardiovascular Resources, Inc. ("ELCR") to Fresenius Medical Care AG for
cash proceeds of $45.0 million (the "ELCR Sale"), resulting in a pre-tax loss of $68.2 million (including the write-off of $83.0 million of goodwill). ELCR
provided and managed perfusionists, monitoring systems, capital equipment and disposable material on a contract service basis to hospitals in the United States and Puerto Rico.

The

Asset Impairments


In September 2002, the Company recorded a $67.4 million charge related to the impairment of its investment in preferred stock of World Heart
Corporation ("WorldHeart"). The investment was written down to $6.2 million, which represented the value of the Company's preferred stock investment had it been converted into common stock at
October 15, 2002 (the closing date of September's books). The decision to record the charge was based primarily on WorldHeart's September 2002 decision to refocus its product development
efforts by adopting a new design concept for a next generation product that resulted in a significant delay (approximately two years) in its product development timeline (with a revised commercial
launch date of 2007) and impaired WorldHeart's competitive position. Accordingly, the Company concluded that sufficient risk existed that WorldHeart may be unable to fully liquidate the Company's
investment in WorldHeart's preferred stock. The Company believed that the best objective indicator of the then fair value of its investment in WorldHeart's preferred stock was the market price of
WorldHeart's common stock based upon the Company's expectation that the value of its preferred stock investment would be realized through the common stock, as opposed to redemption of the preferred
stock.


Based upon the non-strategic nature and declining profitability of certain products in the Company's portfolio (including certain distributed
products), the Company decided during the quarter ended June 30, 2001 to discontinue its sales effort of these products. The long-lived assets and the investments related to these
products were evaluated to determine whether any impairment in their recoverability existed at the determination date. As a result, Edwards Lifesciences assessed whether the estimated cash flows of
the products or investments over the estimated lives of the related assets were


sufficient
to recover their costs. Where such cash flows were insufficient, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of assets or investments and recorded an
impairment charge to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair values. As a result of this evaluation, Edwards Lifesciences recorded a $14.8 million charge primarily related to the
impairment of intangibles ($8.3 million), the impairment of an investment ($5.5 million) and the write-down of non-productive assets ($1.0 million).

Goodwill Amortization

The elimination of goodwill amortization commencing in the year 2002 resulted from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 142, "

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

" (see "Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements"). Effective January 1, 2002, the
accounting for goodwill changed from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach.

Special Charges


Purchased in-process Research and Development Expenses ($13.6 million)

On February 18, 2003, the Company acquired the endovascular mitral valve repair program of Jomed N.V., a European-based provider of products for minimally
invasive vascular intervention, for $20.0 million in cash. The acquisition included all technology and intellectual property associated with the program. At the acquisition date, the program,
which was less than 50% complete, was involved in testing proprietary prototypes prior to initiating required animal studies and human clinicals. Additional design improvements, bench testing, animal
studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling the product in Europe (expected in 2005) and in the United States (expected in 2006). The risks and uncertainties
associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time include those related to the design, development and manufacturability of the product, the success of animal and clinical
studies and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. The fair market value of the assets acquired consisted primarily of patents that are being amortized over their estimated
economic life of 17 years. Approximately $11.8 million of the purchase price has been charged to in-process research and development. The value of the in-process
research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 30%. The valuation assumed approximately
$20.0 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. In the valuation, material net cash inflows were forecasted to
commence in 2008. As of December 31, 2003, the program remains reasonably on track with the Company's original expectations.

On
December 5, 2003, the Company acquired the stock of Whitland Research Limited ("Whitland") for $3.2 million in cash, although achievement of future milestones through
2006 could increase the total price to $5.6 million. Whitland was focused on the development of critical care monitoring technologies. The $3.2 million purchase price was allocated to
acquired in-process research and development ($1.8 million) and patents ($1.4 million) based upon their estimated fair values. The patents will be amortized over their
estimated useful life of 10 years.

Severance Charge ($13.0 million)

In July 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $13.0 million associated with a decision to streamline operations. The charge was primarily related
to the severance costs associated with reducing the Company's worldwide workforce by 136 employees, primarily in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2003, $4.1 million of
the charge remained unpaid.


Baxter Arbitration Settlement ($5.3 million)

In January 2004, the Company concluded a dispute resolution proceeding with Baxter. Each company sought reimbursement from the other for a variety of
claims arising from the Company's spin-off from Baxter in April 2000. The resolution resulted in a $5.3 million charge primarily related to the valuation of receivables at
the date of spin-off, and a $5.4 million increase to Additional Contributed Capital related to the true-up of the beginning balance of equity.

Loss on Sale of Business ($3.3 million)

Effective July 4, 2003, the Company sold its German perfusion services subsidiary to WKK GmbH, a German-based provider of hospital services, for a nominal
amount. Sales generated by the German perfusion services subsidiary were approximately $3.5 million, during the six months ended June 30, 2003 and $6.6 million for the year 2002.
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

," and Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 100, "

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

," the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.3 million in 2003 to reduce the carrying
value of the subsidiary's assets to fair value based upon the proceeds from the sale.

Pension Curtailment ($1.9 million)

On November 4, 2003, the Company suspended its defined benefit pension plan in Puerto Rico ("the Plan"). Effective December 31, 2003, employees do
not earn additional defined benefits for future services. To mitigate the Puerto Rico employees' reduced benefits from the Plan's suspension, effective January 1, 2004, the Company increased
its contributions to the Puerto Rico 1165(e) defined contribution plan. In accordance with SFAS No. 88, "

Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits

," the Company recorded a curtailment loss of $1.9 million during the fourth quarter 2003. As of
December 31, 2003, the Plan's accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of its assets by $2.4 million.


The Company recorded a $3.3 million charge for legal, administrative and regulatory expenses related to the October 2002 acquisition of the
cardiovascular business in Japan (see "Joint Venture in Japan").

Equity Earnings in Japan Operations

Equity earnings in Japan operations was $11.0 million and $16.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Equity earnings in Japan operations
represent the Company's 90% profit interest in the cardiovascular business in Japan effective from April 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. The decrease in 2002 results primarily from
the consolidation of the Japan business effective October 1, 2002. For more information, see "Joint Venture in Japan."

Interest Expense, net

Interest expense, net was $13.2 million, $11.5 million and $22.9 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The increase in interest
expense, net for 2003 resulted primarily from the higher interest rate associated with the Company's fixed rate debt. The decrease in interest expense, net for 2002 resulted primarily from
(a) the Company's reduction of debt, (b) lower interest rates on its floating rate debt, and (c) a $6.2 million charge in 2001 related to a payment to unwind an interest
rate swap agreement that had locked in a fixed interest rate on $75.0 million of floating rate debt. The decision to
unwind the interest rate swap agreement resulted from the Company's pay-down of underlying floating rate debt not anticipated to be necessary in funding future requirements of working
capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments.

Excluding
the impact of special charges, the effective income tax rate was 26.0% for both 2003 and 2002, and 28.0% for 2001. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2002 was due
primarily to the elimination of non-deductible goodwill amortization upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. For more information see "Effects of Recent
Accounting Pronouncements." The Company expects its effective income tax rate for recurring operations will increase to 27% for 2004 due in part to the expiration of the research credit.

During
2003, the Company commenced a legal reorganization of its Brazil subsidiary to improve its balance sheet and to enhance its ability to conduct business in Brazil. Since being
acquired a number of years ago, this subsidiary has incurred net operating losses primarily due to the devaluation of the local


currency
and interest expense incurred on inter-company debt. In addition, the reorganization allowed the Company to recognize the accumulated losses and inter-company debt write-off under
United States tax law, resulting in federal and state tax benefits of $13.7 million.

During
2003, the Company recapitalized its Japan subsidiary. As a result, a deemed dividend occurred for U.S. tax purposes resulting in an incremental tax provision of
$6.2 million, net of foreign tax credits. The recapitalization was a one-time event and all of the future earnings of the Company's Japan subsidiary are intended to be permanently
reinvested.

In
exchange for the sale of the Novacor mechanical cardiac assist product line to WorldHeart in June 2000, the Company received WorldHeart preferred stock. In 2002, the investment
in the WorldHeart preferred stock was deemed to be impaired and written down to its fair market value. Due to the uncertainty of using any potential tax benefit for the loss, a valuation allowance of
$13.8 million has been established.

As
a result of tax law developments in 2002, the Company recorded a $20.1 million tax benefit during 2002 related to the loss on sale of its United States perfusion services
business in June 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's sources of cash liquidity include cash on hand and cash equivalents, amounts available under credit facilities, proceeds from a convertible debt
offering, accounts receivable securitization facilities and cash from operations. The Company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital
expenditures and other financial commitments. The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long-term capital to fund short-term and
long-term growth objectives. However, no assurances can be given that such long-term capital will be available to Edwards Lifesciences on favorable terms, or at all.

As
of December 31, 2003, the Company had two unsecured revolving credit agreements providing for up to an aggregate of $530.0 million in one- to
six- month borrowings in multiple currencies. Borrowings currently bear interest at the London interbank offering rate (LIBOR)
plus 0.75%, which includes a facility fee. One of the credit agreements provides for long-term borrowings up to an aggregate of $430.0 million and expires on March 30, 2005
(the "Five Year Credit Facility"). The other credit agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of $100.0 million through March 25, 2004 (the "364 Day Facility"). As the 364 Day
Facility has not been used recently, the Company does not plan to renew this credit agreement when it expires.

As
of December 31, 2003, borrowings of $105.8 million were outstanding under the Five Year Credit Facility and no borrowings were outstanding under the 364 Day Facility.
Edwards Lifesciences pays a facility fee, regardless of available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.15% for the Five Year Credit Facility and 0.125% for the 364 Day Facility.
As of December 31, 2003, all amounts outstanding under the Five Year Credit Facility have been classified as long-term obligations, as these borrowings will continue to be
refinanced pursuant to that credit agreement. In March 2004, the Company will reclassify any balance outstanding on the Five Year Credit Facility to short-term as the agreement will
expire within one year. The credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2003.

In
May 2003, the Company issued $150.0 million of convertible senior debentures, issued at par, bearing an interest rate of 3.875% per annum due May 15, 2033 (the
"Notes"). Interest is payable semi-annually in May and November. Issuance costs of approximately $3.6 million are being amortized to interest expense over 5 years. The Notes
are convertible into 18.29 shares of the Company's common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes (conversion price of $54.66 per share), subject to


adjustment.
The Notes may be converted, at the option of the holders, on or prior to the final maturity date under any of the following circumstances:

•

during
any fiscal quarter, if the closing sale price per share of the Company's common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price;

•

if
the Notes have been called for redemption; or

•

upon
the occurrence of specified corporate events.

Holders
of the Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and
unpaid interest on May 15, 2008, 2013, and 2018. The Company will pay cash for all Notes so purchased on May 15, 2008. For any Notes purchased by the Company on May 15, 2013 or
2018, the Company may, at its option, choose to pay the purchase price in cash, in shares of the Company's common stock, or any combination thereof. The Company must pay all accrued and unpaid
interest in cash.

The
Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at any time on or after May 15, 2008, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be
redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Beginning
with the six-month interest period commencing May 15, 2008, holders of the Notes will receive contingent interest at a rate of 0.25% if the trading price of
the Notes equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amounts of the Notes. This contingent interest payment feature represents an embedded derivative. Based on the immaterial value associated with this
feature, no value has been assigned to the derivative at issuance or at December 31, 2003.

As
further discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has two securitization programs whereby certain subsidiaries in the United States and Japan
sell, without recourse, on a continuous basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of accounts receivable. The significant benefits of the securitizations are lower cost of funds and
differentiated sources of liquidity. The Company has been able to effectively lower its overall cost of funds as a result of the interest rate spreads it pays on these advances as opposed to
borrowings under the current LIBOR based credit facility. Additionally, the Company believes that in diversifying its funding sources, the Company's funding availability in the capital markets is
strengthened. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had sold a total of $91.2 million of trade accounts receivable and received funding of $76.9 million. These proceeds are
generally used to reduce revolving lines of credit. The securitization program in the United States is renewable for one-year periods at the Company's option and will expire on
December 21, 2004. The securitization program in Japan will expire on December 3, 2005.

In
November 2001, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated
transactions up to 2.0 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. This program was completed in 2003. In addition, on May 6, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors
approved a second stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase an additional 2.0 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock through December 31, 2005. Stock
repurchased under these programs will primarily be used to offset obligations under the Company's employee stock option programs. During 2003, the Company repurchased 1,766,300 shares at an aggregate
cost of $49.4 million under the second stock repurchase program.

Cash

earnings in 2003 before non-cash charges and credits;

•

decreased
net cash outflows from accounts and other receivables;

•

decreased
net cash outflows from accounts payable and accrued expenses;


•

net cash inflows from reductions in inventory;

•

partially
offset by increased net cash outflows from accounts and other receivables (primarily the 2002 securitization of Japan receivables); and

•

increased
net cash outflows from accounts payables and accrued expenses.

Cash
used in

investing activities

in 2003 decreased $5.0 million from 2002 due primarily to the following:

•

acquisition
of joint venture in Japan of $19.0 million in 2002;

•

decreased
spending in 2003 on capital expenditures and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries;

•

receipt
of payment on a note receivable in 2003;

•

partially
offset by the 2003 purchase of Jomed's intellectual property (see "Purchased in-process Research and Development Expenses") and the 2003 purchase of
the technology and intellectual property associated with Embol-X Inc.'s surgically placed, intra-aortic embolic management system.

The
total consideration for Embol-X Inc. was $13.6 million, comprised of $8.0 million cash, a deferred payment of $2.0 million cash payable upon
the completion of the technology transfer (which was completed during August 2003), stock in an unconsolidated affiliated company valued at $3.0 million and $0.6 million of
capitalized transaction costs. In accordance with the guidance provided in Emerging Issues Task Force 98-3, "

Determining Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves
Receipt of Productive Assets or of a Business

," the transaction was accounted for as a purchased business combination. The purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets
at their estimated fair value as follows (in millions):

December 31, 2003. Forecasted sales of medical devices from the transferred technology are expected to be less than $2.0 million for 2004.

Cash
used in

investing activities

in 2002 increased $64.4 million from 2001 due primarily to the cash provided by the sale of the
U.S. perfusion services business in 2001, partially offset by the cash used in the acquisition of the Company's joint venture in Japan in 2002.

Cash
used in

financing activities

in 2003 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $49.4 million and net payments on
debt of $4.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of


$36.6 million
and proceeds from securitization programs of $6.2 million. Cash used in

financing activities

in 2002 consisted primarily of
net payments on debt of $82.1 million and purchases of treasury stock of $30.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from securitization programs of $29.9 million and proceeds
from stock plans of $13.7 million.

On
January 27, 2004, the Company acquired Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc. ("PVT") for $125.0 million in cash, plus up to an additional $30.0 million
upon the achievement of key milestones through 2007. The acquisition was financed through the Company's Five Year Credit Facility and operations. The Company expects to take an initial
in-process research and development charge related to this transaction in the first quarter of 2004, estimated between $60.0 million and $90.0 million. The remainder of the
purchase price will be allocated to patents involving PVT's proprietary technology. PVT, located in Fort Lee, NJ, with a subsidiary in Israel, is a leader in the development of an innovative,
catheter-based (percutaneous) approach for replacing aortic heart valves. PVT's technology is a combination balloon-expandable stent technology integrated with a percutaneously delivered tissue heart
valve. Unlike conventional open-heart valve replacement surgery, this less-invasive procedure is designed to be performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory under local
anesthesia.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company's results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the Company's accounting policies, as discussed in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Company's accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the
United States ("GAAP"). In evaluating the Company's transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
Management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies. Management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different
amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.

The
application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and
reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, workers' compensation liabilities, employee benefit
related liabilities, deferred


tax
asset valuation allowances, any impairments of assets, anticipated transactions to be hedged, litigation reserves and contingencies.

These
matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses
its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. The Company also uses outside
experts where appropriate. The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.

The
Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Company's reported results and require subjective or complex
judgments by management.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue for sales when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists, product delivery and acceptance has occurred or
services have been rendered, and collection is reasonably assured. In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the
time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory. The Company enters into certain arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements to its customers. Revenue related
to an individual element is deferred unless delivery of the element represents a separate earnings process. Total revenue for these arrangements is allocated among the elements based on the fair value
of the individual elements, with the relative fair values determined based on objective evidence (generally based on sales of the individual element to other third parties). Management is required to
make judgments about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured.

The
Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force 01-9 as of January 1, 2002 and presents the cost of certain vendor considerations as reductions of revenue. Adoption of
this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns
and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. These adjustments include
estimates for charge backs, rebates, returns, and other sales allowances. These provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated
customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with wholesale and indirect customers. If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions does not properly
reflect future activity, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted. The Company's estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on
third-party data, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and
economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has
anticipated or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.1 million and $5.5 million at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

Excess and Obsolete Inventory

The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Additional inventory
allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated. Inventory reserves result from inventory, which is obsolete, is nearing its
expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), or is damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply). The allowance for excess and obsolete
inventory was $8.5 million and $9.6 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


Patent Costs

The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications. The Company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of
issued patents for which success is deemed probable. The related costs are amortized over the remaining useful lives of the patents using the straight-line method. Such deferred costs are
periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability. To the extent the Company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement, costs
capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

,"
whereby goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review. As the Company's operations are comprised of one reporting unit, the Company reviews the recoverability
of its goodwill by comparing the Company's fair value to the net book value of its assets. If the book value of the Company's assets exceeds the Company's fair value, the goodwill is written down to
its implied fair value.

Additionally,
management reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangibles whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be
recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments. If
it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization
periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value. Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved. For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash
flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are designated as available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115,
"

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

." These investments are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses
reported in stockholders' equity as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method. The fair values of certain investments
are based on quoted market prices. For other investments, various methods are used to estimate fair value, including external valuations and discounted cash flows. When the fair value of a certain
investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss:

•

the
duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost;

•

the
financial condition and near term prospects of the investee;

•

the
reasons for the decline in market value;

•

the
investee's performance against product development milestones; and

•

the
Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.


Income Taxes

The Company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure. New laws and new interpretations of laws and
rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments. Due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues, actual payments or assessments may differ from
estimates. To the extent the Company's estimates differ from actual payments or assessments, income tax expense is adjusted. Additional information regarding income taxes is included in Note 16
of the consolidated financial statements.

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "

Accounting for Income Taxes

." Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. At December 31,
2003, the Company had deferred tax assets of $107.9 million, partially offset by deferred tax liabilities of $17.2 million. The valuation allowance of $19.5 million as of
December 31, 2003 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for
certain investments and the net operating loss carryforwards of certain non-United States subsidiaries. The Company evaluates annually the realizability of its deferred tax assets by
assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Company's forecast of future taxable
income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could
affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.

Employee Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans

The Company applies the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

," in accounting for its fixed stock option and employee stock purchase plans. In accordance with this intrinsic value method, no compensation expense is recognized
for these plans. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2001, Edwards Lifesciences adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 140, "

Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

." This statement replaces SFAS No. 125 and revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and
other transfers of financial assets and collateral. SFAS No. 140 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31,
2001. This statement was effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2000. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

." SFAS No. 142, which changes the
accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. No transition adjustment was
recorded upon adoption of this standard on January 1, 2002. However, adoption of this standard resulted in the elimination of goodwill amortization commencing January 1, 2002. See
Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.

In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

Item 7A    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

The Company's business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including currency exchange rates and interest rates. The
Company's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs.

Edwards
Lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps, option-based products and forward currency contracts. The Company does not use
any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The total notional amounts of the Company's derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were
$569.6 million and $588.2 million, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements, option-based products, and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts
exchanged by the parties and, are not a measure of the Company's exposure through its use of derivatives.


Interest Rate Risk

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swap agreements are executed as an
integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis. The Company's interest rate swap agreements involve agreements to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate, at specified
intervals, calculated on an agreed-upon notional amount.

As
part of its overall risk-management program the Company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to
hypothetical movements in interest rates. A 46 basis-point increase in interest rates (approximately 10 percent of the Company's weighted average interest rate) affecting the Company's
financial instruments, including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments, would not change the Company's annual interest expense, net because the Company has no floating rate debt,
after giving effect to interest rate
swaps. In January 2004, the Company borrowed $105.0 million on its floating rate Five Year Credit Facility to fund its general operating activities and the acquisition of PVT.

Currency Risk

The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange-rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in Japanese yen and the
Euro. Business activities in various currencies expose the Company to the risk that the eventual net United States dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers
denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts. The Company
also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated, but not yet committed, sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company hedges certain of its net
investments in international affiliates. Such contracts hedge the United States dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by
creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets. Any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange
rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

As
part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs, the Company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option-based products in managing its
exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Option-based products consist primarily of purchased put options in conjunction with written (sold) call options to create collars. Option-based products are
agreements that either grant the Company the right to receive, or require the Company to make payments at, specified currency rate levels.

As
part of its risk-management process, the Company uses a value-at-risk ("VAR") methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and
manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation,
with a 95 percent confidence level, using spot and three-month implied volatilities as stochastic variables and correlations (as of the measurement date) to estimate this potential loss. The
Company's calculated VAR at December 31, 2003 and 2002, with a maturity of up to one year, is $3.0 million and $4.3 million, respectively. This amount excludes the potential
effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances. The Company's calculated VAR exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized
on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur. It does not represent the maximum
possible loss or any expected loss that may occur. Actual future gains or losses may differ from (and could be significantly greater than) these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market
rates, operating exposures and the timing thereof, and changes in the Company's


portfolio
of derivatives during the measured periods. In addition, the assumption within the VAR model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse, which may not be the case. Any loss
incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures; there may be currency exchange-rate gains or losses in
the future.

Credit Risk

Derivative financial instruments used by the Company involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in the event a counter-party should default and market
risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations. Credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines, counter-party diversification, monitoring of counter-party
financial condition and master-netting agreements in place with all derivative counter-parties. Credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of
contracts with a positive fair value at December 31, 2003 reduced by the effects of master netting agreements. Additionally, at December 31, 2003, all derivative financial instruments,
based on notional amounts, were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of "AA" or better by national rating agencies. The Company does not anticipate
non-performance by its counter-parties and has no reserves related to non-performance as of December 31, 2003; the Company has not experienced any counterparty default
during the three years ended December 31, 2003.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the health care industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers
and maintains reserves for potential credit losses which, when realized, have been within the range of management's allowance for doubtful accounts during all periods presented.

Sales
to Baxter, acting in the capacity of the Company's distributor subsequent to the Distribution, represented approximately 8% and 11% of the Company's total net sales for 2002 and
2001, respectively. Substantially all of these agreements had been terminated as of December 31, 2002. In 2003, the Company had no customers that represent greater than 10% of its total net
sales or accounts receivable, net.

Investment Risk

Edwards Lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments. The Company invests in equity instruments of public
and private companies. These investments are classified in "Investments in unconsolidated affiliates" on the consolidated balance sheets.

In
2002, the Company recorded a $67.4 million pretax charge related to the impairment of its investment in preferred stock of WorldHeart. The investment was written down to
$6.2 million, which represented the value of the Company's preferred stock investment had it been converted into common stock at October 15, 2002. The decision to record the charge was
based primarily on delays in WorldHeart's product development timelines, arising from its revised strategy. Should WorldHeart fail to meet certain future development and financing milestones, further
impairment charges may be necessary.

In
addition to the investment in WorldHeart ($11.6 million at December 31, 2003), Edwards Lifesciences had approximately $23.8 million of investments in equity
instruments of other companies. At December 31, 2003, the Company had recorded unrealized gains of $4.3 million and unrealized losses of $4.8 million on these investments in
"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income," net of tax. Management considers these declines temporary in nature based upon the individual companies' operating results, financial condition and
achievement of product development milestones. Should these


companies
experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments' values may be considered other than temporary and impairment
charges may be necessary.

Item 8    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Management

The management of Edwards Lifesciences is responsible for the integrity of the financial information presented in this Form 10-K. The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Where necessary, they reflect estimates based on management's judgment.

Management
relies upon established accounting procedures and related systems of internal control for meeting its responsibilities to maintain reliable financial records. These systems
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's intentions. Internal auditors
periodically review the accounting and control systems, and these systems are revised if and when weaknesses or deficiencies are found.

The
Audit and Public Policy Committee of the Board of Directors, composed of directors from outside the Company, meets regularly with management, the Company's internal auditors and its
independent auditors to discuss audit scope and results, internal control evaluations, and other accounting, reporting and financial matters. The independent auditors and internal auditors have access
to the Audit and Public Policy Committee without management's presence.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Edwards Lifesciences Corporation is a global provider of products and technologies that are designed to treat advanced cardiovascular disease. Edwards
Lifesciences' sales are categorized in five main product areas: cardiac surgery, critical care, vascular, perfusion and other distributed products. Edwards Lifesciences focuses on four main
cardiovascular disease states: heart valve disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and congestive heart failure.

Edwards
Lifesciences Corporation was incorporated under the original name of CVG Controlled Inc. in Delaware on September 10, 1999, as a subsidiary of Baxter
International Inc. ("Baxter"). On March 31, 2000 (the "Distribution Date"), Baxter transferred its cardiovascular business (the "Edwards Lifesciences Business") to Edwards Lifesciences
in connection with a tax-free spin-off by Baxter of the Edwards Lifesciences Business. The spin-off was effected on the Distribution Date through a distribution of
58.1 million shares of Edwards Lifesciences' common stock (the "Distribution") to Baxter stockholders of record on March 29, 2000, resulting in Edwards Lifesciences operating as an
independent entity commencing April 1, 2000 with publicly traded common stock. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the "Company" and "Edwards Lifesciences" refer to Edwards
Lifesciences Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Joint Venture in Japan

Subsequent to the Distribution, the cardiovascular business in Japan was being operated pursuant to a joint venture under which a Japanese subsidiary of Baxter
retained ownership of the Japanese business assets, but a subsidiary of Edwards Lifesciences held a 90% profit interest. From April 1, 2000 to
September 30, 2002, Edwards Lifesciences (a) recognized its shipments into the joint venture as sales at distributor price at the time the joint venture sold to the end customer, and
(b) utilized the equity method of accounting to record its 90% profit interest in the operations of the joint venture in Other Operating Income. Commencing October 1, 2002, the Company
acquired from Baxter the cardiovascular business in Japan and began reporting Japan's results on a fully consolidated basis. See Note 3 for more information.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using Baxter's historical bases in the assets and liabilities and the historical results of operations of
the Edwards Lifesciences Business prior to the Distribution, operated primarily as a division of Baxter, and continuing as a separate legal entity, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation and its
subsidiaries, subsequent to the Distribution. All material intercompany balances have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications of previously reported amounts have been made to conform to
classifications used in the current year.

Use of estimates

The consolidated financial statements of Edwards Lifesciences have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States
("GAAP") and have been applied consistently in all material respects. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, sales returns and reserves, rebate
reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts,


excess
and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, workers compensation, employee benefits, income taxes, asset impairment, anticipated transactions to be hedged, litigation
reserves and contingencies.

Fiscal year of international operations

Prior to 2001, certain operations outside the United States had been included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of fiscal years ending
November 30 in order to facilitate timely consolidation. This one-month lag was eliminated as of the beginning of 2001 for these international operations as it was no longer
required to achieve a timely consolidation. The December 2000 net loss from operations of $3.8 million for these entities was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings on
January 1, 2001.

Foreign currency translation

The Company follows the principles of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52, "

Foreign Currency
Translation

." Accordingly, when the local currency of its foreign entities is the functional currency, all assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at
the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate prevailing during the period. The effects of foreign currency
translation adjustments for these entities are deferred and included as a component of stockholders' equity. The effects of foreign currency transactions denominated in a currency other than its
foreign entities' functional currency are included in Other (Income) Expense, net.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue for sales when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists, product delivery and acceptance has occurred or
services have been rendered, and collection is reasonably assured. In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the
time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory. The Company enters into certain arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements to its customers. Revenue related
to an individual element is deferred unless delivery of the element represents a separate earnings process. Total revenue for these arrangements is allocated among the elements based on the fair value
of the individual elements, with the relative fair values determined based on objective evidence (generally based on sales of the individual element to other third parties).

The
Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force 01-9 as of January 1, 2002 and presents the cost of certain vendor considerations as reductions of revenue. Adoption of
this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns
and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. These adjustments include estimates for charge backs, rebates, returns, and other sales allowances. These provisions are
estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with wholesale and indirect customers. If
the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions does not properly reflect future activity, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows could
be impacted. The Company's


estimates
are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party data, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations.

Cash equivalents

The Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are
valued at cost, which approximates fair value.

Accounts receivable securitization

The Company accounts for the securitization of accounts receivable in accordance with SFAS No. 140, "

Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

." When the Company sells accounts receivable in securitizations, a subordinated residual interest in the
securitized portfolio is retained by the Company and recorded in Other Current Assets. Gain or loss on sale of the accounts receivable depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial
assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets sold and the residual interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Because quoted market prices are generally not
available to determine the Company's fair value of the residual interest, the Company estimates the fair value of the residual interest by estimating future expected credit losses to determine the
future expected cash flows, which generally approximate fair value given the securitized portfolio's short-term weighted average life. At the time the receivables are sold, the balances
are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs associated with the sale of receivables, primarily related to the discount and loss on sale, are included in Other (Income) Expense, net.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value. Market value for raw materials is based on
replacement costs, and for other inventory classifications is based on net realizable value.

Inventory
reserves result from inventory, which is obsolete, is nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), or is damaged or slow moving (defined
as quantities in excess of a two year supply). Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were approximately $8.5 million and $9.6 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company allocated $9.8 million, $9.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively, of general and
administrative costs to inventory. General and administrative costs included in both the December 31, 2003 and 2002 inventory balances were $3.5 and $2.8 million, respectively.


Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are principally calculated for financial reporting purposes on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 20 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and from 3 to 11 years for
machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility leases or the asset, whichever is shorter. Straight-line and accelerated methods of
depreciation are used for income tax purposes.

expense was $34.6 million, $29.6 million and $27.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Repairs and
maintenance expense was $12.1million, $9.1 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

,"
whereby goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review. As the Company's operations are comprised of one reporting unit, the Company reviews the recoverability
of its goodwill by comparing the Company's fair value to the net book value of its assets. If the book value of the Company's assets exceeds the Company's fair value, the goodwill is written down to
its implied fair value.

Additionally,
management reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangibles whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be
recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments. If
it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization
periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value. Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved. For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash
flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.


Patent Costs

The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications. The Company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of
issued patents for which success is deemed probable. The related costs are amortized over the remaining useful lives of the patents using the straight-line method. Such deferred costs are
periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability. To the extent the Company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement, costs
capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received.

Investments in unconsolidated affiliates

The Company has made investments in the equity instruments of other companies. These investments in unconsolidated affiliates are designated as
available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, "

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

." These investments are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders' equity as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method. The fair values of certain investments are based on quoted market prices. For other investments, various methods
are used to estimate fair value, including external valuations and discounted cash flows. When the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to
determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss:

•

the
duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost;

•

the
financial condition and near term prospects of the investee;

•

the
reasons for the decline in market value;

•

the
investee's performance against product development milestones; and

•

the
Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

As
of December 31, 2003, the Company had a $7.3 million unrealized loss related to a $12.6 million investment in a publicly traded company. Although the trading
value of the Company's investment has been less than the Company's original cost for greater than one year, the Company believes that this unrealized loss is temporary in nature due to the investee's
successful performance against its product development milestones and the historical high volatility of its stock price. Additionally, the Company has the ability and intent to hold the investment for
a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.


Income taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "

Accounting for Income Taxes

." Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. The
Company evaluates annually the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the
likelihood of realization are the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve
forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on
future earnings.

Research and development costs

Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred.

Earnings per share

Earnings per share are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128, "

Earnings per Share

," which requires the
Company to report both basic earnings per share, based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share, based on the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of outstanding stock options.

A
reconciliation of the shares used in the basic and diluted per share computations is as follows:

earnings per share excludes 3.2 million, 2.1 million and 0.3 million shares related to options for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. These options were excluded because the exercise price per share was greater than the average market price, resulting in an anti-dilutive effect on diluted earnings per
share. The effect of approximately 2.7 million common shares relating to the Company's $150.0 million convertible debentures due 2033 has been excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2003 because none of the conditions that would permit the debentures to be converted to the common shares had been satisfied.


Employee Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans

The Company applies the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

," in accounting for its fixed stock option and employee stock purchase plans. In accordance with this intrinsic value method, no compensation expense is recognized
for these plans. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "

Derivatives

Edwards Lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial
instruments to mitigate its exposure to significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by volatility in interest rate and currency exchange rates. Derivative instruments that are used as part
of the Company's interest and foreign exchange rate management strategy include interest rate swaps, option-based products and forward exchange contracts. These instruments are designated as cash flow
hedges. Edwards Lifesciences does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

The
Company uses interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. The Company's interest rate swap agreements involve agreements to pay a
fixed rate and receive a floating rate, at specified intervals, calculated on an agreed-upon notional amount. The debt and amounts that the Company hedges are determined based on
prevailing market conditions and the current shape of the yield curve. Interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions.

The
Company utilizes forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to forecasted intercompany foreign currency transactions. These contracts provide
for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange rates. These contracts are entered into to reduce the risk that the Company's earnings and cash flows
resulting from certain forecasted intercompany transactions will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Derivative
instruments used by Edwards Lifesciences involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk, in the event a counterparty should default, and market risk, as the instruments
are subject to rate and price fluctuations. Credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines, counterparty diversification, monitoring of counterparty financial condition and
International Swap Dealers Association master netting agreements in place with all derivative counterparties. All derivative financial instruments are with commercial banks and investment banking
firms assigned investment grade ratings of "AA" or better with national rating agencies.

All
derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. On the date that the Company enters into a derivative contract, it designates the derivative as either
(a) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows that are to be received or paid in connection with a recognized asset or liability (a "cash flow" hedge), or
(b) a hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or an unrecognized firm commitment (a "fair value" hedge). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is
highly effective, and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income until earnings are
affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction (e.g., until periodic settlements of a variable asset or liability are recorded in earnings). Any hedge ineffectiveness (which
represents the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the derivative exceed the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction) is recorded in current-period earnings. Changes
in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, and that is designated and qualifies as a foreign-currency hedge, are recorded in either current-period earnings or Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income, depending on whether the hedging relationship satisfies the criteria for a fair-value or cash flow hedge.


The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses (both at
the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and
whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. All components of each derivative's gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

When
it is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. A derivative ceases to be
highly effective when (a) the Company determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item such as firm commitments or forecasted
transactions, (b) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, (c) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or (d) management
determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.

When
the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, the gain or loss on the
derivative remains in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However, if it is probable that a forecasted
transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will be recognized immediately in earnings. In a situation in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will
carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value in current-period earnings.

Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income encompasses all changes in equity other than those arising from transactions with stockholders, and consists of net income, currency
translation adjustments, pension adjustments, unrealized net gains and losses on cash flow hedges and investments in unconsolidated affiliates.

Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2001, Edwards Lifesciences adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

," as amended. SFAS No. 133 requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities, measured at fair
value. Accounting for the gain or loss due to changes in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative qualifies as a hedge. If the derivative instrument does not qualify
as a hedge, the gains or losses are reported in earnings when they occur. If the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge, the accounting varies based upon the type of risk being hedged. Adopting
the provisions of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in a one-time cumulative after-tax increase in net loss of


$1.5 million.
In addition, the Company recorded the following one-time cumulative after-tax adjustments in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:

Effective
January 1, 2001, Edwards Lifesciences adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 140, "

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities

." This statement replaces SFAS No. 125 and revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial
assets and collateral. SFAS No. 140 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. This statement was
effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2000. Adoption
of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

." SFAS No. 142, which changes the
accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. No transition adjustment was
recorded upon adoption of this standard on January 1, 2002. However, adoption of this standard resulted in the elimination of goodwill amortization commencing January 1, 2002. See
Note 8 for more information.

In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

." SFAS No. 143, which
changes the accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs, is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2002. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets

." SFAS
No. 144, which changes the accounting and reporting for the impairment of
long-lived assets, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.

In
July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

." SFAS
No. 146 changes the accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity, including certain costs incurred in
a restructuring. The provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of this standard did not have a material
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure

." This
standard amends SFAS No. 123, "

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to
the fair value


based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Standard amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual
and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. This standard is effective for financial
statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted this standard and has made the necessary changes to its financial statement disclosures.

In
January 2003, the FASB issued and in December 2003, revised, FASB Interpretation No. 46 "

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities—an interpretation of ARB No. 51

." This interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities which have
certain characteristics. The effective date of this interpretation varies based on certain criteria. The Company is required to apply all of this interpretation no later than the end of the first
reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. The Company is evaluating one entity to determine if it qualifies as a variable interest entity and if the entity will need to be consolidated.
This entity had $10.1 million of assets as of September 30, 2003 and had $0.4 million of net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003.

In
April 2003, the FASB issued, SFAS No. 149, "

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

."
SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities
under SFAS No. 133, "

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

". This standard is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003, with exception for specified transactions. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity

." SFAS No. 150 establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS
No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. Adoption of this standard did not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. On October 1, 2002, the Company acquired from Baxter for $19.0 million,
net, the cardiovascular business in Japan. The purchase price excluded approximately $30 million of securitized accounts receivable. In the three months ended September 30, 2002, the
Company recorded a $3.3 million charge for legal, administrative and regulatory expenses related to the acquisition reflected in special charges on the Statement of Operations for the year
ended December 31, 2002. Commencing October 1, 2002, the Company began reporting the results of the Japan business on a fully consolidated basis. The acquisition did not materially
impact the Company's net income as the terms of the joint venture agreement enabled Edwards Lifesciences to record substantially all of the net profit generated by the Japan business (see
Note 1).


3.    ACQUISITION OF JOINT VENTURE IN JAPAN

4.    LOSS ON SALE OF STOCK

Effective June 30, 2001, the Company sold the stock of Edwards Lifesciences Cardiovascular Resources, Inc. ("ELCR") to Fresenius Medical Care AG for
cash proceeds of $45.0 million (the "ELCR Sale"), resulting in a loss of $68.2 million (including the write-off of $83.0 million of goodwill). ELCR provided and
managed perfusionists, monitoring systems, capital equipment and disposable material on a contract service basis to hospitals in the United States and Puerto Rico.

The
following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations gives effect to the ELCR Sale as if it had occurred on January 1, 2001, and excludes the

5.    ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

In September 2002, the Company recorded a $67.4 million charge related to the impairment of its investment in preferred stock of World Heart
Corporation ("WorldHeart"). The investment was written down to $6.2 million, which represented the value of the Company's preferred stock investment had it been converted into common stock at
October 15, 2002 (the closing date of September's books). The decision to record the charge was based primarily on WorldHeart's September 2002 decision to refocus its product development
efforts by adopting a new design concept for a next generation product that resulted in a significant delay (approximately two years) in its product development timeline (with a revised commercial
launch date of 2007) and impaired WorldHeart's competitive position. Accordingly, the Company concluded that sufficient risk existed that WorldHeart may be unable to fully liquidate the Company's
investment in WorldHeart's preferred stock. The Company believed that the best objective indicator of the then fair value of its investment in WorldHeart's preferred stock was the market price of
WorldHeart's common stock based upon the Company's expectation that the value of its preferred stock investment would be realized through the common stock, as opposed to redemption of the preferred
stock.

Based
upon the non-strategic nature and declining profitability of certain products in the Company's portfolio (including certain distributed products), the Company decided
during the quarter ended June 30, 2001 to discontinue its sales effort of these products. The long-lived assets and the investments related to these products were evaluated to
determine whether any impairment in their recoverability existed at the determination date. As a result, Edwards Lifesciences assessed whether the estimated cash flows of the products or investments
over the estimated lives of the related assets were sufficient to recover their costs. Where such cash flows were insufficient, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair
value of assets or investments and recorded an


impairment
charge to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair values. As a result of this evaluation, Edwards Lifesciences recorded a $14.8 million charge related to the impairment of
intangible assets ($8.3 million), the impairment of an investment ($5.5 million) and the write-down of non-productive assets ($1.0 million).

6.    SPECIAL CHARGES

Purchased in-process Research and Development Expenses

On February 18, 2003, the Company acquired the endovascular mitral valve repair program of Jomed N.V., a European-based provider of products for minimally
invasive vascular intervention, for $20.0 million in cash. The acquisition included all technology and intellectual property associated with the program. At the acquisition date, the program,
which was less than 50% complete, was involved in testing proprietary prototypes prior to initiating required animal studies and human clinicals. Additional design improvements, bench testing, animal
studies and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling the product in Europe (expected in 2005) and in the United States (expected in 2006). The risks and uncertainties
associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time include those related to the design, development and manufacturability of the product, the success of animal and clinical
studies and the timing of European and United States regulatory approvals. The fair market value of the assets acquired consisted primarily of patents that are being amortized over their estimated
economic life of 17 years. Approximately $11.8 million of the purchase price has been charged to in-process research and development. The value of the in-process
research and development was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate used was 30%. The valuation assumed approximately
$20 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction. In the valuation, material net cash inflows were forecasted to
commence in 2008.

On
December 5, 2003, the Company acquired the stock of Whitland Research Limited ("Whitland") for $3.2 million in cash, although achievement of future milestones through
2006 could increase the total price to $5.6 million. Whitland was focused on the development of critical care monitoring technologies. The $3.2 million purchase price was allocated to
acquired in-process research and development ($1.8 million) and patents ($1.4 million) based upon their estimated fair values. The patents will be amortized over their
estimated useful life of 10 years.


Severance Charge

In July 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $13.0 million associated with a decision to streamline operations. The charge was primarily related
to the severance costs associated with reducing the Company's worldwide workforce by 136 employees, primarily in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2003, $4.1 million of
the charge remained unpaid.

Baxter Arbitration Settlement

In January 2004, the Company concluded a dispute resolution proceeding with Baxter. Each company sought reimbursement from the other for a variety of
claims arising from the Company's spin-off from Baxter in April 2000. The resolution resulted in a $5.3 million charge primarily related to the valuation of receivables at
the date of spin-off, and a $5.4 million increase to Additional Contributed Capital related to the true-up of the beginning balance of equity.

Loss on Sale of Business

Effective July 4, 2003, the Company sold its German perfusion services subsidiary to WKK GmbH, a German-based provider of hospital services, for a nominal
amount. Sales generated by the German perfusion services subsidiary were approximately $3.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2003 and $6.6 million for the year 2002.
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

," and Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 100, "

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

," the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $3.3 million in the
second quarter of 2003 to reduce the carrying value of the subsidiary's assets to fair value based upon the proceeds from the sale.

Pension Curtailment

On November 4, 2003, the Company suspended its defined benefit pension plan in Puerto Rico ("the Plan"). Effective December 31, 2003, employees do
not earn additional defined benefits for future services. To mitigate the Puerto Rico employees' reduced benefits from the Plan's suspension, effective January 1, 2004, the Company increased
its contributions to the Puerto Rico 1165(e) defined contribution plan. In accordance with SFAS No. 88, "

Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits

," the Company recorded a curtailment loss of $1.9 million during the fourth quarter 2003. As of
December 31, 2003, the Plan's accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of its assets by $2.4 million.

Spin-Off Expenses

The Company recorded a $3.3 million charge for legal, administrative and regulatory expenses related to the October 2002 acquisition of the
cardiovascular business in Japan (see "Joint Venture in Japan").


7.    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION

Edwards Lifesciences has two agreements (the "Japan Receivables Facility" and the "U.S. Receivables Facility," or the "Facilities") with financial institutions
whereby it securitizes, on a continuous basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible trade account receivables. In December 2002, the Company entered into the Japan Receivables Facility
whereby the Company's Japanese subsidiary (Edwards Lifesciences Japan Limited) sells eligible accounts receivable directly to a financial institution. Under the U.S. Receivables Facility, the Company
sells eligible accounts receivable to a wholly-owned, special purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary formed for the purpose of buying and selling these receivables, which then sells the participating
interests in the receivables to a financial institution.

The
transactions under both Facilities are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable. The Company retained servicing responsibilities and subordinated residual interests in the
accounts receivables. The Company receives annual servicing fees approximating one percent of the outstanding balance and rights to future cash flows arising after the investors in the securitization
trust have received their contractual return. No servicing asset or liability has been recorded as the Company's compensation for servicing the assets approximates the cost of its servicing
responsibilities. The investors and the securitization trust have no recourse to the Company's other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The Company's residual interests are subordinate to
the investors' interests. The U.S. Receivables Facility is renewable for one-year periods at the Company's option and will expire on December 21, 2004. The Japan Receivables
Facility will expire on December 3, 2005.

Sales
of receivables under these programs result in a reduction of accounts receivable on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Residual interests of $14.2 million and
$9.2 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are included in Other Current Assets. The interests are carried at their fair value, estimated as the net realizable value,
which considers the relatively short liquidation period and includes an estimated provision for credit losses. Pursuant to the terms of the Facilities, the Company had sold $91.2 million and
$76.5 million of trade accounts receivable as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, resulting in a reduction of accounts receivable on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets,
and received funding of $76.9 million and $67.1 million, respectively. Costs associated with the sale of receivables, primarily related to the discount and loss on sale, were
$0.8 million, $1.6 million and $1.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are included in Other (Income) Expense, net.

8.    GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

,"
whereby goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review, performed by the Company in the fourth quarter of each year. As the Company's operations are comprised
of one reporting unit, the Company reviews the recoverability of its goodwill by comparing the Company's fair value to the net book value of its assets. If the book value of the Company's assets
exceeds the Company's fair value, the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. The impairment analyses were completed in the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002 and resulted in no impairments.


Pursuant
to SFAS No. 142, the results for periods prior to adoption are not to be restated. If SFAS No. 142 had been effective January 1, 2001, net loss and earnings
per basic and diluted share would have been as follows for the year ended December 31, 2001 (in millions, except per share information):

In
April 2003, the Company purchased the technology and intellectual property associated with Embol-X Inc.'s surgically placed, intra-aortic embolic management
system. The total consideration for Embol-X Inc. was $13.6 million, comprised of $8.0 million cash, a deferred payment of $2.0 million cash payable upon the
completion of the technology transfer (which was completed during August 2003), stock in an unconsolidated affiliated company valued at $3.0 million and $0.6 million of
capitalized transaction costs. In accordance with the guidance provided in Emerging Issues Task Force 98-3, "

Determining Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves
Receipt of Productive Assets or of a Business

," the transaction was accounted for as a purchased business combination. The purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets
at their estimated fair value as follows (in millions):

prior to April 16, 2008, the Company's sales of medical devices from the transferred technology are at least $20.0 million in any consecutive 12-month
period, the Company will pay an additional $5.0 million to Embol-X Inc. This contingent obligation has not been recorded in the Company's balance sheet as of
December 31, 2003. Forecasted sales of medical devices from the transferred technology are expected to be less than $2.0 million for 2004.

10.    LONG-TERM DEBT, CREDIT FACILITIES AND LEASE OBLIGATIONS

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had two unsecured revolving credit agreements providing for up to an aggregate of $530.0 million in
one- to six-month borrowings in multiple currencies. Borrowings currently bear interest at the London interbank offering rate (LIBOR) plus 0.75%, which includes a facility fee.
One of the credit agreements provides for long-term borrowings up to an aggregate of $430.0 million and expires on March 30, 2005 (the "Five Year Credit Facility"). The other
credit agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of $100.0 million through March 25, 2004


(the
"364 Day Facility"). As the 364 Day Facility has not been used recently, the Company does not plan to renew this credit agreement when it expires. As of December 31, 2003, borrowings of
$105.8 million were outstanding under the Five Year Credit Facility and no borrowings were outstanding under the 364 Day Facility. Edwards Lifesciences pays a facility fee, regardless of
available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.15% for the $430 million credit agreement, and 0.125% for the $100 million credit agreement. All amounts outstanding
under the Five Year Credit Facility have been classified as long-term obligations, as these borrowings will continue to be refinanced pursuant to that credit agreement. In
March 2004, the Company will reclassify any balance outstanding on the Five Year Credit Facility to short-term as the agreement will expire within one year. The credit facilities
contain various financial and other covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2003.

In
May 2003, the Company issued $150.0 million of convertible senior debentures, issued at par, bearing an interest rate of 3.875% per annum due May 15, 2033 (the
"Notes"). Interest is payable semi-annually in May and November. Issuance costs of approximately $3.6 million are being amortized to interest expense over 5 years. The Notes
are convertible into 18.29 shares of the Company's common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes (conversion price of $54.66 per share), subject to adjustment. The Notes may be converted, at
the option of the holders, on or prior to the final maturity date under any of the following circumstances:

•

during
any fiscal quarter, if the closing sale price per share of the Company's common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price;

•

if
the Notes have been called for redemption; or

•

upon
the occurrence of specified corporate events.

Holders
of the Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and
unpaid interest on May 15, 2008, 2013, and 2018. The Company will pay cash for all Notes so purchased on May 15, 2008. For any Notes purchased by the Company on May 15, 2013 or
2018, the Company may, at its option, choose to pay the purchase price in cash, in shares of the Company's common stock, or any combination thereof. The Company must pay all accrued and unpaid
interest in cash.

The
Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at any time on or after May 15, 2008, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be
redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Beginning
with the six-month interest period commencing May 15, 2008, holders of the Notes will receive contingent interest at a rate of 0.25% if the trading price of
the Notes equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amounts of the Notes. This contingent interest payment feature represents an embedded derivative. Based on the immaterial value associated with this
feature, no value has been assigned to the derivative at issuance or at December 31, 2003.

Edwards
Lifesciences utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of
specific debt transactions. Edwards Lifesciences' interest rate swap agreements involve agreements to receive a floating rate and pay a fixed rate, at specified intervals, calculated on an
agreed-upon notional amount. As of December 31, 2003, Edwards Lifesciences had in place four interest rate swaps with a total


notional
amount of $155.8 million to swap floating rate United States dollar and Yen denominated debt obtained under the Company's revolving credit facilities for fixed rates. The original
maturities of the interest rate swap agreements are between three and five years.

The
weighted average interest rate under the Credit Facilities was 5.6% at December 31, 2003, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements. The rates have been calculated
using rates in effect at December 31, 2003.

Future
minimum lease payments (including interest) under noncancelable operating leases and aggregate debt maturities at December 31, 2003 were as follows:

was $12.3 million, $6.8 million, and $6.1 million for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

11.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

Fair values of financial instruments

The consolidated financial statements include financial instruments whereby the fair market value of such instruments may differ from amounts reflected on a
historical basis. Financial instruments of the Company consist of cash deposits, accounts and other receivables, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, accounts payable, certain accrued liabilities
and debt. The fair values of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates are estimated based on quoted market prices. For other investments, various methods are used to estimate fair value,
including external valuations and discounted cash flows. The carrying amount of the Company's long-term debt approximates fair market value based on prevailing


market
rates. The Company's other financial instruments generally approximate their fair values based on the short-term nature of these instruments.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company utilizes a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its currency exchange rate and interest rate risk as summarized below. The Company
does not enter into these arrangements for trading or speculation purposes.

The
fair value of financial instruments was estimated by discounting expected cash flows using quoted market interest rates and foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2003 and
2002. Notional amounts are stated in United States dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the respective dates. Considerable judgment was employed in interpreting market data to develop
estimates of fair value; accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different
market assumptions or valuation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

At
December 31, 2003, the fair value of option-based products, forward currency and interest rate swap agreements is recorded in Accrued Liabilities. During the year ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income a net loss of $9.3 million and a net gain of $5.9 million, respectively, to Cost
of Goods Sold, and a net loss of $5.7 million and $5.0 million, respectively, to Interest Expense, Net. The Company expects that during the next 12 months it will reclassify to
earnings a $6.2 million loss currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. For the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company expensed $1.1 million and
$1.3 million, respectively, related to the time value of option-based products.

12.    COMMON STOCK

The Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Long-Term Stock Incentive Compensation Program (the "Program") provides for the grant of incentive and
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentive awards for eligible employees and contractors of the Company. Under the Program, these grants are generally
awarded at a price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant based upon the closing price on the date immediately preceding the grant date. Options to purchase shares of the Company's common
stock granted under the Program generally vest over predetermined periods and expire 7 years after the date of grant. An aggregate of 15.5 million shares of the Company's common stock
has been reserved for issuance under the Program.


On April 3, 2000, the Company granted options to purchase shares of Edwards Lifesciences' common stock under the Program. The grants include two types of stock options: Founders
Options and Conversion Options. The Founders Options were awarded to all salaried employees of the Company and permit the purchase of approximately 5.7 million shares at an exercise price of
$13.88, the fair market value at the date of grant. The Founders Options vested 30% on April 3, 2002, and the balance vested on April 3, 2003. The Founders Options included approximately
634,000 options granted to non-employees of the Company in Japan (employees of Baxter dedicated to the joint venture as described in Notes 1 and 3). In accordance with SFAS No. 123,
"

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"

the $4.0 million value of these options was amortized over the three-year vesting period
on a straight-line basis. The Conversion Options permitted the purchase of approximately 2.2 million shares at an exercise price based upon an equitable conversion of the exercise
price under the Baxter stock option plan, with reference to the when-issued price of the Company's stock and the closing price of Baxter's common stock on March 31, 2000. The
Conversion Options retained the vesting periods under the Baxter stock option plan, resulting in various vesting periods. All of the Conversion Options were vested as of the end of
September 2002.

The
Company also maintains the Nonemployee Directors and Consultants Stock Incentive Program (the "Nonemployee Program"). Under the Nonemployee Program, each non-employee
director annually receives 10,000 stock options. Additionally, each non-employee director may elect to receive all or a portion of the cash retainer to which the director is otherwise
entitled through the issuance of stock options. As of December 31, 2003, 208,293 options were issued under the Nonemployee Program.

Restricted Stock

A one-time grant of 5,000 shares of restricted stock was made to each of the non-employee directors pursuant to the
Non-employee Program. These grants vest 50% after one year and the balance vests after two years from the date of grant. An aggregate of 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock has
been authorized for issuance pursuant to the Non-Employee Program. Grants of restricted stock to non-employees are charged to unearned compensation in Stockholders' Equity at
their intrinsic value and recognized as expense over the vesting period. Compensation expense recognized for such grants was approximately $0.1 million for each of 2003 and 2002, and
$0.2 million for 2001.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has two employee stock purchase plans ("ESPP") for eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair
market value of Edwards Lifesciences common stock on the effective date of subscription or the date of purchase. Under the ESPP, employees can authorize the Company to withhold up to 12% of their
compensation for common stock purchases, subject to certain limitations. The ESPP is available to all active employees of the Company paid from the United States payroll and to eligible employees of
the Company outside the United States to the extent permitted by local law. The ESPP for United States employees is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Board of
Directors authorized an aggregate of 2,150,000 shares of the Company's common stock for issuance under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2003, 731,606 shares have been issued under the plans.

Stockholder Rights Plan

The Company has adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan to protect stockholders' rights in the event of a proposed or actual acquisition of 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. As part of this plan, each share of the Company's common stock carries a right to purchase one one-hundredth (1/100) of a share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the "Rights"), par value $0.01 per share, subject to adjustment, which becomes exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events. The Rights
are subject to redemption at the option of the Board of Directors at a price of $0.01 per right until the occurrence of certain events. The Rights expire on March 31, 2010, unless earlier
redeemed or exchanged by the Company.


Treasury Stock

In November 2001, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in
privately negotiated transactions up to 2.0 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. In addition, on May 6, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors approved a second
stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase an additional 2.0 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock through December 31, 2005. Stock repurchased under
these programs will primarily be used to offset obligations under the Company's employee stock option programs. During 2003 and 2002, the Company repurchased 1,766,300 and 1,298,300 shares at an
aggregate cost of $49.4 and $30.8 million, respectively. The timing and size of any future stock repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions, stock prices and
other cash requirements.

13.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Plans

Prior to the Distribution, Edwards Lifesciences employees participated in Baxter-sponsored defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees in
the United States and Puerto Rico and
employees in certain European countries. The benefits were based on years of service and the employees' compensation during five of the last 10 years of employment as defined by the plans.
Effective as of the Distribution, Edwards Lifesciences' employees ceased to be eligible to accrue any additional benefits under the Baxter plan for United States employees. Edwards Lifesciences did
not adopt a pension plan for United States employees to replace the Baxter plan in the United States. The pension liability related to Edwards Lifesciences' United States employees' service prior to
the Distribution remains with Baxter. With respect to the Puerto Rico and certain European plans, Baxter transferred the assets and liabilities relating to Edwards Lifesciences' employees to Edwards
Lifesciences as of the Distribution. Edwards Lifesciences has adopted a defined benefit pension plan in Puerto Rico and in certain European countries. On November 4, 2003, the Company suspended
its defined benefit pension plan in Puerto Rico ("the Plan"). Effective December 31, 2003, employees do not earn additional defined benefits for future services. To mitigate the Puerto Rico
employees' reduced benefits from the Plan's suspension, the Company increased its contributions to the Puerto Rico 1165(e) defined contribution plan.

On
October 1, 2002, the Company completed its spin-off from Baxter and acquired the cardiovascular business in Japan (see Notes 1 and 3). As part of the transaction,
the Company acquired the defined benefit plan that covered the Japan employees and the related pension assets and liabilities.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company's employees in the United States and Puerto Rico are eligible to participate in a qualified 401(k) and 1165(e) plan, respectively. In the United
States, participants may contribute up to 25% of their annual compensation (subject to tax code limitation) to the plan. Edwards Lifesciences matches the first 3 percent of the participant's
annual eligible compensation contributed to the plan on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Edwards Lifesciences matches the next 2 percent of the participant's annual eligible
compensation to the plan on a 50% basis. In Puerto Rico, participants may contribute up to 10% of their annual compensation (subject to tax code limitation) to the plan. Edwards Lifesciences matches
the first 6 percent of the participant's annual eligible compensation contributed to the plan on a 50% basis. Matching contributions relating to Edwards Lifesciences employees were
$4.4 million, $4.4 million and $3.9 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The
Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for a select group of management that provides the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their cash compensation.
Participants may elect to defer up to 100% of bonus and 25% of total annual compensation. The Company's obligations under this plan are unfunded. The amount accrued under this plan was
$5.5 million and $3.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The
Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Executive Option Plan (the "Executive Plan") became effective for participation by eligible employees in 2001. Eligible employees who participate in
the Executive Plan may not participate in the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Under the Executive Plan, executive officers and certain other key employees may elect to forgo a
portion of their annual salary and bonus for an option to purchase shares of mutual funds or the Company's


common
stock. The options are granted quarterly with an initial exercise price equal to 25% of the fair market value per share (as defined in the Executive Plan) of the respective security on the
grant date. The number of shares subject to each option is determined such that the difference between the aggregate fair market value (as defined in the Executive Plan) and the aggregate exercise
price under the option is equal to the amount of forgone compensation attributable to the option. A total of 95,000 shares of the Company's common stock have been registered for issuance under the
Executive Plan.

14.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Effective on the Distribution, Baxter and Edwards Lifesciences entered into a series of administrative services agreements pursuant to which Baxter and Edwards
Lifesciences continued to provide, for a specified period of time, certain administrative services (primarily information systems support, payroll, accounting and warehousing and logistics support)
that each entity historically provided to the other. These agreements required the parties to pay each other a fee that approximated the actual costs of these services. Additionally, subsequent to
March 31, 2000, Edwards Lifesciences had continuing relationships with Baxter as a customer and supplier for certain products, and used Baxter as a distributor of the Company's products in
certain regions of the world. Substantially all of these service agreements and relationships had been terminated as of December 31, 2002.

Sales
to Baxter, acting in the capacity of the Company's distributor subsequent to the Distribution, represented approximately 8% and 11% of the Company's total net sales for 2002 and
2001, respectively.

In
December 2001, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company received a $2.5 million loan pursuant to his employment agreement with the Company as approved by the Board of
Directors. The loan was used for the purchase of his primary residence in connection with his relocation. The loan is non-interest bearing and is due in December 2006 or upon
resignation or the termination of employment. The loan is collateralized by the Chief Executive Officer's primary residence.

At
December 31, 2003, the Company had deferred tax assets of $107.9 million, partially offset by deferred tax liabilities of $17.2 million. The valuation allowance
of $19.5 million as of December 31, 2003 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax
assets established for certain investments and the net operating loss carryforwards of certain non-United States subsidiaries.

During
2003, the Company recapitalized its Japan subsidiary. As a result, a deemed dividend occurred for U.S. tax purposes resulting in an incremental tax provision of
$6.2 million, net of foreign tax credits. The recapitalization was a one-time event and all of the future earnings of the Company's Japan subsidiary are intended to be permanently
reinvested.

Deferred
income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries of approximately $121.7 million as of December 31, 2003
since these amounts are intended to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations. It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with these earnings; however, foreign tax credits
would likely be available to reduce federal income taxes in the event of distribution.

The
Company has manufacturing operations outside the United States, primarily in Puerto Rico, Switzerland and The Dominican Republic, which benefit from reductions in local tax rates
under various tax incentives.

During
2003, the Company commenced a legal reorganization of its Brazil subsidiary to improve its balance sheet and to enhance its ability to conduct business in Brazil. Since being
acquired a number of years ago, this subsidiary has incurred net operating losses primarily due to the devaluation of the local currency and interest expense incurred on inter-company debt. In
addition, the reorganizing allowed the Company to recognize the accumulated losses and inter-company debt write-off under United States tax law, resulting in federal and state tax benefits
of $13.7 million.

As
a result of tax law developments in 2002, the Company recorded a $20.1 million tax benefit during 2002 related to the loss on sale of its United States perfusion services
business in June 2001.

In
exchange for the sale of the Novacor mechanical cardiac assist product line to WorldHeart in June 2000, the Company received WorldHeart preferred stock. In 2002, the investment
in the WorldHeart preferred stock was deemed to be impaired and written down to its fair market value. Due to the uncertainty of using any potential tax benefit for the loss, a valuation allowance of
$13.8 million was established.

As
of December 31, 2003, the Company has approximately $42.9 million of U.S. federal and state tax net operating losses and $17.9 million of tax credits available
for carry-forward that will begin to expire in 2008 if not utilized. The Company also has approximately $54.3 million of foreign tax net operating losses available for carry-forward that will
begin to expire in 2005 if not utilized and approximately $0.9 million of non-expiring tax credits that are available for carry-over. A valuation allowance of
$5.7 million has been provided on certain foreign net operating losses.

The
U.S. federal income tax return filed by Edwards for the short period ended December 31, 2000 is being examined by the Internal Revenue Service. Management believes that
adequate amounts


of
tax and related interest, if any, have been provided for any adjustments that may result for the short period ended December 31, 2000.

17.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On June 29, 2000, Edwards Lifesciences filed a lawsuit against St. Jude Medical, Inc. alleging infringement of three Edwards Lifesciences United
States patents. This lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. St. Jude has answered and asserted
various affirmative defenses and counterclaims with respect to the lawsuits. On April 9, 2002, a fourth Edwards Lifesciences United States patent was added to the lawsuit. Discovery is
proceeding.

On
August 18, 2003, Edwards Lifesciences filed a lawsuit against Medtronic, Inc., Medtronic AVE, Cook, Inc. and W.L. Gore & Associates alleging infringement
of a patent exclusively licensed to the Company. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. Each
of the defendants has answered and asserted various affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Discovery is proceeding.

In
addition, Edwards Lifesciences is, or may be, a party to, or may be otherwise responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or
formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by Edwards Lifesciences. Such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and
complexities, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. Upon
resolution of any pending legal matters, Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges in excess of presently established reserves. While such a charge could have a material adverse impact on Edwards
Lifesciences' net income or net cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid, management believes that no such charge would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences'
consolidated financial position.

Edwards
Lifesciences is also subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the United States. The operations of Edwards Lifesciences, like those of
other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While it is difficult to quantify the
potential impact of compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

18.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

Edwards Lifesciences manages its business on the basis of one reportable segment. Refer to Note 1 for a description of the Company's business. The
Company's products and services share similar distribution channels and customers and are sold principally to hospitals and physicians. Management evaluates its various global product portfolios on a
revenue basis, which is presented below, and profitability is evaluated on an enterprise-wide basis due to shared infrastructures. Edwards Lifesciences' principal markets are the United
States, Europe and Japan.

19.    SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On January 27, 2004, the Company acquired Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc. ("PVT") for $125.0 million in cash, plus up to an additional
$30.0 million upon the achievement of key milestones through 2007. The Company expects to take an initial in-process research and development charge related to this transaction in
the first quarter of 2004, estimated between $60.0 million and $90.0 million. The remainder of the purchase price will be allocated to patents involving PVT's proprietary technology.
PVT, located in Fort Lee, NJ, with a subsidiary in Israel, is a leader in the development of an innovative, catheter-based (percutaneous) approach for replacing aortic heart valves. PVT's technology
is a combination balloon-expandable stent technology integrated with a percutaneously delivered tissue heart valve. Unlike conventional open-heart valve replacement surgery, this
less-invasive procedure is designed to be performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory under local anesthesia.
