PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the “Company”) is the United States’
second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry, including
highways, infrastructure, commercial and residential. The Company also
manufactured and marketed in 2000 magnesia-based products, including
heat-resistant refractory products for the steel industry, chemicals products
for industrial, agricultural and environmental uses, and dolomitic lime. In
2000, the Company’s aggregates business accounted for 90% of the Company’s
total revenues and the Company’s magnesia-based products segment accounted for
10% of the Company’s total revenues.

The Company was formed in November 1993 as a North Carolina corporation to
be the successor to substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the
materials group of Martin Marietta Corporation and its subsidiaries. An
initial public offering of a portion of the common stock of the Company (the
“Common Stock”) was completed in February 1994 whereby 8,797,500 shares of
Common Stock (representing approximately 19% of the shares outstanding) were
sold at an initial public offering price of $23 per share. Lockheed Martin
Corporation, which was formed as the result of a business combination between
Martin Marietta Corporation and Lockheed Corporation in March 1995, owned
approximately 81% of the Common Stock directly and through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Martin Marietta Investments Inc., until October 1996.

In October 1996, the outstanding Common Stock of Martin Marietta Materials
that was held by Lockheed Martin Corporation became available to the public
market when Lockheed Martin disposed of its 81% ownership interest. This
transaction was completed by means of a tax-free exchange offer pursuant to
which Lockheed Martin stockholders were given the opportunity to exchange
shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of the Company’s Common
Stock, which resulted in 100% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock being
publicly traded.

On May 28, 1997, the Company purchased all of the outstanding common stock
of American Aggregates Corporation (“American Aggregates”) along with certain
other assets from American Aggregates’ former parent, CSR America, Inc., for an
acquisition price of approximately $242 million in cash plus certain assumed
liabilities (the “American Aggregates Acquisition”). The American Aggregates
Acquisition included the Ohio and Indiana operations of American Aggregates
with 29 production facilities and increased the Company’s annual production
capacity by more than 25.0 million tons — in addition to adding over 1.0
billion tons of mineral reserves, of which approximately 700.0 million were
zoned for production, and 11,000 acres of property. American Aggregates is a
leading supplier of aggregates products in Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Dayton and
Columbus.

On December 4, 1998, the Company acquired the common stock of Redland
Stone Products Company (“Redland Stone”) from an affiliate of Lafarge SA for
$272 million in cash plus normal balance sheet liabilities and approximately $8
million estimated for certain other assumed liabilities and transaction costs.
The Company did not assume any long-term debt of Redland Stone. Redland Stone
is a leading producer of aggregates and asphaltic concrete in the state of
Texas and has mineral reserves which exceed 1.0 billion tons. Redland Stone
expanded the Aggregates division’s business by


adding operating facilities in the southwest United States, expanding the
Company’s presence in the asphalt production business and adding significant
long-term mineral reserve capacity.

As of October 31, 1998, the Company purchased an indirect initial 14%
interest in the business of Meridian Aggregates Company (“Meridian”). The
transaction provided a mechanism for the Company to purchase the remaining
interest in Meridian at a predetermined formula price within five years, and
the Meridian investors to require the Company to purchase their interests
beginning December 31, 2000, or earlier in the event of the death of an
investor. The Meridian investors exercised their option in September 2000, and
the Company expects to consummate the transaction whereby it will purchase all
of the remaining interests in Meridian early in the second quarter 2001 for
approximately $235 million, including the initial investment of $42
million, the retirement of debt, the forgiveness of related party obligations
and amounts estimated for certain other assumed liabilities and transaction
costs, plus the assumption of normal balance sheet liabilities. In 2000,
Meridian operated 25 aggregates production facilities and seven rail-served
distribution yards in 11 states in the southwestern and western United States
and sold approximately 23.0 million tons of aggregates to
customers in 14
states, including 6 states in which the Company has not previously conducted
any business. The Meridian transaction will add more than 1.6 billion tons of
aggregates reserves, expand the Company’s presence in the southwest and western
states and increase its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation.

On February 23, 2001, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialties Inc., entered into an agreement with a
subsidiary of Minerals Technologies, Inc. to sell certain assets related to its
refractories business. In an accompanying manufacturing
agreement, Magnesia Specialties agreed to supply the subsidiary of Minerals
Technologies with certain refractories products principally from the Company’s
Manistee, Michigan plant for up to two years following the sale. The sale of
Magnesia Specialties’ refractories products will lessen the Magnesia
Specialties division’s dependence on the steel industry. Excluding refractories
products, Magnesia Specialties’ sales to the steel industry would account for
43% of the division’s 2000 net sales, as compared to 68% including
refractories. The agreement contemplates closing during the second
quarter 2001. The Company continues to explore additional opportunities
regarding the remaining Magnesia Specialties business, including possible
divestiture of all or part of the chemicals business, with a goal of creating
additional value for the Company. In this regard, the Company has determined
that the Woodville, Ohio operation will be transferred to the MidAmerica
Division of the Aggregates division. The Woodville, Ohio operation produces
and sells dolomitic lime to the steel industry and produces and sells more than
1.0 million tons per year of aggregates to construction businesses. There can
be no assurance that management will pursue additional opportunities regarding
the remaining Magnesia Specialties business, if any, or that they will result
in additional value.

The Company announced in February 1997 that it had entered into agreements
giving the Company rights to commercialize certain proprietary technologies
related to the Company’s business. One of the agreements gives the Company the
opportunity to pursue the use of certain composites technology for products
where corrosion resistance and high strength-to-weight ratios are important
factors, such as bridge decks, marine applications and other structures. The
Company continued its research and development activities during 2000 in this
new product area, and began manufacturing and marketing certain of the
products. This technology, if fully developed by the Company, would complement
and expand the Company’s business. In addition, the Company continued in 2000
to


explore the viability of certain technology related to remineralization of soil
and microbial products for enhanced plant growth. The Company had limited
revenue and no profits from these growth enhancement technologies in 2000.
Also, in 1999 and 2000 the Company made investments in a start-up company,
Industrial Microwave Systems, that has proprietary technology for use in
applications related to industrial heating and drying, food processing and
aseptic packaging. There can be no assurance that any of the technologies will
become profitable.

Business Segment Information

The Company in 2000 operated in two reportable business segments. These
segments are aggregates products and magnesia-based chemicals, refractories and
dolomitic lime products. Information concerning the Company’s net sales,
operating profit, assets employed and certain additional information
attributable to each reportable industry segment for each year in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2000 is included in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” on
pages 33 through 35 of the Company’s 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders (the
“2000 Annual Report”), which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Aggregates

The Company’s aggregates segment processes and sells granite, limestone,
sand and gravel and other aggregates products for use in all sectors of the
public infrastructure, commercial and residential construction industries. The
Company is the United States’ second largest producer of aggregates. In 2000,
the Company shipped approximately 164.9 million tons of aggregates primarily to
customers in 27 southeastern, southwestern, midwestern and central states, in
addition to Canada and the Bahamas, generating net sales and earnings from
operations of $1.2 billion and $194.2 million, respectively.

The Aggregates division markets its products primarily to the construction
industry, with approximately 46% of its shipments made to contractors in
connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the
balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with
commercial and residential construction projects. As a result of dependence
upon the construction industry, the profitability of aggregates producers is
sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions, and particularly
to cyclical swings in construction spending, which is affected by fluctuations
in interest rates, and demographic and population shifts and to changes in the
level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector. The Company’s
aggregates business is concentrated principally in the southeast, southwest,
midwest and central states. Aggregates products are sold and shipped from a
network of approximately 300 quarries and distribution facilities in more than
20 states, as well as the Bahamas and Canada, although the Company’s five
largest shipment states account for approximately 60% of total sales. The
Company’s business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions.

The Company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal, due primarily
to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its
markets. As a result of the American Aggregates Acquisition and several other
smaller acquisitions in the north central region of the United States, more of
the Company’s aggregates operations have exposure to weather-related risk
during the winter months. The division’s operations that are concentrated
principally in the north central region of the Midwest generally experience
more severe winter weather conditions than the division’s operations in the
Southeast and Southwest. Due to these factors, the Company’s second and third
quarters are


generally the strongest, with the first quarter generally reflecting the
weakest results, which are not necessarily indicative of the Company’s annual
results.

Aggregates can be found in abundant quantities throughout the United
States, and there are many producers nationwide. However, as a general rule,
shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of
transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value
of the product itself. As a result, proximity of quarry facilities to
customers is the most important factor in competition for aggregates business
and helps explain the highly fragmented nature of the aggregates industry. As
described below, the Company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks, but also
has access to a lower-cost river barge and ocean vessel network. In addition,
the Redland Stone transaction, the proposed Meridian transaction and other
recent acquisitions have enabled the Company to extend its reach through
increased access to rail transportation.

A growing percentage of the Company’s aggregates shipments are being moved
by rail or water through a distribution yard network. In 1994, 93% of the
Company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck, while the balance of 7% was
moved by rail. In contrast, the Company’s aggregates shipments were moved 80%
by truck, 10% by rail, and 10% by water in 2000. The Company has an extensive
network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the Ohio and
Mississippi River systems from western Pennsylvania throughout the central and
southern United States and the Bahamas, as well as distribution centers along
the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. The Gulf and Atlantic coastal areas
are being supplied primarily from the Bahamas location, two large quarries on
the Ohio River system and a Canadian quarry on the Strait of Canso in Nova
Scotia. In addition, the Company’s recent acquisitions, especially Redland
Stone and the proposed acquisition of Meridian, have expanded its ability to
ship by rail. Accordingly, in addition to increasing the Company’s geographic
presence through acquisitions, the Company has also enhanced its reach through
its ability to provide cost-effective coverage of certain coastal markets on
the east coast and reaching as far as Texas, and to ship products in and to
Canada, the Caribbean and parts of South America, as well as to additional
geographic areas which can be accessed economically by its expanded
distribution system. The Meridian operations will further expand the Company’s
markets and ability to ship by rail. Meridian operates 25 aggregates
production locations and seven rail-served distribution yards which serve
Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, Washington, and
California. The acquisition strengthens the Company’s position in the
southwest and central United States and will provide entry into markets in the
west.

Historically, the Company has focused on the production of aggregates and
has not integrated vertically in a substantial manner into other construction
materials businesses. In recent transactions, however, the Company has
acquired asphaltic concrete, ready mixed concrete, paving construction and
other businesses which establish vertical integration that complement its
aggregates business. These products and services are not a significant
component of the Company’s aggregates operations.

Environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult
for the construction aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to
develop new quarry operations. Although it cannot be predicted what policies
will be adopted in the future by federal, state and local governmental bodies
regarding these matters, the Company anticipates that future restrictions will
likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing
the value of the Company’s existing mineral reserves.


Management believes the Aggregates division’s raw materials, or mineral
reserves, are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for
the foreseeable future. The Company does not anticipate any material
difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for production in its
aggregates segment.

The Company generally delivers products in its aggregates segment upon
receipt of orders or requests from customers. Accordingly, there is no
significant backlog information. Inventory of aggregates is generally
maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of
customers.

Magnesia Specialties

The Company in 2000 also manufactured and marketed dolomitic lime and
magnesia-based products, including heat-resistant refractory products for the
steel industry and magnesia-based chemicals products for industrial,
agricultural and environmental uses, including wastewater treatment, sulfur
dioxide scrubbing and acid neutralization. The Company’s Magnesia Specialties
division generated net sales in 2000 of $130.4 million and earnings from
operations of $8.2 million. Approximately 44% of these sales are associated
with the refractories business which is proposed to be sold to a subsidiary of
Minerals Technologies in the second quarter 2001. Magnesia Specialties’
refractory and dolomitic lime products are sold primarily to the steel
industry. Accordingly, the division’s profitability depends on the production
of steel and the related marketplace, and a significant portion of the
division’s product pricing structure has historically been affected by current
economic conditions within the steel industry. The proposed sale of Magnesia
Specialties’ refractories business will lessen the Magnesia Specialties
division’s dependence on the steel industry over time.

In 2000, the division’s refractories and dolomitic lime product areas
continued to be negatively impacted by global steel industry conditions. The
division’s steel-related product areas’ performance followed the steel
industry’s performance. As a result, Magnesia Specialties experienced improved
operating earnings during the first-six months of 2000 compared with the
prior-year period. However, the slowdown experienced in the steel industry
during the second half of 2000 and higher-than-expected costs for natural gas,
which is used to fuel some of the division’s kilns in the manufacture of its
products, negatively affected earnings from operations for the full year 2000.
Competitive pricing pressures continued throughout 2000. Consolidation among
manufacturers of refractory brick removed a significant periclase customer from
the market during the year. The division’s chemicals products continued to
diversify in chemicals used as flame retardants, in wastewater treatment and to
reduce stack pollution, and is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the
refractories business.

The principal raw materials used in the Company’s Magnesia Specialties
division’s products are dolomitic lime, brine and imported magnesia.
Management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone to produce
dolomitic lime and its reserves of brine are sufficient to permit production at
the required operational levels for the foreseeable future, which levels
are expected to be lower over time than present operational
levels as a result of the proposed sale of the refractories business. The
supply of natural and synthetic magnesia is abundant worldwide. In 2000, the
Company purchased some of its magnesia requirements from various sources
located in China. While the Company does not expect an interruption in the
supply of magnesia from these sources, various factors associated with economic
and political uncertainty in China could result in future supply interruptions.


If such an interruption were to occur, the Company believes it could obtain
alternate supplies worldwide, although there could be no assurance that the
Company could do so at current prices. Alternatively, the Company believes it
could adjust its mix of products and/or increase production capacity at its
Manistee, Michigan plant.

The Company generally delivers its Magnesia Specialties division’s
products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers. Accordingly, there
is no significant backlog information. Inventory for the Magnesia Specialties
division’s products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet
rapid delivery requirements of customers. The Company has provided extended
payment terms to certain international customers.

Patents and Trademarks

As of March 16, 2001, the Company owns, has the right to use, or has
pending applications for approximately 100 patents pending or granted by the
United States and various countries and approximately 103 trademarks related to
its Magnesia Specialties business and its developing technologies and services
business. The Company expects to transfer 19 and 35 of those patents and
trademarks, respectively, to a subsidiary of Minerals Technologies in
connection with the proposed sale of the refractories business. The Company
believes that its rights under its existing patents, patent applications and
trademarks are of value to its operations, but no one patent or trademark or
group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the Company’s
business as a whole.

Customers

No material part of the business of either segment of the Company is
dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers, the loss of any one
of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment. The Company’s
products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry.
Although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works
projects, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state,
county or municipal governments, or agencies thereof.

Competition

Because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates business,
competition tends to be limited to producers in proximity to the Company’s
individual production facilities. Although all of the Company’s locations
experience competition, the Company believes that it is generally a leading
producer in the areas it serves. Competition is based primarily on quarry
location and price, but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are
also factors.

The Company is the second largest producer of aggregates in the United
States based on tons shipped. There are over 4,000 companies in the United
States that produce aggregates. The largest five producers account for
approximately 27% of the total market. The Company competes with a number of
other large and small producers. The Company believes that its ability to
transport materials by ocean vessels and river barges and its increased access
to rail transportation as a result of the Redland Stone, Meridian and other
transactions, has enhanced the Company’s ability to compete in


certain extended areas. Certain of the Company’s competitors in the aggregates
industry have greater financial resources than the Company.

The Magnesia Specialties division of the Company competes with various
companies in different geographic and product areas. The division competes
principally on the basis of quality, price and technical support for its
products. The Magnesia Specialties division also competes for sales to
customers located outside the United States with sales to such customers
accounting for approximately $20.4 million in net sales in 2000
(representing approximately 16% of net sales of the Magnesia Specialties
segment) principally in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany and Korea.
Approximately half of these sales are associated with the refractories business
which is proposed to be sold to a subsidiary of Minerals Technologies in the
second quarter 2001. The Magnesia Specialties division’s sales to foreign
customers were $21.0 million in 1999 and $20.5 million in 1998.

Research and Development

The Company conducts research and development activities for its Magnesia
Specialties segment at its laboratory located near Baltimore, Maryland and at
various locations for the new proprietary technologies. The Company expects to
discontinue conducting these activities at its Baltimore, Maryland laboratory
after the proposed sale of the refractories business to a subsidiary of
Minerals Technologies. In general, the Company’s research and development
efforts in 2000 were directed to applied technological development for the use
of its refractories and chemicals products and for its proprietary
technologies, including composite materials, a laser-measuring device and
microwave technology. The Company spent approximately $2.3 million in 2000,
$2.8 million in 1999 and $3.1 million in 1998 on research and development
activities.

Environmental Regulations

The Company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal, state and
local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and
other regulatory matters. Certain of the Company’s operations may from time to
time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous
substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations. Environmental
operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Company’s
operations and such permits are subject to modification, renewal and
revocation. The Company regularly monitors and reviews its operations,
procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations.
Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent
in the operation of the Company’s businesses, as it is with other companies
engaged in similar businesses, and there can be no assurance that environmental
liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the Company in the
future. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy for environmental
costs, amounts are not accrued and included in the Company’s financial
statements until it is probable that a liability has been incurred and such
amounts can be estimated reasonably. The environmental accruals are estimated
based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and generally not
discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other
claims. Costs incurred by the Company in connection with environmental matters
in the preceding two fiscal years were not material to the Company’s operations
or financial condition.


The Company believes that its operations and facilities, both owned or
leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and
that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s operations or financial condition. See “Legal Proceedings” on pages
13-14 of this Form 10-K and “Note L: Commitments and Contingencies” of the
“Notes to Financial Statements” on pages 22 and 23 and “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” on page 38 of
the 2000 Annual Report. However, future events, such as changes in or modified
interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or
further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain
products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and
other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

In general, quarry sites must comply with noise, water discharge and air
quality regulations, zoning and special use permitting requirements, applicable
mining regulations and federal health and safety requirements. As new quarry
sites are located and acquired, the Company works closely with local
authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries
in such a way as to minimize disturbances. The Company frequently acquires
large tracts of land so that quarry and production facilities can be situated
substantial distances from surrounding property owners. The Company maintains
a centralized blasting function for its quarry operations, and has established
policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners.

The Company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to
the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use. The
Company generally reclaims its quarries on an ongoing basis, reclaiming
mined-out areas of the quarry while continuing operations at other areas of the
site. Historically, the Company has not incurred extraordinary or substantial
costs in connection with the closing of quarries. Reclaimed quarry sites owned
by the Company are available for sale, typically for commercial development or
use as reservoirs.

As is the case with other companies in the same industry, some of the
Company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica, a common
mineral. Excessive, prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of
crystalline silica has been associated with nonmalignant lung disease. The
carcinogenic potential of crystalline silica was evaluated by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer and later by the U.S. National Toxicology
Program. In 1987, the agency found limited evidence of carcinogenicity in
humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. The National
Toxicology Program concluded in 1991 that crystalline silica is “reasonably
anticipated to be a carcinogen.” In October 1996, the International Agency for
Research on Cancer issued another report stating that “inhaled crystalline
silica in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational sources is
carcinogenic to humans.” The Mine Safety and Health Administration has
included the development of a crystalline silica standard as one of its
long-term goals. The Company, through safety information sheets and other
means, communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions to
employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive, prolonged
inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular.

The EPA in November 1996 proposed certain changes to the regulations
relating to the standard for particulate matter in connection with air quality,
which were recently placed into law as the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards. The new law places an ambient air limit on the emission of fine
particles (smaller than 2.5 microns) that typically result from industrial,
motor vehicle and power generation fuel combustion, in addition to the coarse
particles previously regulated. As adopted,


the regulations impact many industries, including the aggregates industry.
The National Stone Association (“NSA”) has joined a lawsuit with many other
industries challenging the standard and the lack of scientific data available
supporting the limits and the ability of industry to monitor the pollutant. In
May 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
overturned the EPA’s PM2.5 and ozone national ambient air quality standards.
The EPA appealed the Court of Appeals’ decision to the United States
Supreme Court, which decided on February 27, 2001 that the EPA
has the authority to issue air quality standards and remanded the
case for reexamination the standards proposed by the EPA. The Company
will not be able to determine the applicability of any new rules or
the costs associates with any required standards until an emission
standard is adopted. The Company believes that any such costs would
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations or its
financial condition.

As a result of the processing of dolomitic limestone at the Magnesia
Specialties division’s Woodville, Ohio, facility, lime kiln dust (“LKD”) is
produced as a by-product. The Company historically placed the LKD in the
quarry as part of reclamation required under its mining permit. The Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency (“OEPA”) promulgated regulations that apply to
the disposal of LKD and regulate it as a solid waste. The regulations require
the Company to change its disposal method and institute additional controls.
In order to comply with the regulations, the Company executed an administrative
order with the OEPA on November 24, 1997 requiring the Company to submit a
permit application for a landfill by May 1998, which was duly submitted. The
OEPA has not made a decision on the application. The Company, along with the
National Lime Association and other lime producers in Ohio, has been working
with the OEPA to develop a consensus approach to determine if changes to the
current scope of the regulations are appropriate and whether a landfill permit
is needed for the disposal. A draft bill was introduced to the State of Ohio
Senate in August 2000 proposing that LKD be regulated under the mining laws and
excluded as a solid waste thus eliminating the requirement for a landfill
permit. Depending upon the result of the proposed legislation and whether the
facility will require a landfill permit, the Company may be required to incur
certain compliance costs. The Company believes that any such costs would not
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial
condition but can give no assurance that the compliance costs will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the Magnesia
Specialties segment’s operations.

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require the EPA to develop
regulations for a broad spectrum of industrial sectors that emit hazardous air
pollutants, including lime manufacturing. The new standards to be established
would require plants to install feasible control equipment for certain
hazardous air pollutants, thereby significantly reducing air emissions. The
Company is actively participating with other lime manufacturers in working with
the EPA to define test protocols, better define the scope of the standards,
determine the existence and feasibility of various technologies, and develop
realistic emission limitations and continuous emissions monitoring/reporting
requirements for the lime industry. The EPA has conducted testing at lime
manufacturing facilities located in Alabama, Texas and Ohio, including the
Company’s Woodville facility, the results of which were discussed with the EPA
in 1999 to determine whether the facilities should be subject to these
regulations. The EPA received comments on its proposed technology-based
standards for the industry in November 2000; the EPA has not published any
final response or standards to date. The Company will not be able to determine
the applicability of the new regulations or the cost associated with any
required standards until the emission standards are adopted. The Company
believes that any costs associated with the upgrade and/or replacement of
equipment required to comply with the new regulations would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial condition but can
give no assurance that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition or results of the Magnesia Specialties
segment’s operations.


In February 1998, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (“GDNR”)
determined that both the Company and the Georgia Department of Transportation
(“GDOT”) are responsible parties for investigation and remediation at the
Company’s Camak Quarry in Thomson, Georgia, due to the discovery of
trichloroethene (“TCE”) above its naturally occurring background concentration
in a drinking water well on site. The Company provided the GDNR with
information indicating that the source of the release was either from an
asphalt plant that was on the site in the early 1970’s or from a maintenance
shop that was operated on the property in the 1940’s and 1950’s before the
Company purchased the property. The Company was designated a responsible party
by virtue of its ownership of the property. The Company entered into a Consent
Order with GDNR to conduct an environmental assessment of the site and file a
report of the findings. The Company and GDOT signed an agreement to share
evenly the costs of the assessment work. The assessment report was completed
and filed. Based upon the results of the assessment report, GDOT withdrew from
the cost sharing agreement and has indicated it will not share in any future
remediation costs. Georgia law provides that responsible parties are jointly
and severally liable and, therefore, the Company is potentially liable for the
full cost of funding the investigation and any necessary remediation. If the
Company is required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory
framework provides that the Company may pursue rights of contribution from the
other responsible parties. Management believes any costs incurred by the
Company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s operations or its financial condition.

In December 1998, the GDNR determined that the Company, the GDOT and two
other parties which operated an asphalt plant are responsible parties for
investigation and remediation at the Company’s Ruby Quarry in Macon, Georgia.
The Company was designated by virtue of its ownership of the property. GDOT
was designated because it caused a release of TCE above its naturally occurring
background concentration in the groundwater at the site. The two other parties
were designated because both entities operated the asphalt plant at the site.
The groundwater contamination was discovered when the Company’s tenant vacated
the premises and environmental testing was conducted. The Company and GDOT
signed an agreement to share the costs of the assessment work. The report of
the assessment work was filed with the GDNR. GDOT entered into a Consent Order
with GDNR agreeing to conduct additional testing and any necessary remediation
at the site. The Company has not signed a Consent Order, and GDNR may issue an
Administrative Order against the Company and other responsible parties to
require all parties to participate with GDOT to undertake additional testing
and any necessary remediation. If the Company is required to fund the cost of
remediation, the Company will pursue its right of contribution from the
responsible parties. Management believes any costs incurred by the Company
associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s operations or its financial condition.

Employees

As of March 16, 2001, the Company has approximately 6,000 employees.
Approximately 4,500 are hourly employees and approximately 1,500 are salaried
employees. Included among these employees are approximately 1,100 hourly
employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 19% of the Company’s
Aggregates division’s hourly employees are members of a labor union, while 96%
of the Magnesia Specialties division’s hourly employees are represented by
labor unions. The Company’s principal union contracts cover employees at the
Manistee, Michigan, magnesia-based products plant and the Woodville, Ohio, lime
plant. The current Manistee labor union contract was ratified in August 1999
and expires in 2003. The Woodville labor union contract was extended in June


2000 and expires in June 2001. The renewals of the Woodville labor union
contract in 1996 and 2000 were renegotiated without any disruption to normal
operations although there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will
be reached or that a work stoppage will not occur. The Company considers its
relations with its employees to be good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Aggregates

As of March 16, 2001, the Company processed or shipped aggregates from 289
quarries and distribution yards in 24 states in the southeast, southwest,
midwest and central United States and in Canada and the Bahamas, of which 82
are located on land owned by the Company free of major encumbrances, 58 are on
land owned in part and leased in part, 137 are on leased land, and 12 are on
facilities neither owned nor leased, where raw materials are removed under an
agreement. In addition, the Company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete
and/or asphalt products from 25 properties in 4 states in the southern United
States, of which 11 are located on land owned by the Company free of major
encumbrances, 2 are on land owned in part and leased in part and 12 are on
leased land.

Magnesia Specialties

The Magnesia Specialties division currently operates major manufacturing
facilities in Manistee, Michigan, and Woodville, Ohio, and smaller processing
plants in River Rouge, Michigan; Bridgeport, Connecticut; Baton Rouge,
Louisiana; Lenoir City, Tennessee; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. All of these
facilities are owned, except Pittsburgh and Lenoir City, which are leased. The
sale of the refractories business to a subsidiary of Minerals Technologies
contemplates that the processing plants in River Rouge and Baton Rouge would be
transferred to the subsidiary of Minerals Technologies. In addition, the
Company has entered into several third-party toll-manufacturing agreements
pursuant to which it processes various chemical and refractory products, some
of which will be transferred to the subsidiary of Minerals Technologies in
connection with the proposed sale of the refractories business.

Other Properties

The Company’s corporate headquarters, which it owns, is located in
Raleigh, North Carolina. The Company owns and leases various administrative
offices and research and development laboratories for its Aggregates division
and its Magnesia Specialties division.

The Company’s principal properties, which are of varying ages and are of
different construction types, are believed to be generally in good condition,
are well maintained, and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes
for which they are used. The principal properties are believed to be utilized
at average productive capacities of approximately 80% and are capable of
supporting a higher level of market demand.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time claims of various types are asserted against the Company
arising out of its operations in the normal course of business, including
claims relating to land use and permits, safety,


health and environmental matters (such as noise abatement, vibrations, air
emissions and water discharges). Such matters are subject to many
uncertainties and it is not possible to determine the probable outcome of, or
the amount of liability, if any, from these matters. In the opinion of
management of the Company (which opinion is based in part upon consideration of
the opinion of counsel), it is unlikely that the outcome of these claims will
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial
condition. However, there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in any
of such litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the Company or
its operating segments.

Financial Statements” on pages 22 and 23 of the 2000 Annual Report and

Operations” on page 38 of the 2000 Annual Report.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of 2000.
