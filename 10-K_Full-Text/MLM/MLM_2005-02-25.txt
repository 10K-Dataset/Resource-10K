ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the “Company”) is the United States’ second largest producer
of aggregates for the construction industry, including highways, infrastructure, commercial, and
residential. The Company also manufactures and markets magnesia-based chemical products used in
industrial, agricultural, and environmental applications, and dolomitic lime sold primarily to the
steel industry, and is developing structural composite products for use in a wide variety of
industries. In 2004, the Company’s aggregates segment accounted for 93% of the Company’s total net
sales, and the Company’s specialty products segment accounted for 7% of the Company’s total net
sales.

The Company was formed in 1993 as a North Carolina corporation to succeed to the operations of
the materials group of the organization that is now Lockheed Martin Corporation. An initial public
offering of a portion of the Company’s Common Stock was completed in 1994, followed by a
transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100% of the Company’s Common Stock being publicly traded.

Initially the Company’s operations were predominantly in the Southeast with additional
operations in the Midwest. In 1995, the Company started its geographic expansion with the purchase
of a significant aggregates business, which included an extensive waterborne distribution system
along the East and Gulf Coasts and the Mississippi River. Smaller acquisitions that year,
including acquisition of the Company’s granite operations on the Strait of Canso in Nova Scotia,
complemented the Company’s new coastal distribution network.

Another significant acquisition in 1997 expanded the Company’s aggregates business in the
middle of the country, while another significant acquisition in 1998 added the leading producer of
aggregates products in Texas and provided the Company with an extensive rail network in Texas.
These two transactions set the stage for numerous additional expansion acquisitions in Ohio and
Indiana, the Southeast, and the Southwest, with the Company completing 29 smaller acquisitions
between 1997 and 1999, which allowed the Company to enhance and expand its presence in the
aggregates marketplace. In 1998, the Company also made its initial investment, as described below,
in a business that would later serve as the Company’s platform for further expansion in the
southwestern and western United States.

In October 1998, the Company purchased an initial 14% interest in the business of Meridian
Aggregates Company (“Meridian”). In April 2001, the Company completed the purchase of all of the
remaining interests of Meridian under the purchase option terms of the original investment
agreement. The purchase consideration consisted of $238 million, including the original October
1998 investment of $42 million, the retirement of debt, the forgiveness of related party
obligations, and estimated amounts for certain other assumed liabilities and transaction costs,
plus the assumption of normal balance sheet liabilities (the “Meridian Acquisition”). At the time
of the Meridian transaction, Meridian operated 25 aggregates production facilities and seven
rail-served distribution yards in 11



states in the southwestern and western United States and sold aggregates to customers in 14 states,
including six states in which the Company had not previously conducted any business. The Meridian
Acquisition added more than 1.6 billion tons of aggregates reserves, expanded the Company’s
presence in the southwest and western states, and increased its ability to use rail as a mode of
transportation.

In December 2004, the Company announced the formation of a joint venture with Hunt Midwest
Enterprises, effective January 1, 2005, to operate substantially all of the aggregates facilities
of both companies in Kansas City and surrounding areas. The joint venture was formed by the
parties contributing a total of 15 active quarry operations with production of approximately 7.5
million tons annually.

In 2002, the Company completed a number of sales of nonstrategic operations in its Aggregates
division, including the sale of facilities in Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and
Virginia. In 2003, the Company continued these sales of nonstrategic operations, including the
sale of facilities in Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Texas, and West Virginia. In 2004 the
Company divested nonstrategic aggregate facilities in Alabama, California, Tennessee, and
Washington, as well as certain facilities involved with its asphalt, ready mixed concrete, and road
paving operations in Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma. In some of these transactions, the Company
concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide aggregates at market rates to certain of
these businesses. The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest nonstrategic
assets during 2005 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities.

In May 2001, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Martin Marietta Magnesia
Specialties (“Magnesia Specialties”), sold certain assets related to the refractories portion of
its Magnesia Specialties business to a subsidiary of Minerals Technologies Inc. for $34 million.
The Company retained certain current assets (including accounts receivable) and certain liabilities
relating to the refractories business. In an accompanying manufacturing agreement, Magnesia
Specialties agreed to supply the subsidiary of Minerals Technologies with certain refractories
products at market rates principally from the Manistee, Michigan plant of Magnesia Specialties for
a period of time following the sale. This agreement ended in 2002. The sale of Magnesia
Specialties’ refractories business lessened the dependence of the Magnesia Specialties business on
the steel industry. In addition, in 2003 the Magnesia Specialties business also disposed of two of
its nonstrategic lines of business.

In 2003, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Martin Marietta Composites, Inc.
(“Martin Marietta Composites”), opened for business a 185,000 square foot facility in Sparta, North
Carolina, which serves as the assembly and manufacturing hub for its structural composite products
(“Structural Composite Products”) business.



Business Segment Information

The Company operates in two reportable business segments: Aggregates and Specialty Products.
The Specialty Products segment includes the Magnesia Specialties business and the Structural
Composite Products business. Information concerning the Company’s total revenues, net sales,
earnings from operations, assets employed, and certain additional information attributable to each
reportable industry segment for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004 is
included in “Note O: Business Segments” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” on pages 32 and 33
of the Company’s 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders (the “2004 Annual Report”), which information
is incorporated herein by reference.

Aggregates

The Company’s Aggregates division processes and sells granite, limestone, sand, gravel, and
other aggregates products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure, commercial, and
residential construction industries. The Aggregates division also includes the operation of its
other construction materials businesses. These businesses, acquired through continued selective
vertical integration by the Company, include primarily asphalt, ready mix concrete, and road paving
operations.

The Company is the United States’ second largest producer of aggregates. In 2004, the
Company’s Aggregates division shipped 191.5 million tons of aggregates primarily to customers in 32
states, Canada, and the Bahamas, generating net sales and earnings from operations of $1.4 billion
and $220 million, respectively.

The Aggregates division markets its products primarily to the construction industry, with
approximately 46% of its shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public
infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in
connection with commercial and residential construction projects. As a result of dependence upon
the construction industry, the profitability of aggregates producers is sensitive to national,
regional, and local economic conditions, and particularly to cyclical swings in construction
spending, which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates, and demographic and population
shifts and to changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector. The
Company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area. The Company’s aggregates, asphalt
products, and ready mixed concrete are sold and shipped from a network of approximately 325
quarries, distribution facilities, and plants in 28 states, Canada, and the Bahamas, although the
Company’s five largest revenue-generating states (Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, and
Indiana) account for approximately 57% of total net sales by state of destination. The Company’s
business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected
in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies.

The Company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal, due primarily to the effect of
weather conditions on construction activity within its markets. As the Company has expanded, its
exposure to winter weather-related risks has increased. The Aggregates division’s operations that
are concentrated in the northern region of the United States and Canada experience more severe
winter weather conditions than the division’s operations in the Southeast and Southwest. Due to
these factors, the Company’s second and third quarters are the strongest, with the first quarter
generally reflecting



the weakest results. Results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the Company’s annual
results. Similarly, the division’s operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the
United States and the Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity and have experienced
weather-related losses in recent years, which have had a significant adverse impact on the
financial performance of the Company. During 2004, aggregates shipments in the Company’s
southeastern and Gulf Coast markets were adversely affected by four hurricanes. The Company’s
Bahamas facility took two direct hits from hurricanes with limited physical damage. However, power
was not restored at the facility for five weeks after the storms, resulting in no production and
limited shipments during that time.

Aggregates can be found in abundant quantities throughout the United States, and there are
many producers nationwide. However, as a general rule, shipments from an individual quarry are
limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to
the value of the product itself. As a result, proximity of quarry facilities to customers is the
most important factor in competition for aggregates business and helps explain the highly
fragmented nature of the aggregates industry. As described below, the Company’s distribution
system mainly uses trucks, but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network, where the
per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower. In addition, acquisitions have
enabled the Company to extend its reach through increased access to rail transportation.

A growing percentage of the Company’s aggregates shipments are being moved by rail or water
through a distribution yard network. In 1994, 93% of the Company’s aggregates shipments were moved
by truck, while the balance of 7% was moved by rail. In contrast, the Company’s aggregates
shipments were moved 79% by truck, 11% by rail, and 10% by water in 2004. The Company has an
extensive network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the Mississippi River
system throughout the central and southern United States and in the Bahamas and Canada, as well as
distribution centers along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. The Gulf and Atlantic coastal
areas are being supplied in part from the Bahamas location, two large quarries on the Ohio River
system, and a Canadian quarry on the Strait of Canso in Nova Scotia. In addition, the Company’s
acquisitions have expanded its ability to ship by rail. Accordingly, in addition to increasing the
Company’s geographic presence through acquisitions, the Company has also enhanced its reach through
its ability to provide cost-effective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts, as
well as additional geographic areas which can be accessed economically by the Company’s expanded
distribution system. In 2002, the Company completed a major project to modernize and expand the
plant capacity at its Bahamas location, which provides the opportunity for the Company to capture
future potential market growth and reduce costs (although there can be no assurance of such growth
and cost reductions).

As the Company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water, embedded freight costs
have consequently reduced gross margins. This typically occurs where the Company transports
aggregates from a production location to a distribution location by rail or water, and the customer
pays a selling price that includes a freight component. Margins are negatively affected because
the customer typically does not pay the Company a profit associated with the transportation
component of the selling price. Moreover, the Company’s expansion of its rail-based distribution
network, coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the Southwest and Southeast, increases
the Company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance, including track congestion, crew
availability, and power availability, and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping
contracts.



During 2004, the Company experienced significant rail transportation shortages in Texas and
parts of the Southeast. These shortages resulted from the downsizing in personnel and equipment
made by certain railroads. Management is reviewing alternatives to address these issues. In
response to these issues, rail transportation providers have focused on increasing the volume of
cars related to transportation contracts and are generally enticing customers, through the freight
rate structure, to accommodate unit train unloadings. Certain of the Company’s sales yards in the
Southwest have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirement.

The waterborne distribution network increases the Company’s exposure to certain risks,
including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts, demurrage costs, fuel costs, barge
or ship availability, and weather disruptions. In 2004, the Company signed long-term agreements
that provide additional dedicated shipping capacity from the Company’s Bahamas and Nova Scotia
operations to its coastal ports.

The Company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed
with various rail carriers and via deepwater ships should provide the Company with the flexibility
to effectively serve customers in the Southwest and Southeast.

The Company’s management believes the overall long-term trend for the construction aggregates
industry continues to be one of consolidation, although the consolidation trend is slowing as the
number of suitable acquisition targets shrinks. The Company’s Board of Directors and management
continue to review and monitor the Company’s strategic long-term plans, which include assessing
business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses,
increased market share in the Company’s core businesses, and pursuing new technological
opportunities related to the Company’s existing markets.

Prior to 1998, the Company had historically focused on the production of aggregates and had
not integrated vertically in a substantial manner into other construction materials businesses.
The Company became significantly more vertically integrated with a significant acquisition in 1998
and subsequent acquisitions, particularly in the Southwest, pursuant to which the Company acquired
asphaltic concrete, ready mixed concrete, paving construction, trucking, and other businesses,
which establish vertical integration that complement the Company’s aggregates business. These
vertically integrated operations accounted for about 8% of revenues in 2004. If the Company were
to continue its expansion strategy westward, where vertically integrated operations are the norm,
profit margins generally would be adversely affected. Generally these operations have lower gross
margins than aggregates products, and are affected by volatile factors, including fuel costs,
operating efficiencies, and weather, to an even greater extent than the Company’s aggregates
operations. The road paving and trucking businesses have been acquired as supplemental operations
that were part of larger acquisitions. As such they do not represent core businesses of the
Company. These operations have typically resulted in losses that are insignificant to the Company
as a whole. In 2004 the Company continued disposing of some of these operations. The Company
continues to review carefully these operations to determine if they represent opportunities to
divest nonstrategic assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities.



Environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates
industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations. Although it cannot be
predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal, state, and local governmental
bodies regarding these matters, the Company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make
zoning and permitting more difficult, thereby potentially enhancing the value of the Company’s
existing mineral reserves.

Management believes the Aggregates division’s raw materials, or aggregates reserves, are
sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future. The
Company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for
current production in its aggregates segment. The Company’s aggregates reserves on the average
exceed 50 years of production, based on current levels of activity. However, certain locations may
be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand. Moreover, as noted above,
environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the Company to expand its
existing quarries or develop new quarry operations.

The Company uses various drilling methods, depending on the type of aggregate, to estimate
reserves that are economically mineable. The extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the
location is a potential new site (greensite), an existing location, or a potential acquisition.
More extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions, and in rare cases
the Company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties.
Subsequent to drilling, selected core samples are tested for soundness, abrasion resistance, and
other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry. If the reserves meet the Company’s
standards and are economically mineable, then they are either leased or purchased.

The Company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling. Proven
reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data, and based on that
data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous. Proven reserves have a certainty of
85% to 90%. Probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes and/or
assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from
adjacent properties. The degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70% to 75%. In determining
the amount of reserves, the Company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain
depths, so for deposits, such as granite, that typically continue to depths well below the ground,
there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculation. The Company
also deducts loss factors, such as property boundaries and plant configurations, as deemed
appropriate when estimating reserves. For additional information on the Company’s assessment of
reserves, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Application of Critical Accounting Policies — Property, Plant and Equipment” on pages
58-60 of the 2004 Annual Report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the Company.

The Company generally delivers products in its Aggregates segment upon receipt of orders or
requests from customers. Accordingly, there is no significant backlog information. Inventory of
aggregates is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of
customers.



Less than 1% of the Aggregates division’s revenues are from foreign jurisdictions, principally
Canada and the Bahamas, with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling $15.4 million,
$14.6 million, and $10.0 million, during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Specialty Products

The Company’s Specialty Products division consists of the Magnesia Specialties business and
the Structural Composite Products business.

Magnesia Specialties Business

. The Company in 2004 also manufactured and marketed, through
Magnesia Specialties, dolomitic lime and magnesia-based chemicals products for industrial,
agricultural, and environmental uses. Given the high fixed costs associated with the operations of
this business, excess capacity negatively affects its results of operations. A significant portion
of the costs related to the production of dolomitic lime and magnesia-based products is of a fixed
or semi-fixed nature. In addition, the production of dolomitic lime and certain magnesia-based
products requires the use of natural gas, coal, and petroleum coke to fuel kilns. Year-over-year
increases in natural gas and other fuel prices directly affect operating results.

Magnesia Specialties’ dolomitic lime products are sold primarily to the steel industry.
Accordingly, the profitability of the Magnesia Specialties business is dependent on the production
of steel and the related marketplace. Magnesia Specialties’ products used in the steel industry
accounted for approximately 48% of the revenues of the business in 2004, attributable primarily to
the sale of dolomitic lime products. However, Magnesia Specialties’ management has shifted the
strategic focus of its magnesia-based business to higher margin specialty chemicals that can be
produced at volume levels that support efficient operations. Moreover, in 2004 the chemicals group
portion of the Magnesia Specialties business continued to diversify in chemicals used as flame
retardants, in wastewater treatment, in pulp and paper production, and in other environmental
applications, and that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime
portion of the Magnesia Specialties business.

The principal raw materials used in Magnesia Specialties’ products are dolomitic limestone and
brine. Management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to
permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future.

Historically, after the brine is used in the production process, the Magnesia Specialties
business must dispose of the processed brine. Typically the business did this by reinjecting the
processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in Manistee,
Michigan. The business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to third parties. In 2003
Magnesia Specialties entered into a long-term processed brine supply agreement with The Dow
Chemical Company (“Dow”) pursuant to which Dow purchases processed brine from Magnesia Specialties,
at market rates, for use in Dow’s production of calcium chloride products. Magnesia Specialties
also entered into a venture with Dow to construct, own, and operate a processed brine supply
pipeline between the Magnesia Specialties facility in Manistee, Michigan, and Dow’s facility in
Ludington, Michigan. Construction of such pipeline was completed in 2003, and Dow began purchasing
processed brine from Magnesia Specialties through the pipeline.



The supply of natural and synthetic magnesia is abundant worldwide. In 2004, Magnesia
Specialties purchased some of its magnesia requirements from various sources located in China.
While Magnesia Specialties does not expect an interruption in the supply of magnesia from these
sources, various factors associated with economic and political uncertainty in China could result
in future supply interruptions. If such an interruption were to occur, Magnesia Specialties
believes it could obtain alternate supplies worldwide, although there could be no assurance that
Magnesia Specialties could do so at current prices. Alternatively, Magnesia Specialties believes
it could adjust its mix of products and/or increase production at its Manistee, Michigan plant.

Magnesia Specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from
customers. Accordingly, there is no significant backlog information. Inventory for the Magnesia
Specialties products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery
requirements of customers.

Approximately 14% of the revenues of the Magnesia Specialties business are from foreign
jurisdictions, principally Canada, Mexico, Europe, South America, and the Pacific Rim, but no
single country accounts for 10% or more of the revenues of the business. Revenues from customers
in foreign countries totaled $16.1 million, $12.5 million, and $10.3 million during 2004, 2003, and
2002, respectively. As a result of these foreign revenues, the financial results of the Magnesia
Specialties business could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak
economic conditions in the foreign markets. To mitigate the short-term effects of changes in
currency exchange rates, the Magnesia Specialties business principally uses the U.S. dollar as the
functional currency in foreign transactions.

Structural Composite Products Business

. The Company in 2004 also manufactured and marketed,
through Martin Marietta Composites (“MMC”), structural composite products for use in a wide variety
of industries. Pursuant to various agreements, MMC has rights to commercialize certain proprietary
technologies related to the Company’s business. One of the agreements gives MMC the opportunity to
pursue the use of certain fiber-reinforced polymer composites technologies for products where
corrosion resistance and high strength-to-weight ratios are important factors, such as bridge
decks, marine applications, and other structures and applications. MMC continued its research and
product development activities during 2004 on these structural composites technologies and
initiated or continued manufacturing and marketing of selected products. Since 2002, MMC has
leased a 185,000 square foot facility in Sparta, North Carolina, which serves as the assembly and
manufacturing hub for the Structural Composite Products business of MMC.

MMC is targeting several industries and the military for its fiber-reinforced polymer
composite materials: infrastructure, which includes pedestrian and vehicular bridge decks;
transportation, which includes specialty truck trailers and chassis, railcar components, and
tractor and trailer components; and construction, which includes wall panels, temporary structures,
and industrial mats. In 2004, MMC announced the installation of bridge decks in 2 states, bringing
its total to 27 bridge deck installations in 13 states and 2 foreign countries utilizing these
composite materials technologies. MMC continued to explore opportunities to introduce its
composite bridge installations to foreign markets. MMC has rights under a licensing agreement
executed in 2001 regarding the manufacturing



and marketing of commercial specialty truck trailers in North America, utilizing fiber-reinforced
composite materials. In 2002, MMC signed a licensing agreement relating to a proprietary composite
sandwich technology, which MMC expects will play an important role in the product line related to
flat panel applications. The first composite trailer prototype manufactured by MMC was completed
in 2003 and further developed in 2004.

MMC intends to continue to ramp up its Structural Composite Products business during 2005.
Product trials and commercialization continue to be the near-term focus of MMC. However, MMC is
approximately six months behind plan in commercialization of its Structural Composites Products
business. Improved performance in 2005 is essential to continued investment in this business. MMC
will continue to evaluate a variety of construction-related and commercial uses for composite
materials, in addition to its use in bridge decks and truck trailers. While MMC expects to
increase its revenues related to its Structural Composite Products business over the next five
years, there can be no assurance that these technologies will become profitable.

Patents and Trademarks

As of February 18, 2005, the Company owns, has the right to use, or has pending applications
for approximately 80 patents pending or granted by the United States and various countries and
approximately 62 trademarks related to business. The Company believes that its rights under its
existing patents, patent applications, and trademarks are of value to its operations, but no one
patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the Company’s
business as a whole.

Customers

No material part of the business of either segment of the Company is dependent upon a single
customer or upon a few customers, the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect
on the segment. The Company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private
industry. Although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects,
relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county, or municipal
governments, or agencies thereof.

Competition

Because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates business, competition in the
Aggregates division tends to be limited to producers in proximity to the Company’s individual
production facilities. Although all of the Company’s locations experience competition, the Company
believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves. Competition is based
primarily on quarry location and price, but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are
also factors.

The Company is the second largest producer of aggregates in the United States based on tons
shipped. There are over 4,000 companies in the United States that produce aggregates. The largest
five producers account for approximately 26% of the total market. The Company in its Aggregates
division competes with a number of other large and small producers. The Company believes that its



ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and river barges and its increased access to rail
transportation have enhanced the Company’s ability to compete in certain extended areas. Certain
of the Company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the
Company.

The Magnesia Specialties business of the Company’s Specialty Products division competes with
various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality,
price, and technical support for its products. The Magnesia Specialties business also competes for
sales to customers located outside the United States, with revenues from foreign jurisdictions
accounting for approximately 14% of revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business in 2004,
principally in Canada, Mexico, Europe, South America, and the Pacific Rim. Certain of the
Company’s competitors in the Magnesia Specialties business have greater financial resources than
the Company.

The Structural Composite Products business of the Company’s Specialty Products division is a
relatively new business that competes or will compete with various companies in different
geographic and product areas principally on the basis of technological advances, quality, price,
and technical support. The Structural Composite Products business competes or will compete for
sales to customers located outside the United States. Certain of the Company’s competitors in the
Structural Composite Products business have greater financial resources than the Company.

Research and Development

The Company conducts research and development activities principally for its Magnesia
Specialties business, at its plant in Manistee, Michigan, and for its Structural Composite Products
business, at its headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, and its plant in Sparta, North Carolina.
In general, the Company’s research and development efforts in 2004 were directed to applied
technological development for the use of its chemicals products and for its proprietary
technologies, including composite materials. The Company spent approximately $0.9 million in 2004,
$0.6 million in 2003, and $0.4 million in 2002 on research and development activities.

Environmental and Governmental Regulations

The Company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, and local laws and
regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, and other regulatory matters. Certain
of the Company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified
as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations. Environmental
operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Company’s operations, and such
permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation.

The Company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in
which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably
estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change.
The accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other
claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site.



The Company regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures, and policies for
compliance with existing laws and regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws and
enforcement policies, new laws that are adopted, and new laws that the Company anticipates will be
adopted that could affect its operations. The Company has a full time staff of environmental
engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities. The direct costs of ongoing
environmental compliance were $5.3 million in 2004 and $5.7 million in 2003 and are related to the
Company’s environmental staff and ongoing monitoring costs for various matters (including those
matters disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Capitalized costs related to environmental
control facilities were less than $1 million in 2004. The Company’s capital expenditures for
environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2004
or 2003. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the
operation of the Company’s businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses,
and there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company in the future.

Many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the
Company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations. For example,
plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may, as an ordinary course of operations,
have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone. The water spray bar also
suffices as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws. The Company
does not break out the portion of the cost, depreciation, and other financial information relating
to the water spray bar that is only attributable to environmental purposes, as it would be derived
from an arbitrary allocation methodology. The incremental portion of such operating costs that is
attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to
quantify. Accordingly, the Company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating
expenses.

The environmental accruals recorded by the Company are based on internal studies of the
required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under
federal, state, and/or local environmental protection laws. Many of these laws and the regulations
promulgated under them are complex, and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by
regulators and the courts from time to time. In addition, new laws are adopted from time to time.
It is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it
is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be
implemented is more accurately defined. This process often takes years to finalize and changes
significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final. The Company
typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements, which
could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with
equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and
carry significantly higher costs.

Management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable, although
those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are
finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances. The Company believes that any
additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s obligations or financial condition.



With respect to reclamation costs, however, effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(“FAS 143”)

.

See “Note N: Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements”
on pages 31 and 32 of the 2004 Annual Report. Under FAS 143, future reclamation costs are
estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the
industry, and are discounted to their present value using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate of
interest. The future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries. The Company is
generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to
reclaim quarry sites after use. The Company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may
reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation. These activities are performed as an integral part of
the normal quarrying process. For example, the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry
are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization. This
sloping and benching meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the Mine Safety and
Health Administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements. Therefore, these
types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset
retirement obligation. Historically, the Company has not incurred substantial costs in connection
with the closing of quarries. Reclaimed quarry sites owned by the Company are available for sale,
typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs.

The Company believes that its operations and facilities, both owned or leased, are in
substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not
likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or financial condition. See
“Legal Proceedings” on pages 21 and 22 of this Form 10-K and “Note N: Commitments and
Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” on pages 31 and 32 and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Environmental Regulation
and Litigation” on page 50 of the 2004 Annual Report. However, future events, such as changes in
or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or further
investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business
activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

In general, quarry sites must comply with air quality, water quality, and noise regulations,

zoning and special use permitting requirements, applicable mining regulations, and federal health
and safety requirements. As new quarry sites are located and acquired, the Company works closely
with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries in such a
way as to minimize disturbances. The Company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that
quarry and production facilities can be situated substantial distances from surrounding property
owners. Also, the Company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its
facilities further away from residential areas. The Company has established policies designed to
minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations.

As is the case with other companies in the same industry, some of the Company’s products
contain varying amounts of crystalline silica, a mineral commonly called quartz. Excessive,
prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with
nonmalignant lung disease. The carcinogenic potential of crystalline silica was evaluated by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer and later by the U.S. National Toxicology Program. In
1987, the agency found



limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in
animals. The National Toxicology Program concluded in 1991 that crystalline silica is “reasonably
anticipated to be a carcinogen.” In October 1996, the International Agency for Research on Cancer
issued another report stating that “inhaled crystalline silica in the form of quartz or
cristobalite from occupational sources is carcinogenic to humans.” The Mine Safety and Health
Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration both have listed the
development of a crystalline silica standard as one of the regulations they expect to have under
active consideration for promulgation, proposal, or review during 2004. The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration has identified occupational overexposure to crystalline silica among its
top five health priorities and developed a draft regulation in 2003. The Mine Safety and Health
Administration (MSHA) did not issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for the development of
a crystalline silica standard in May 2004 as had been previously announced. The issue is in the
prerule status, and MSHA is preparing a detailed risk assessment and plans to complete an external
peer review of a draft assessment by February 2005. The Company, through safety information sheets
and other means, communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees
and customers about the risks associated with excessive, prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in
general and crystalline silica in particular.

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required the EPA to develop regulations for a broad
spectrum of industrial sectors that emit hazardous air pollutants, including lime manufacturing.
The new standards to be established would require plants in the targeted industries to install
feasible control equipment for certain hazardous air pollutants, thereby significantly reducing air
emissions. The Company and other lime manufacturers through the National Lime Association, the
leading industry trade association (“NLA”), worked with the EPA to define test protocols, better
define the scope of the standards, determine the existence and feasibility of various technologies,
and develop realistic emission limitations and continuous emissions monitoring/reporting
requirements for the lime industry. The EPA received comments on its proposed technology-based
standards for the industry in November 2000, and a proposed rule for the national emission
standards for lime manufacturing plants was released on December 20, 2002. The proposed rules
favorably addressed many of the issues raised by NLA in the negotiation process. NLA and the
Company submitted comments on the proposed rules in February 2003. The EPA published the final
rule in the Federal Register on January 5, 2004, and facilities must be in compliance within three
years after the date of publication. The Company believes that there are several alternatives for
achieving compliance with the new technology-based standard, and that any costs associated with the
upgrade and/or replacement of equipment required to comply with the new regulations will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial condition, but can give no
assurance that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or results of the operations of the Magnesia Specialties business.

In February 1998, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (“GDNR”) determined that both
the Company and the Georgia Department of Transportation (“GDOT”) are responsible parties for
investigation and remediation at the Company’s Camak Quarry in Thomson, Georgia, due to the
discovery of trichloroethene (“TCE”) above its naturally occurring background concentration in a
drinking water well on site. The Company provided the GDNR with information indicating that the
source of the release was either from an asphalt plant and associated GDOT testing laboratory that
was on the site in the early 1970’s or from a maintenance shop that was operated on the property in
the



1940’s and 1950’s before the Company purchased the property. The Company entered into a Consent
Order with GDNR to conduct an environmental assessment of the site and file a report of the
findings. The Company and GDOT signed an agreement to share evenly the costs of the assessment
work. The assessment report was completed and filed. Based upon the results of the assessment
report, GDOT withdrew from the cost sharing agreement and has indicated it will not share in any
future remediation costs. The Company submitted a corrective action plan to GDNR for approval on
December 9, 2002. GDNR requested additional information which was duly submitted. The Company is
waiting for GDNR to approve the plan before implementing it. The Company is funding the entire
cost of future investigations and remediation which will occur over several years. Management
believes any costs incurred by the Company associated with the site will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial condition.

In December 1998, the GDNR determined that the Company, the GDOT, and two former asphalt plant
operators are responsible parties for investigation and remediation of groundwater contamination at
the Company’s Ruby Quarry in Macon, Georgia. The Company was designated by virtue of its ownership
of the property. GDOT was designated because it operated a testing laboratory at the site. The
two other parties were designated because both entities operated asphalt plants at the site. The
groundwater contamination was discovered when the Company’s tenant vacated the premises and
environmental testing was conducted. The Company and GDOT signed an agreement to share the costs
of the assessment work. The report of the assessment work was filed with the GDNR. GDOT entered
into a Consent Order with GDNR agreeing to conduct additional testing and any necessary remediation
at the site. On May 21, 2001, GDNR issued separate Administrative Orders against the Company and
other responsible parties to require all parties to participate with GDOT to undertake additional
testing and any necessary remediation. The Company and GDOT submitted a corrective action plan to
GDNR for approval on May 20, 2002. GDNR requested additional information in connection with its
consideration of the submitted plan and subsequently approved the plan on July 19, 2004. GDOT is
filing an amendment to the plan, and once the amendment is approved by GDNR, it is expected that
GDOT will develop a schedule to implement the plan. Under Georgia law, responsible parties are
jointly and severally liable, and therefore, the Company is potentially liable for the full cost of
funding any necessary remediation. If the Company is required to fund the cost of remediation, the
Company will pursue its right of contribution from the responsible parties. Management believes
any costs incurred by the Company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s operations or its financial condition.

In the vicinity of and beneath the Magnesia Specialties facility in Manistee, Michigan,
facility, there is an underground plume of material originating from adjacent property which
formerly was used by Packaging Corporation of America (“PCA”) as a part of its operations.
Magnesia Specialties believes the plume consists of paper mill waste. On September 8, 1983, the
PCA plume and property were listed on the National Priorities List (“NPL”) under the authority of
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “Superfund” statute).
The PCA plume is subject to a Record of Decision issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) on May 2, 1994, pursuant to which PCA’s successor, Pactiv Corporation (“Pactiv”), is
required to conduct annual monitoring. The EPA has not required remediation of the groundwater
contamination. On January 10, 2002, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”)
issued Notice of Demand letters to Magnesia Specialties, PCA and Pactiv indicating that it believes
that Magnesia



Specialties’ chloride contamination is commingling with the PCA plume which originates
upgradient from the Magnesia Specialties property. The MDEQ is concerned about possible effects of
these plumes, and designated Magnesia Specialties, PCA and Pactiv as parties responsible for
investigation and remediation under Michigan state law. The MDEQ held separate meetings with
Magnesia Specialties, PCA, and Pactiv to discuss remediation and reimbursement for past
investigation costs totaling approximately $700,000. Magnesia Specialties entered into an
Administrative Order with the MDEQ to pay for a portion of MDEQ’s past investigation costs and
thereby limit its liability for past costs in the amount of $20,000. Michigan law provides that
responsible parties are jointly and severally liable, and, therefore, Magnesia Specialties is
potentially liable for the full cost of funding future investigative activities and any necessary
remediation. Michigan law also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among
responsible parties if it is capable of division. The Company believes that the liability most
likely will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to Magnesia Specialties’ brine
contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial
condition, but can give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance
costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the
operations of the Magnesia Specialties business.

Employees

As of February 18, 2005, the Company has approximately 5,778 employees. Approximately 4,326
are hourly employees and approximately 1,452 are salaried employees. Included among these
employees are approximately 837 hourly employees represented by labor unions (approximately 14% of
the Company’s employees). Approximately 18% of the Company’s Aggregates division’s hourly
employees are members of a labor union, while approximately 98% of the Specialty Products
division’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions. The Company’s principal union
contracts cover employees of the Magnesia Specialties business at the Manistee, Michigan,
magnesia-based chemicals plant and the Woodville, Ohio, lime plant. The Manistee collective
bargaining agreement expires in August 2007. The Woodville collective bargaining agreement expires
in June 2006.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Aggregates

As of December 31, 2004, the Company processed or shipped aggregates from 308 quarries and
distribution yards in 28 states and in Canada and the Bahamas, of which 86 are located on land
owned by the Company free of major encumbrances, 73 are on land owned in part and leased in part,
138 are on leased land, and 11 are on facilities neither owned nor leased, where raw materials are
removed under an agreement. The Company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 50 years of
production, based on current levels of activity. However, certain locations may be subject to more
limited reserves and may not be able to expand. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, the Company
processed and shipped ready mixed concrete and/or asphalt products from 17 properties in 3 states,
of which 9 are located on land owned by the Company free of major encumbrances, 1 is on land owned
in part and leased in part, and 7 are on leased land.

Set forth in the tables below are the Company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable
aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction, shown on a state-by-state basis, and the
Company’s total annual production for the last 3 years, along with the Company’s estimate of years
of production



available, shown on a region-by-region basis. In determining the amount of reserves, the Company’s
policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths, so for deposits, such as granite,
that typically continue to depths well below the ground, there may be additional deposits that are
not included in the reserves calculations.

Specialty Products

The Magnesia Specialties business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in
Manistee, Michigan, and Woodville, Ohio, and smaller processing plants in Bridgeport, Connecticut,
and Lenoir City, Tennessee. All of these facilities are owned, except Lenoir City, which is
leased.

The Structural Composite Products business leases a 185,000 square foot facility in Sparta,
North Carolina, which serves as the assembly and manufacturing hub for the Structural Composite
Products business of Martin Marietta Composites.

Other Properties

The Company’s principal corporate office, which it owns, is located in Raleigh, North
Carolina. The Company owns and leases various administrative offices for its two reportable
business segments.

The Company’s principal properties, which are of varying ages and are of different
construction types, are believed to be generally in good condition, are generally well maintained,
and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used. During 2004, the
principal properties were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately
80% and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time claims of various types are asserted against the Company arising out of its
operations in the normal course of business, including claims relating to land use and permits,
safety, health, and environmental matters (such as noise abatement, vibrations, air emissions, and
water discharges). Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and it is not possible to
determine the probable outcome of, or the amount of liability, if any, from, these matters. In the
opinion of management of the Company (which opinion is based in part upon consideration of the
opinion of counsel), it is unlikely that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s operations or its financial condition. However, there can be no assurance
that an adverse



outcome in any of such litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the Company or its
operating segments.

See also “Note N: Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” on
pages 31 and 32 of the 2004 Annual Report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Environmental Regulation and Litigation” on page 50 of the
2004 Annual Report.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2004.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS — SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K and other written reports and oral statements made from time
to time by the Company contain statements which constitute “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties, and are based on assumptions that the Company believes in good faith are reasonable,
but which may be materially different from actual results. Investors can identify these statements
by the fact that they do not relate only to historic or current facts. They may use words such as
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” and other words of
similar meaning in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Any
or all of the Company’s forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other
publications may turn out to be wrong.

Factors that the Company currently believes could cause its actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, business
and economic conditions and trends in the markets the Company serves; the timing or extent of any
recovery of the economy; the level and timing of federal and state transportation funding; levels
of construction spending in the markets the Company serves; unfavorable weather conditions; fuel
costs; transportation costs; competition from new or existing competitors; changes in environmental
and other governmental regulations; ability to recognize increased sales and quantifiable savings
from internal expansion projects; ability to successfully integrate acquisitions quickly and in a
cost-effective manner and achieve anticipated profitability; changes in capital availability or
costs; successful development and implementation of the structural composite technological process
and strategic products for specific market segments; unanticipated costs or other adverse effects
associated with structural composite revenue levels, product pricing, and cost associated with
manufacturing ramp up; the financial strength of the structural composite customers and suppliers;
business and economic conditions and trends in the trucking and composites industries in various
geographic regions; possible disruption in commercial activities related to terrorist activity and
armed conflict, such as reduced end-user purchases relative to expectations; the timing and occurrence of events that may be subject to
circumstances beyond the Company’s control; and other risk factors listed from time to time in the
Company’s filings with the SEC.



Investors are also cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all
potential risks or uncertainties. Other factors besides those listed may also adversely affect the
Company and may be material to the Company. The forward-looking statements in this document are
intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Sections 27A and 21E. These
forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof based on management’s current
expectations, and the Company does not undertake an obligation to update such statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

For a discussion identifying some important factors that could cause actual results to vary
materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, see the Company’s Securities
and Exchange Commission filings, including, but not limited to, the discussion of “Competition” on
pages 12 and 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” on pages 34-65 of the 2004 Annual Report and “Note
A: Accounting Policies” and “Note N: Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial
Statements” on pages 31 and 32, respectively, of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
included in the 2004 Annual Report.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of December 31, 2004, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief
Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures and the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material
information required to be disclosed is made known to them in a timely manner as of December 31,
2004 and further concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles as of December 31, 2004.

The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company’s
control system will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.



The Company’s management has issued its annual report on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting, which included management’s assessment that the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2004. The Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm has issued an attestation report agreeing with management’s assessment that
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2004.
Management’s report on the Company’s internal controls and the related attestation report of the
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm appear on pages 10 and 11 of the 2004
Annual Report, and those reports are hereby incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. See also
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Internal
Control and Accounting and Reporting Risk” on page 52 of the 2004 Annual Report.

Included among the Exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forms of “Certifications”
of the Company’s CEO and CFO as required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 (the “Section 302 Certification”). The Section 302 Certifications refer to this evaluation
of the Company’s disclosure policies and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.
The information in this section should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications
for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.
