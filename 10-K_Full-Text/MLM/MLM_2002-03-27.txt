PART I

ITEM  1.    BUSINESS

General

Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the “Company”) is the United States’
second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry, including
highways, infrastructure, commercial, and residential. The Company also
manufactured and marketed in 2001 magnesia-based products, including
heat-resistant refractories products for the steel industry, chemicals products
for industrial, agricultural, and environmental uses, and dolomitic lime. In
2001, the Company’s aggregates segment accounted for 93% of the Company’s total
net sales, and the Company’s magnesia-based products segment accounted for 7%
of the Company’s total net sales.

The Company was formed in November 1993 as a North Carolina corporation to
be the successor to substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the
materials group of Martin Marietta Corporation and its subsidiaries. An
initial public offering of a portion of the common stock of the Company (the
“Common Stock”) was completed in February 1994 whereby 8,797,500 shares of
Common Stock (representing approximately 19% of the shares outstanding) were
sold at an initial public offering price of $23 per share. Lockheed Martin
Corporation, which was formed as the result of a business combination between
Martin Marietta Corporation and Lockheed Corporation in March 1995, owned
approximately 81% of the Common Stock directly and through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Martin Marietta Investments Inc., until October 1996.

In October 1996, the outstanding Common Stock of Martin Marietta Materials
that was held by Lockheed Martin Corporation became available to the public
market when Lockheed Martin disposed of its 81% ownership interest. This
transaction was completed by means of a tax-free exchange offer pursuant to
which Lockheed Martin stockholders were given the opportunity to exchange
shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of the Company’s Common
Stock, which resulted in 100% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock being
publicly traded.

As of May 28, 1997, the Company purchased all of the outstanding common
stock of American Aggregates Corporation (“American Aggregates”) along with
certain other assets from American Aggregates’ former parent, CSR America,
Inc., for an acquisition price of approximately $242 million in cash plus
certain assumed liabilities (the “American Aggregates Acquisition”). The
American Aggregates Acquisition included the Ohio and Indiana operations of
American Aggregates with 29 production facilities and increased the Company’s
annual production capacity by more than 25.0 million tons — in addition to
adding over 1.0 billion tons of mineral reserves, of which approximately 700.0
million were zoned for production, and 11,000 acres of property. American
Aggregates was a leading supplier of aggregates products in Indianapolis,
Cincinnati, Dayton, and Columbus.

As of December 4, 1998, the Company acquired the common stock of Redland
Stone Products Company (“Redland Stone”) from an affiliate of Lafarge SA for
$272 million in cash plus normal balance sheet liabilities and approximately $8
million estimated for certain other assumed liabilities and transaction costs
(the “Redland Stone Acquisition”). The Company did not assume any long-term
debt of Redland Stone. Redland Stone was a leading producer of aggregates and
asphaltic concrete in the State of Texas and had mineral reserves which
exceeded 1.0 billion tons. The Redland Stone



Acquisition expanded the Aggregates division’s business by adding operating
facilities in the southwest United States, expanding the Company’s presence in
the asphalt production business, adding significant long-term mineral reserve
capacity, and increasing the Company’s access to rail transportation.

As of October 31, 1998, the Company purchased an initial 14% interest in
the business of Meridian Aggregates Company (“Meridian”). As of April 3, 2001,
the Company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of
Meridian under the purchase option terms of the original investment agreement.
The purchase consideration consisted of $238 million, including the original
October 1998 investment of $42 million, the retirement of debt, the forgiveness
of related party obligations, and estimated amounts for certain other assumed
liabilities and transaction costs, plus the assumption of normal balance sheet
liabilities (the “Meridian Acquisition”). The purchase consideration is
subject to normal post-closing adjustments and appropriate accruals. At the
time of the Meridian transaction, Meridian operated 25 aggregates production
facilities and seven rail-served distribution yards in 11 states in the
southwestern and western United States and sold aggregates to customers in 14
states, including six states in which the Company had not previously conducted
any business. The Meridian Acquisition added more than 1.6 billion tons of
aggregates reserves, expanded the Company’s presence in the southwest and
western states, and increased its ability to use rail as a mode of
transportation.

As of May 1, 2001, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialties, sold certain assets related to its
refractories business to a subsidiary of Minerals Technologies Inc. for $34
million. The Company retained certain current assets (including accounts
receivable) and certain liabilities relating to the refractories business. In
an accompanying manufacturing agreement, Magnesia Specialties agreed to supply
the subsidiary of Minerals Technologies with certain refractories products
principally from the Company’s Manistee, Michigan plant for up to two years
following the sale. The sale of Magnesia Specialties’ refractories products
business lessens the Magnesia Specialties division’s dependence on the steel
industry. Excluding refractories products, Magnesia Specialties’ sales to the
steel industry would account for 52% of the division’s 2001 net sales, as
compared to 65% including refractories.

In 2001, the Company transferred the operating responsibility for its
Woodville, Ohio dolomitic lime operation to the MidAmerica Division of the
Aggregates division. The Woodville, Ohio operation produces and sells
dolomitic lime to the steel industry and produces and sells approximately 1.0
million tons per year of aggregates to construction businesses. However, the
Woodville, Ohio operation will continue to be reported by the Company within
the Magnesia Specialties segment.

The Company believes that under its Magnesia Specialties segment’s current
operating structure, which carries a lower invested asset base, the dolomitic
lime and magnesia chemicals businesses provide an opportunity to generate
attractive earnings and cash flows in 2002 and beyond.

The Company announced in February 1997 that it had entered into agreements
giving the Company rights to commercialize certain proprietary technologies
related to the Company’s business. One of the agreements gives the Company the
opportunity to pursue the use of certain fiber-reinforced polymer composites
technology for products where corrosion resistance and high strength-to-weight
ratios are important factors, such as bridge decks, marine applications, and
other structures and applications. The Company continued its research and
development activities during 2001 in this new



product area, and continued manufacturing (through a contractor) and marketing
certain of the products. This technology, if fully developed by the Company,
would complement and expand the Company’s business. In addition, the Company
continued in 2001 to explore the viability of certain technology related to
microbial products for enhanced plant growth. The Company had limited revenue
and no profits from these technologies in 2001. Also, in 1999 and 2000 the
Company made investments in a start-up company, Industrial Microwave Systems,
that has proprietary technology for use in applications related to industrial
heating and drying, food processing, and aseptic packaging. There can be no
assurance that any of the technologies will become profitable.

The Company is replacing its existing information systems with an
enterprise-wide information solution through J. D. Edwards World Solutions
Company. The Company successfully completed the system design and
implementation phase of the accounting, financial reporting, and human
resources/payroll packages in 2001. The capital requirements for this project,
excluding system replacements for acquisitions not currently on the Company’s
Raleigh-based systems (principally the Redland and Meridian Acquisitions) are
expected to be $26.3 million, with $13.0 million expended in 2001 and $4.0
million expended in 2000. Currently it is anticipated that the full system
implementation will take an additional two years.

Business Segment Information

The Company in 2001 operated in two reportable business segments. These
segments are aggregates products and magnesia-based chemicals, refractories,
and dolomitic lime products. As of May 1, 2001, the Company sold the
refractories business of its Magnesia Specialties segment. Information
concerning the Company’s net sales, operating profit, assets employed, and
certain additional information attributable to each reportable industry segment
for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001 is included in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” on pages 36 through 38 of the Company’s 2001 Annual Report to
Shareholders (the “2001 Annual Report”), which information is incorporated
herein by reference.

Aggregates

The Company’s aggregates segment processes and sells granite, limestone,
sand and gravel, and other aggregates products for use in all sectors of the
public infrastructure, commercial, and residential construction industries.
The Company is the United States’ second largest producer of aggregates. In
2001, the Company shipped approximately 192 million tons of aggregates
primarily to customers in 31 southeastern, southwestern, midwestern, central,
and western states, in addition to Canada and the Bahamas, generating net sales
and earnings from operations of $1.4 billion and $194 million, respectively.

The Aggregates division markets its products primarily to the construction
industry, with approximately 44% of its shipments made to contractors in
connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the
balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with
commercial and residential construction projects. As a result of dependence
upon the construction industry, the profitability of aggregates producers is
sensitive to national, regional, and local economic conditions, and
particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, which is affected by
fluctuations in interest rates, and demographic and population shifts and to
changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector.
The Company’s aggregates business is



concentrated principally in the southeast, southwest, midwest, and central
states. In addition, the Company’s Meridian Acquisition and subsequent smaller
acquisitions in 2001 have expanded the Company’s presence into the western
states. Aggregates products are sold and shipped from a network of 343
quarries and distribution facilities in 28 states, as well as the Bahamas and
Canada, although the Company’s five largest shipment states (Texas, North
Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, and Iowa) account for approximately 56% of total net
sales by state of destination. The Company’s business is accordingly affected
by the economies in these regions.

Until recently, economic growth in the United States had been generally
strong in the areas served by the Company. However, the current recession,
weakening regional economies, particularly in the southeast and central states,
and the economic fallout of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, adversely
affected results of the Aggregates division. If this weakness in the economy
continues, particularly in areas where the Company is concentrated, or if
federal infrastructure appropriation levels are reduced, or a reduction occurs
or continues in state and local infrastructure spending, the Aggregates
division will continue to be adversely affected.

The Company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal, due primarily
to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its
markets. As a result of the Meridian Acquisition, the American Aggregates
Acquisition, and several other smaller acquisitions in the western and upper
midwestern regions of the United States, more of the Company’s aggregates
operations have exposure to weather-related risk during the winter months. The
division’s operations that are concentrated principally in the northern region
of the country generally experience more severe winter weather conditions than
the division’s operations in the Southeast and Southwest. Due to these
factors, the Company’s second and third quarters are generally the strongest,
with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results. Results in
any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the Company’s annual results.
Similarly, the division’s operations near the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts are at
risk for hurricane activity and have experienced hurricane-related losses in
recent years, which have had a significant adverse impact on the financial
performance of the Company.

Aggregates can be found in abundant quantities throughout the United
States, and there are many producers nationwide. However, as a general rule,
shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of
transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value
of the product itself. As a result, proximity of quarry facilities to
customers is the most important factor in competition for aggregates business
and helps explain the highly fragmented nature of the aggregates industry. As
described below, the Company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks, but also
has access to a lower-cost river barge and ocean vessel network. In addition,
the Redland Stone Acquisition, the Meridian Acquisition, and other recent
acquisitions have enabled the Company to extend its reach through increased
access to rail transportation.

A growing percentage of the Company’s aggregates shipments are being moved
by rail or water through a distribution yard network. In 1994, 93% of the
Company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck, while the balance of 7% was
moved by rail. In contrast, the Company’s aggregates shipments were moved 77%
by truck, 15% by rail, and 8% by water in 2001. The Company has an extensive
network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the Ohio and
Mississippi River systems from western Pennsylvania throughout the central and
southern United States and the Bahamas, as well as distribution centers along
the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. The Gulf and Atlantic coastal areas
are being supplied in part from the Bahamas location, two large quarries on the



Ohio River system, and a Canadian quarry on the Strait of Canso in Nova Scotia.
In addition, the Company’s recent acquisitions, especially the Redland Stone
and Meridian Acquisitions, have expanded its ability to ship by rail.
Accordingly, in addition to increasing the Company’s geographic presence
through acquisitions, the Company has also enhanced its reach through its
ability to provide cost-effective coverage of certain coastal markets on the
east coast and reaching as far as Texas, and to ship products in and to Canada,
the Caribbean, and parts of South America, as well as to additional geographic
areas which can be accessed economically by its expanded distribution system.
In 2001, the Company modernized and expanded the plant capacity at its Bahamas
location, which provides the opportunity for the Company to capture future
potential market growth and reduce costs.

As the Company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water,
embedded freight costs have eroded gross margins. This typically occurs where
the Company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution
location by rail or water, and the customer pays a selling price that includes
a freight component. Margins are negatively affected because the customer
typically does not pay the Company a profit associated with the transportation
component of the selling price. Moreover, the Meridian Acquisition and its
rail-based distribution network, coupled with the extensive use of rail service
in the Southwest, increases the Company’s dependence on and exposure to
railroad performance, including track congestion, crew availability, and power
failures, and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts.
The waterborne distribution network increases the Company’s exposure to
certain risks, including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts,
demurrage costs, and barge or ship availability.

Historically, the Company has focused on the production of aggregates and
has not integrated vertically in a substantial manner into other construction
materials businesses. In recent transactions, however, the Company has
acquired asphaltic concrete, ready mixed concrete, paving construction,
trucking, and other businesses which establish vertical integration that
complement its aggregates business. These vertically integrated operations
accounted for about 14% of net sales in 2001, with no single operation
contributing more than 10% of total net sales. As the Company continues its
expansion strategy westward, where vertically integrated operations are the
norm, profit margins are generally adversely affected. Generally these
operations have lower profit margins than aggregates products.

Environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult
for the construction aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to
develop new quarry operations. Although it cannot be predicted what policies
will be adopted in the future by federal, state, and local governmental bodies
regarding these matters, the Company anticipates that future restrictions will
likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing
the value of the Company’s existing mineral reserves.

Management believes the Aggregates division’s raw materials, or mineral
reserves, are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for
the foreseeable future. The Company does not anticipate any material
difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for production in its
aggregates segment. The Company’s aggregates reserves exceed 55 years of
production, based on current levels of activity.

The Company generally delivers products in its aggregates segment upon
receipt of orders or requests from customers. Accordingly, there is no
significant backlog information. Inventory of



aggregates is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid
delivery requirements of customers.

Magnesia Specialties

The Company in 2001 also manufactured and marketed dolomitic lime,
magnesia-based heat-resistant refractories products for the steel industry, and
magnesia-based chemicals products for industrial, agricultural, and
environmental uses, including wastewater treatment, sulfur dioxide scrubbing,
and acid neutralization. As of May 1, 2001, the Company sold certain assets
relating to the refractories business of its Magnesia Specialties segment to a
subsidiary of Minerals Technologies Inc. The Company’s Magnesia Specialties
division generated net sales in 2001 of $99.5 million and earnings from
operations of $3.2 million. Approximately 26.9% of these sales were associated
with the sold refractories business, including sales of certain refractories
products to the subsidiary of Minerals Technologies pursuant to a related
manufacturing agreement. Magnesia Specialties’ refractories and dolomitic lime
products are sold primarily to the steel industry. Accordingly, the division’s
profitability has historically depended on the production of steel and the
related marketplace, and a significant portion of the division’s product
pricing structure has historically been affected by current economic conditions
within the steel industry. The sale of Magnesia Specialties’ refractories
business in 2001 will lessen the Magnesia Specialties division’s dependence on
the steel industry over time.

In 2001, the division’s refractories and dolomitic lime product areas
continued to be negatively impacted by global steel industry conditions. The
division’s steel-related product areas’ performance followed the steel
industry’s performance. As a result, the continued slowdown experienced in the
steel industry during 2001 and continued high levels of steel imports
negatively affected earnings from operations for 2001. Higher-than-expected
costs for natural gas, which is used to fuel some of the division’s kilns in
the manufacture of its products, negatively affected earnings from operations
during the first half of 2001, before returning to more normal levels by year
end. The underabsorption of fixed costs associated with the conversion of the
division’s Manistee, Michigan plant to a magnesia chemicals facility, as a
result of the sale of the refractories business, also negatively impacted
earnings from operations for 2001. Competitive pricing pressures continued
throughout 2001. The division’s chemicals products continued to diversify in
chemicals used as flame retardants, in wastewater treatment, and to reduce
stack pollution, and is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the
refractories or dolomitic lime businesses.

The principal raw materials used in the Company’s Magnesia Specialties
division’s products are dolomitic limestone, brine, and imported magnesia.
Management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone to produce
dolomitic lime and its reserves of brine are sufficient to permit production at
the required operational levels for the foreseeable future, which levels are
expected to be lower over time than present operational levels as a result of
the sale of the refractories business in 2001. The supply of natural and
synthetic magnesia is abundant worldwide. In 2001, the Company purchased some
of its magnesia requirements from various sources located in China. While the
Company does not expect an interruption in the supply of magnesia from these
sources, various factors associated with economic and political uncertainty in
China could result in future supply interruptions. If such an interruption
were to occur, the Company believes it could obtain alternate supplies
worldwide, although there could be no assurance that the Company could do so at
current prices. Alternatively, the Company believes it could adjust its mix of
products and/or increase production at



its Manistee, Michigan plant. Moreover, the sale of Magnesia Specialties’
refractories business in 2001 will lessen the Magnesia Specialties division’s
magnesia requirements over time.

The Company generally delivers its Magnesia Specialties division’s
products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers. Accordingly, there
is no significant backlog information. Inventory for the Magnesia Specialties
division’s products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet
rapid delivery requirements of customers. The Company has provided extended
payment terms to certain international customers.

Patents and Trademarks

As of March 22, 2002, the Company owns, has the right to use, or has
pending applications for approximately 70 patents pending or granted by the
United States and various countries and approximately 63 trademarks related to
its Magnesia Specialties business and its developing technologies and services
business. The Company believes that its rights under its existing patents,
patent applications, and trademarks are of value to its operations, but no one
patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the
conduct of the Company’s business as a whole.

Customers

No material part of the business of either segment of the Company is
dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers, the loss of any one
of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment. The Company’s
products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry.
Although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works
projects, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state,
county, or municipal governments, or agencies thereof.

Competition

Because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates business,
competition tends to be limited to producers in proximity to the Company’s
individual production facilities. Although all of the Company’s locations
experience competition, the Company believes that it is generally a leading
producer in the areas it serves. Competition is based primarily on quarry
location and price, but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are
also factors.

The Company is the second largest producer of aggregates in the United
States based on tons shipped. There are over 4,000 companies in the United
States that produce aggregates. The largest five producers account for
approximately 25% of the total market. The Company competes with a number of
other large and small producers. The Company believes that its ability to
transport materials by ocean vessels and river barges and its increased access
to rail transportation as a result of the Redland Stone and Meridian
Acquisitions, and other transactions, has enhanced the Company’s ability to
compete in certain extended areas. Certain of the Company’s competitors in the
aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the Company.

The Magnesia Specialties division of the Company competes with various
companies in different geographic and product areas. The division competes
principally on the basis of quality, price, and technical support for its
products. The Magnesia Specialties division also competes for sales



to customers located outside the United States with sales to such customers
accounting for approximately $11.8 million in net sales in 2001 (representing
approximately 12% of net sales of the Magnesia Specialties segment) principally
in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Korea. The sale of the
refractories business in 2001 has reduced division sales to foreign customers.
The Magnesia Specialties division’s sales to foreign customers were $20.4
million in 2000 and $21.0 million in 1999.

Research and Development

The Company conducts research and development activities for its Magnesia
Specialties segment at its plant in Manistee, Michigan, and at various
locations for the new proprietary technologies. The Company closed its
Baltimore, Maryland, laboratory after the sale of the refractories business in
2001, and transferred the remaining research and development activities for its
Magnesia Specialties segment to its Manistee, Michigan plant. In general, the
Company’s research and development efforts in 2001 were directed to applied
technological development for the use of its chemicals products and for its
proprietary technologies, including composite materials and microwave
technology. The Company spent approximately $0.6 million in 2001, $2.3 million
in 2000, and $2.8 million in 1999 on research and development activities.

Environmental Regulations

The Company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal, state,
and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety,
and other regulatory matters. Certain of the Company’s operations may from
time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or
hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations.
Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the
Company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification, renewal, and
revocation. The Company regularly monitors and reviews its operations,
procedures, and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations.
Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent
in the operation of the Company’s businesses, as it is with other companies
engaged in similar businesses, and there can be no assurance that environmental
liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the Company in the
future. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy for environmental
costs, amounts are not accrued and included in the Company’s financial
statements until it is probable that a liability has been incurred and such
amounts can be estimated reasonably. The environmental accruals are estimated
based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and generally not
discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other
claims. Costs incurred by the Company in connection with environmental matters
in the preceding two fiscal years were not material to the Company’s operations
or financial condition.

The Company believes that its operations and facilities, both owned or
leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and
that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s operations or financial condition. See “Legal Proceedings” on page
15 of this Form 10-K and “Note M: Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes
to Financial Statements” on page 24 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Environmental and Litigation
Matters” on page 41 of the 2001 Annual Report. However, future events, such as
changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or
enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential
health



hazards of certain products or business activities, may give rise to additional
compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the
Company.

In general, quarry sites must comply with noise, water discharge, and air
quality regulations, zoning, and special use permitting requirements,
applicable mining regulations, and federal health and safety requirements. As
new quarry sites are located and acquired, the Company works closely with local
authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries
in such a way as to minimize disturbances. The Company frequently acquires
large tracts of land so that quarry and production facilities can be situated
substantial distances from surrounding property owners. Also, the Company’s
ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its
facilities further away from residential areas. The Company maintains a
centralized blasting function for its quarry operations and has established
policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners.

The Company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to
the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use. The
Company generally reclaims its quarries on an ongoing basis, reclaiming
mined-out areas of the quarry while continuing operations at other areas of the
site. Historically, the Company has not incurred extraordinary or substantial
costs in connection with the closing of quarries. Reclaimed quarry sites owned
by the Company are available for sale, typically for commercial development or
use as reservoirs.

As is the case with other companies in the same industry, some of the
Company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica, a common
mineral. Excessive, prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of
crystalline silica has been associated with nonmalignant lung disease. The
carcinogenic potential of crystalline silica was evaluated by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer and later by the U.S. National Toxicology
Program. In 1987, the agency found limited evidence of carcinogenicity in
humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. The National
Toxicology Program concluded in 1991 that crystalline silica is “reasonably
anticipated to be a carcinogen.” In October 1996, the International Agency for
Research on Cancer issued another report stating that “inhaled crystalline
silica in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational sources is
carcinogenic to humans.” The Mine Safety and Health Administration has
included the development of a crystalline silica standard as one of its
long-term goals. The Company, through safety information sheets and other
means, communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions to
employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive, prolonged
inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular.

The EPA in November 1996 proposed certain changes to the regulations
relating to the standard for particulate matter in connection with air quality,
which were recently placed into law as the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards. The new law places an ambient air limit on the emission of fine
particles (smaller than 2.5 microns) that typically result from industrial,
motor vehicle, and power generation fuel combustion, in addition to the coarse
particles previously regulated. As adopted, the regulations impact many
industries, including the aggregates industry. The National Stone, Sand and
Gravel Association (“NSSGA”) joined a lawsuit with many other industries
challenging the standard and the lack of scientific data available supporting
the limits and the ability of industry to monitor the pollutant. In May 1999,
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the
EPA’s PM2.5 and ozone national ambient air quality standards. The EPA appealed
the Court of Appeals’ decision to the United States Supreme Court, which
decided on



February 27, 2001 that the EPA has the authority to issue air quality
standards and remanded the case for reexamination of the standards proposed by
the EPA. The Company will not be able to determine the applicability of any
new rules or the costs associated with any required standards until an emission
standard is adopted. Based on field studies showing that crushed stone
operations have a near negligible impact on ambient PM2.5 concentrations, the
Company believes that any such costs would not have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s operations or its financial condition.

As a result of the processing of dolomitic limestone at the Magnesia
Specialties division’s Woodville, Ohio, facility, lime kiln dust (“LKD”) is
produced as a by-product. The Company historically placed the LKD in the
quarry as part of reclamation required under its mining permit. In 1994, the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (“OEPA”) promulgated regulations that
applied to the disposal of LKD and regulated it as a solid waste. The
regulations required the Company to change its disposal method and institute
additional controls. In order to comply with the regulations, the Company
executed an administrative order with the OEPA on November 24, 1997 requiring
the Company to submit a permit application for a landfill by May 1998, which
was duly submitted. The Company, along with the National Lime Association and
other lime producers in Ohio, introduced a bill before the State of Ohio Senate
in August 2000 proposing that LKD be regulated under the mining laws and
excluded as a solid waste thus eliminating the requirement for a landfill
permit. The bill was passed and ratified in 2001. Based upon the result of
the legislation, the facility will not require a landfill permit, and the
Company will not incur any significant compliance costs associated with
implementation of the legislation.

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require the EPA to develop
regulations for a broad spectrum of industrial sectors that emit hazardous air
pollutants, including lime manufacturing. The new standards to be established
would require plants to install feasible control equipment for certain
hazardous air pollutants, thereby significantly reducing air emissions. The
Company is actively participating with other lime manufacturers in working with
the EPA to define test protocols, better define the scope of the standards,
determine the existence and feasibility of various technologies, and develop
realistic emission limitations and continuous emissions monitoring/reporting
requirements for the lime industry. The EPA has conducted testing at lime
manufacturing facilities located in Alabama, Texas, and Ohio, including the
Company’s Woodville facility, the results of which were discussed with the EPA
in 1999 to determine whether the facilities should be subject to these
regulations. The EPA received comments on its proposed technology-based
standards for the industry in November 2000, and a summary of the draft
proposed national emission standards for lime manufacturing plants was released
on December 1, 2001. The Company will not be able to determine the
applicability of the new regulations or the cost associated with any required
standards until the emission standards are formally adopted. The Company
believes that any costs associated with the upgrade and/or replacement of
equipment required to comply with the new regulations would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial condition but can
give no assurance that the compliance costs will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition or results of the Magnesia Specialties
segment’s operations.

In February 1998, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (“GDNR”)
determined that both the Company and the Georgia Department of Transportation
(“GDOT”) are responsible parties for investigation and remediation at the
Company’s Camak Quarry in Thomson, Georgia, due to the discovery of
trichloroethene (“TCE”) above its naturally occurring background concentration
in a drinking water well on site. The Company provided the GDNR with
information indicating that the



source of the release was either from an asphalt plant that was on the site in
the early 1970’s or from a maintenance shop that was operated on the property
in the 1940’s and 1950’s before the Company purchased the property. The
Company entered into a Consent Order with GDNR to conduct an environmental
assessment of the site and file a report of the findings. The Company and GDOT
signed an agreement to share evenly the costs of the assessment work. The
assessment report was completed and filed. Based upon the results of the
assessment report, GDOT withdrew from the cost sharing agreement and has
indicated it will not share in any future remediation costs. The Company is
funding the entire cost of future investigations and remediation which will
occur over several years. Management believes any costs incurred by the
Company associated with the site will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s operations or its financial condition.

In December 1998, the GDNR determined that the Company, the GDOT, and two
other parties which operated an asphalt plant are responsible parties for
investigation and remediation at the Company’s Ruby Quarry in Macon, Georgia.
The Company was designated by virtue of its ownership of the property. GDOT
was designated because it caused a release of TCE above its naturally occurring
background concentration in the groundwater at the site. The two other parties
were designated because both entities operated the asphalt plant at the site.
The groundwater contamination was discovered when the Company’s tenant vacated
the premises and environmental testing was conducted. The Company and GDOT
signed an agreement to share the costs of the assessment work. The report of
the assessment work was filed with the GDNR. GDOT entered into a Consent Order
with GDNR agreeing to conduct additional testing and any necessary remediation
at the site. On May 21, 2001, GDNR issued separate Administrative Orders
against the Company and other responsible parties to require all parties to
participate with GDOT to undertake additional testing and any necessary
remediation. If the Company is required to fund the cost of remediation, the
Company will pursue its right of contribution from the responsible parties.
Management believes any costs incurred by the Company associated with the site
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its
financial condition.

In the vicinity of and beneath the Magnesia Specialties division’s
Manistee, Michigan, facility, there is an underground plume of material
originating from the adjacent Packaging Corporation of America (“PCA”)
property. The Company believes the plume consists of paper mill waste. On
September 8, 1983, the PCA plume and property were listed on the National
Priorities List (“NPL”) under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “Superfund” statute). The PCA
plume is subject to a Record of Decision issued by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (“USEPA”) on May 2, 1994, pursuant to which PCA (and now its
successor, Pactiv Corporation (“Pactiv”)) is required to conduct annual
monitoring. The USEPA has not required remediation of the groundwater
contamination. On January 10, 2002, the Michigan Department of Environmental
Quality (“MDEQ”) issued a Notice of Demand letter to the Company, PCA, and
Pactiv indicating that it believes the plume has commingled with underground
brine contamination historically released at the Manistee plant and designating
the parties as responsible for investigation and remediation. The MDEQ has
requested meetings and cost sharing with the Company, PCA, and Pactiv.
Michigan law provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally
liable, and, therefore, the Company is potentially liable for the full cost of
funding the investigation and any necessary remediation. Michigan law also
provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among responsible
parties if it is capable of division. The Company believes that the liability
will be apportioned and that any such costs attributed to the Company’s brine
contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
operations or its financial condition but can



give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the
compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or results of the Magnesia Specialties segment’s operations.

Employees

As of March 22, 2002, the Company has approximately 6,900 employees.
Approximately 5,200 are hourly employees and approximately 1,700 are salaried
employees. Included among these employees are approximately 800 hourly
employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 14% of the Company’s
Aggregates division’s hourly employees are members of a labor union, while 92%
of the Magnesia Specialties division’s hourly employees are represented by
labor unions. The Company’s principal union contracts cover employees at the
Manistee, Michigan, magnesia-based products plant and the Woodville, Ohio, lime
plant. The current Manistee labor union contract was ratified in August 1999
and expires in August 2003. The current Woodville labor union contract was
ratified in June 2001 and expires in June 2006. The Company considers its
relations with its employees to be good.

ITEM  2.    PROPERTIES

Aggregates

As of March 22, 2002, the Company processed or shipped aggregates from 343
quarries and distribution yards in 28 states in the southeast, southwest,
midwest, central, and western United States and in Canada and the Bahamas, of
which 98 are located on land owned by the Company free of major encumbrances,
72 are on land owned in part and leased in part, 159 are on leased land, and 14
are on facilities neither owned nor leased, where raw materials are removed
under an agreement. In addition, the Company processed and shipped ready mixed
concrete and/or asphalt products from 23 properties in 5 states in the southern
United States, of which 11 are located on land owned by the Company free of
major encumbrances, 2 are on land owned in part and leased in part, and 10 are
on leased land.

Magnesia Specialties

The Magnesia Specialties division currently operates a major manufacturing
facility in Manistee, Michigan, and smaller processing plants in Bridgeport,
Connecticut, and Lenoir City, Tennessee. All of these facilities are owned,
except Lenoir City, which is leased. The Company has also entered into several
third-party toll-manufacturing agreements pursuant to which it processes
various chemical products. In addition, in 2001 the Company transferred
operating responsibility for its Woodville, Ohio dolomitic lime operation from
its Magnesia Specialties division to the Mid-America Division of its Aggregates
division, but the Woodville, Ohio operations will continue to be reported by
the Company within the Magnesia Specialties segment. The Woodville, Ohio
facilities are owned.

Other Properties

The Company’s corporate headquarters, which it owns, is located in
Raleigh, North Carolina. The Company owns and leases various administrative
offices and research and development laboratories for its Aggregates division
and its Magnesia Specialties division.



The Company’s principal properties, which are of varying ages and are of
different construction types, are believed to be generally in good condition,
are generally well maintained, and are generally suitable and adequate for the
purposes for which they are used. The principal properties are believed to be
utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 80% and are capable
of supporting a higher level of market demand.

ITEM  3.
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time claims of various types are asserted against the Company
arising out of its operations in the normal course of business, including
claims relating to land use and permits, safety, health, and environmental
matters (such as noise abatement, vibrations, air emissions, and water
discharges). Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and it is not
possible to determine the probable outcome of, or the amount of liability, if
any, from, these matters. In the opinion of management of the Company (which
opinion is based in part upon consideration of the opinion of counsel), it is
unlikely that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s operations or its financial condition. However, there can be
no assurance that an adverse outcome in any of such litigation would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company or its operating segments.
