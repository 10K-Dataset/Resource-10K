ITEM 1.       BUSINESS

General

Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the “Company”) is the United States’
second largest producer of aggregates for the construction industry, including
highways, infrastructure, commercial, and residential. The Company also
manufactures and markets magnesia-based chemical products used in industrial,
agricultural, and environmental applications, and dolomitic lime sold primarily
to the steel industry. In 2002, the Company’s aggregates segment accounted for
95% of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company’s magnesia-based products
segment accounted for 5% of the Company’s total net sales.

The Company was formed in November 1993 as a North Carolina corporation to
be the successor to substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the
materials group of Martin Marietta Corporation and its subsidiaries. An
initial public offering of a portion of the common stock of the Company (the
“Common Stock”) was completed in February 1994 whereby 8,797,500 shares of
Common Stock (representing approximately 19% of the shares outstanding) were
sold at an initial public offering price of $23 per share. Lockheed Martin
Corporation, which was formed as the result of a business combination between
Martin Marietta Corporation and Lockheed Corporation in March 1995, owned
approximately 81% of the Common Stock directly and through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Martin Marietta Investments Inc., until October 1996.

In October 1996, the outstanding Common Stock of Martin Marietta Materials
that was held by Lockheed Martin Corporation became available to the public
market when Lockheed Martin disposed of its 81% ownership interest. This
transaction was completed by means of a tax-free exchange offer pursuant to
which Lockheed Martin stockholders were given the opportunity to exchange
shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of the Company’s Common
Stock, which resulted in 100% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock being
publicly traded.

As of May 28, 1997, the Company purchased all of the outstanding common
stock of American Aggregates Corporation (“American Aggregates”) along with
certain other assets from American Aggregates’ former parent, CSR America,
Inc., for an acquisition price of approximately $242 million in cash plus
certain assumed liabilities (the “American Aggregates Acquisition”). The
American Aggregates Acquisition included the Ohio and Indiana operations of
American Aggregates with 29 production facilities and increased the Company’s
annual production capacity by more than 25.0 million tons — in addition to
adding over 1.0 billion tons of mineral reserves, of which approximately 700.0
million were zoned for production, and 11,000 acres of property. American
Aggregates was a leading supplier of aggregates products in Indianapolis,
Cincinnati, Dayton, and Columbus.

As of December 4, 1998, the Company acquired the common stock of Redland
Stone Products Company (“Redland Stone”) from an affiliate of Lafarge SA for
$272 million in cash plus normal balance sheet liabilities and approximately $8
million estimated for certain other assumed liabilities and transaction costs
(the “Redland Stone Acquisition”). The Company did not assume any long-term


debt of Redland Stone. Redland Stone was a leading producer of aggregates and
asphaltic concrete in the State of Texas and had mineral reserves which
exceeded 1.0 billion tons. The Redland Stone Acquisition expanded the
Aggregates division’s business by adding operating facilities in the southwest
United States, expanding the Company’s presence in the asphalt production
business, adding significant long-term mineral reserve capacity, and increasing
and diversifying the Company’s access to rail transportation.

As of October 31, 1998, the Company purchased an initial 14% interest in
the business of Meridian Aggregates Company (“Meridian”). As of April 3, 2001,
the Company completed the purchase of all of the remaining interests of
Meridian under the purchase option terms of the original investment agreement.
The purchase consideration consisted of $238 million, including the original
October 1998 investment of $42 million, the retirement of debt, the forgiveness
of related party obligations, and estimated amounts for certain other assumed
liabilities and transaction costs, plus the assumption of normal balance sheet
liabilities (the “Meridian Acquisition”). At the time of the Meridian
transaction, Meridian operated 25 aggregates production facilities and seven
rail-served distribution yards in 11 states in the southwestern and western
United States and sold aggregates to customers in 14 states, including six
states in which the Company had not previously conducted any business. The
Meridian Acquisition added more than 1.6 billion tons of aggregates reserves,
expanded the Company’s presence in the southwest and western states, and
increased its ability to use rail as a mode of transportation.

As of May 1, 2001, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialties, sold certain assets related to its
refractories business to a subsidiary of Minerals Technologies Inc. for $34
million. The Company retained certain current assets (including accounts
receivable) and certain liabilities relating to the refractories business. In
an accompanying manufacturing agreement, Magnesia Specialties agreed to supply
the subsidiary of Minerals Technologies with certain refractories products
principally from the Company’s Manistee, Michigan plant for a period of time
following the sale. This agreement ended in 2002. The sale of Magnesia
Specialties’ refractories products business lessened the Magnesia Specialties
division’s dependence on the steel industry.

In 2001, the Company transferred the operating responsibility for its
Woodville, Ohio dolomitic lime operation to the MidAmerica Division of the
Aggregates division. The Woodville, Ohio operation produces and sells
dolomitic lime to the steel industry and produces and sells approximately 1.0
million tons per year of aggregates to construction businesses. However, the
Woodville, Ohio operation will continue to be reported by the Company within
the Magnesia Specialties segment.

In 2002 the Company completed a number of sales of nonstrategic
operations, including the sale of facilities in Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Tennessee, and Virginia. The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities
to divest nonstrategic assets during 2003 in an effort to redeploy capital for
other opportunities.

The Company announced in February 1997 that it had entered into agreements
giving the Company rights to commercialize certain proprietary technologies
related to the Company’s business. One of the agreements gives the Company the
opportunity to pursue the use of certain fiber-reinforced polymer composites
technology for products where corrosion resistance and high strength-to-weight
ratios are important factors, such as bridge decks, marine applications, and
other structures and


applications. The Company continued its research and
development activities during 2002 on these structural composites technologies
and continued manufacturing (in 2002, through a contractor) and marketing
certain of the products. The Company recently entered into an agreement to
lease a 185,000 square foot facility in Sparta, North Carolina, which will
serve as the Company’s assembly and manufacturing hub for its structural
composites business. Manufacturing at this facility is anticipated to commence
in the second half of 2003, with potential expansion in 2004. The Company is
targeting several industries for its fiber-reinforced polymer composite
materials: infrastructure, which includes pedestrian and vehicular bridge
decks; transportation, which includes specialty truck trailers and chassis,
railcar components, and trailer dump beds; and construction, which includes
wall panels, parking decks, and heavy equipment components. In 2002 the
Company announced the installation of bridge decks in two states, bringing its
total to 18 bridge deck installations in 11 states utilizing the Company’s
composite materials technologies. The Company continued to explore
opportunities to introduce its composite bridge installations to foreign
markets. The Company entered into a licensing agreement in 2001 whereby it
will manufacture and market commercial specialty truck trailers in North
America, utilizing fiber-reinforced composite materials. Late in 2002 the
Company also signed a licensing agreement relating to a proprietary composite
sandwich technology, which the Company expects will play an important role in
the product line related to flat panel applications. The Company expects to
ramp up its composites business during 2003, with 2004 expected to be the first
full year of business. The Company will continue to evaluate a variety of
construction-related and commercial uses for composite materials, in addition
to its use in bridge decks and truck trailers. These composite materials
technologies, if fully developed by the Company, would complement and expand
the Company’s business. While the Company expects to increase its revenues
related to its composite materials over the next five years, there can be no
assurance that these technologies will become profitable.

The Company continued in 2002 to explore the viability of certain
technology related to microbial products for enhanced plant growth. As
expected, the Company had limited revenue and no profits from these
technologies in 2002, and has since abandoned these products. Also, in 1999
and 2000 the Company made investments in a start-up company that has
proprietary microwave technology for use in applications related to industrial
heating and drying, food processing, and aseptic packaging. The Company had no
revenue in 2002 from this investment, which was reserved in 2002.

The Company is replacing its existing information systems with an
enterprise-wide information solution supplied primarily through J. D. Edwards &
Company. The capital requirements for this multi-year project, excluding
system replacements for acquired operations not currently using the Company’s
Raleigh-based systems (principally the Redland and Meridian Acquisitions), are
expected to be $27.8 million, with $9.5 million, $13.0 million, and $4.0
million expended in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The timeframe for
completion of the various components of this project has not yet been
determined. The Company believes it has deployed sufficient personnel and
capital to complete this project successfully.

Business Segment Information

The Company in 2002 operated in two reportable business segments:
Aggregates and Magnesia Specialties. Information concerning the Company’s net
sales, operating profit, assets employed, and certain additional information
attributable to each reportable industry segment for each year in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2002 is included in “Management’s
Discussion and


Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” on
pages 26 through 51 of the Company’s 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders (the
“2002 Annual Report”), which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Aggregates

The Company’s Aggregates division processes and sells granite, limestone,
sand, gravel, and other aggregates products for use in all sectors of the
public infrastructure, commercial, and residential construction industries.
The Aggregates division also includes the operation of its other construction
materials businesses. These businesses, acquired through continued selective
vertical integration by the Company, includes primarily asphalt, ready mix
concrete, and road paving operations.

The Company is the United States’ second largest producer of aggregates.
In 2002, the Company shipped approximately 189 million tons of aggregates
primarily to customers in 32 states, in addition to Canada and the Bahamas,
generating net sales and earnings from operations of $1.4 billion and $170
million, respectively.

The Aggregates division markets its products primarily to the construction
industry, with approximately 46% of its shipments made to contractors in
connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the
balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with
commercial and residential construction projects. As a result of dependence
upon the construction industry, the profitability of aggregates producers is
sensitive to national, regional, and local economic conditions, and
particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, which is affected by
fluctuations in interest rates, and demographic and population shifts and to
changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector.
The Company’s aggregates business covers a wide geographic area. The Company’s
aggregates and asphalt products and ready mixed concrete are sold and shipped
from a network of approximately 360 quarries, distribution facilities, and
plants in 28 states, as well as the Bahamas and Canada, although the Company’s
five largest revenue-generating states (Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa,
and Arkansas) account for approximately 54% of total net sales by state of
destination. The Company’s business is accordingly affected by the economies
in these regions and has been adversely affected by the continuing recession
and weaknesses in these economies.

The Company’s aggregates business is also highly seasonal, due primarily
to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity within its
markets. As a result of the Meridian Acquisition, the American Aggregates
Acquisition, and several other smaller acquisitions in the western and upper
midwestern regions of the United States, more of the Company’s aggregates
operations have exposure to weather-related risk during the winter months. The
division’s operations that are concentrated principally in the northern region
of the country generally experience more severe winter weather conditions than
the division’s operations in the Southeast and Southwest. Due to these
factors, the Company’s second and third quarters are generally the strongest,
with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results. Results in
any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the Company’s annual results.
Similarly, the division’s operations near the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts are at
risk for hurricane activity and have experienced weather-related losses in
recent years, which have had a significant adverse impact on the financial
performance of the Company. In 2002, 12 hurricanes or tropical storms
negatively affected the Company’s operations by reducing shipments and
operating efficiencies and increasing certain operating costs.


Aggregates can be found in abundant quantities throughout the United
States, and there are many producers nationwide. However, as a general rule,
shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of
transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value
of the product itself. As a result, proximity of quarry facilities to
customers is the most important factor in competition for aggregates business
and helps explain the highly fragmented nature of the aggregates industry. As
described below, the Company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks, but also
has access to a lower-cost river barge and ocean vessel network. In addition,
the Redland Stone Acquisition, the Meridian Acquisition, and other recent
acquisitions have enabled the Company to extend its reach through increased
access to rail transportation.

A growing percentage of the Company’s aggregates shipments are being moved
by rail or water through a distribution yard network. In 1994, 93% of the
Company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck, while the balance of 7% was
moved by rail. In contrast, the Company’s aggregates shipments were moved 77%
by truck, 14% by rail, and 9% by water in 2002

.

The Company has an extensive
network of aggregates quarries and distribution centers along the Mississippi
River system throughout the central and southern United States and in the
Bahamas, as well as distribution centers along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic
coasts. The Gulf and Atlantic coastal areas are being supplied in part from
the Bahamas location, two large quarries on the Ohio River system, and a
Canadian quarry on the Strait of Canso in Nova Scotia. In addition, the
Company’s acquisitions, especially the Redland Stone and Meridian Acquisitions,
have expanded its ability to ship by rail. Accordingly, in addition to
increasing the Company’s geographic presence through acquisitions, the Company
has also enhanced its reach through its ability to provide cost-effective
coverage of certain coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts, and to ship
products in and to Canada, the Caribbean, and parts of South America, as well
as to additional geographic areas which can be accessed economically by its
expanded distribution system. The Company recently completed a major project
to modernize and expand the plant capacity at its Bahamas location, which
provides the opportunity for the Company to capture future potential market
growth and reduce costs (although there can be no assurance of such growth and
cost reductions).

As the Company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water,
embedded freight costs have consequently reduced gross margins. This typically
occurs where the Company transports aggregates from a production location to a
distribution location by rail or water, and the customer pays a selling price
that includes a freight component. Margins are negatively affected because the
customer typically does not pay the Company a profit associated with the
transportation component of the selling price. Moreover, the Meridian
Acquisition and its rail-based distribution network, coupled with the extensive
use of rail service in the Southwest, increases the Company’s dependence on and
exposure to railroad performance, including track congestion, crew
availability, and power failures, and the ability to renegotiate favorable
railroad shipping contracts. The waterborne distribution network increases the
Company’s exposure to certain risks, including the ability to negotiate
favorable shipping contracts, demurrage costs, fuel costs, barge or ship
availability, and weather disruptions.

The Company’s management believes the overall long-term trend for the
construction aggregates industry continues to be one of consolidation, although
the consolidation trend is slowing as the number of suitable acquisition
targets shrinks. The Company’s Board of Directors and management continue to
review and monitor the Company’s strategic long-term plans, which include
assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged
in similar


businesses, increased market share in the Company’s core businesses,
and pursuing new technological opportunities related to the company’s existing
markets.

Prior to 1998, the Company had historically focused on the production of
aggregates and had not integrated vertically in a substantial manner into other
construction materials businesses. The Company became significantly more
vertically integrated with the Redland Stone Acquisition in 1998 and subsequent
acquisitions, particularly in the southwest, pursuant to which the Company has
acquired asphaltic concrete, ready mixed concrete, paving construction,
trucking, and other businesses, which establish vertical integration that
complement the Company’s aggregates business. These vertically integrated
operations accounted for about 15% of net sales in 2002, with no single
operation contributing more than 10% of total net sales. As the Company
continues its expansion strategy westward, where vertically integrated
operations are the norm, profit margins are generally adversely affected.
Generally these operations have lower gross margins than aggregates products,
and are affected by volatile factors, including fuel costs, operating
efficiencies, and weather, to an even greater extent than the Company’s
aggregates operations. In particular, the road paving and trucking businesses
have been acquired as supplemental operations that were part of larger
acquisitions. As such they do not represent core businesses of the Company.
These operations have typically resulted in losses that are insignificant to
the Company as a whole. The Company continues to review carefully these
operations.

Environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult
for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new
quarry operations. Although it cannot be predicted what policies will be
adopted in the future by federal, state, and local governmental bodies
regarding these matters, the Company anticipates that future restrictions will
likely make zoning and permitting more difficult thereby potentially enhancing
the value of the Company’s existing mineral reserves.

Management believes the Aggregates division’s raw materials, or mineral
reserves, are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for
the foreseeable future. The Company does not anticipate any material
difficulty in obtaining the raw materials that it uses for production in its
aggregates segment. The Company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60
years of production, based on current levels of activity. However, certain
locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to
expand.

The Company generally delivers products in its aggregates segment upon
receipt of orders or requests from customers. Accordingly, there is no
significant backlog information. Inventory of aggregates is generally
maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of
customers. The Company has provided extended payment terms to certain
customers, depending on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the
customer.

Less than 1% of the Aggregates division’s sales are made in foreign
jurisdictions, principally in Canada and the Bahamas.

Magnesia Specialties

The Company in 2002 also manufactured and marketed dolomitic lime and
magnesia-based chemicals products for industrial, agricultural, and
environmental uses. As of May 1, 2001, the


Company sold certain assets
relating to its magnesia-based heat-resistant refractories business of its
Magnesia Specialties segment to a subsidiary of Minerals Technologies Inc. but
continued to manufacture and sell certain refractories products to the
subsidiary of Minerals Technologies pursuant to a related manufacturing
agreement. This manufacturing agreement ended in 2002, and the Magnesia
Specialties division has stopped production and sale of these magnesia-based
refractory products previously sold directly to the steel industry.

Given the high fixed costs associated with the operations of this
division, excess capacity negatively affects its results of operations. In
addition, Magnesia Specialties’ dolomitic lime products are (and its refractory
products were) sold primarily to the steel industry. Accordingly, the
division’s profitability has historically depended on the production of steel
and the related marketplace, and a portion of the division’s product pricing
structure has historically been affected by current business economic
conditions within the steel industry. While the sale of Magnesia Specialties’
refractories business in 2001 lessened the Magnesia Specialties division’s
dependence on the steel industry, Magnesia Specialties’ products used in the
steel industry still accounted for approximately 52% of the division’s net
sales in 2002, attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products.
The Magnesia Specialties division has also experienced losses in accounts
receivable due to customer bankruptcies and is further exposed to additional
potential losses in customer accounts receivable if the steel industry
continues to deteriorate.

Competitive pricing pressures in the Magnesia Specialties’ division also
continued throughout 2002. The division’s chemicals group continued to
diversify in chemicals used as flame retardants, in wastewater treatment, in
pulp and paper production, and to reduce stack pollution, and is not as
dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime business.

The principal raw materials used in the Company’s Magnesia Specialties
division’s products are dolomitic limestone, brine, and imported magnesia.
Management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are
sufficient to permit production at the required operational levels for the
foreseeable future.

Once the Magnesia Specialties division’s reserves of brine are used in the
production process, the division must dispose of the processed brine.
Typically the division does this by reinjecting the processed brine back into
its underground brine reserve network around its facility in Manistee,
Michigan. The division has also sold a portion of this processed brine to
third parties. The Magnesia Specialties division recently entered into a
long-term processed brine supply agreement with The Dow Chemical Company
(“Dow”) pursuant to which Dow will purchase processed brine from the Magnesia
Specialties division for use in Dow’s production of calcium chloride products.
The Magnesia Specialties division also entered into a venture with Dow to
construct, own, and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the
Magnesia Specialties division’s facility in Manistee, Michigan, and Dow’s
facility in Ludington, Michigan.

The supply of natural and synthetic magnesia is abundant worldwide. In
2002, the Company purchased some of its magnesia requirements from various
sources located in China. While the Company does not expect an interruption in
the supply of magnesia from these sources, various factors associated with
economic and political uncertainty in China could result in future supply
interruptions. If such an interruption were to occur, the Company believes it
could obtain alternate supplies worldwide, although there could be no assurance
that the Company could do so at current prices.


Alternatively, the Company
believes it could adjust its mix of products and/or increase production at its
Manistee, Michigan plant.

The Company generally delivers its Magnesia Specialties division’s
products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers. Accordingly, there
is no significant backlog information. Inventory for the Magnesia Specialties
division’s products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet
rapid delivery requirements of customers. The Company has provided extended
payment terms to certain international customers.

Approximately 12% of the Magnesia Specialties division’s products are sold
in foreign jurisdictions, principally in Canada, Mexico, Europe, South America,
and the Pacific Rim, but no single country accounts for 10% or more of the
division’s sales. As a result of these foreign sales, the division’s financial
results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency
exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets. To mitigate
the short-term effects of changes in currency exchange rates, the division
principally uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency in foreign
transactions.

Patents and Trademarks

As of March 20, 2003, the Company owns, has the right to use, or has
pending applications for approximately 65 patents pending or granted by the
United States and various countries and approximately 46 trademarks related to
business. The Company believes that its rights under its existing patents,
patent applications, and trademarks are of value to its operations, but no one
patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the
conduct of the Company’s business as a whole.

Customers

No material part of the business of either segment of the Company is
dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers, the loss of any one
of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment. The Company’s
products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry.
Although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works
projects, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state,
county, or municipal governments, or agencies thereof.

Competition

Because of the impact of transportation costs on the aggregates business,
competition tends to be limited to producers in proximity to the Company’s
individual production facilities. Although all of the Company’s locations
experience competition, the Company believes that it is generally a leading
producer in the areas it serves. Competition is based primarily on quarry
location and price, but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are
also factors.

The Company is the second largest producer of aggregates in the United
States based on tons shipped. There are over 4,000 companies in the United
States that produce aggregates. The largest five producers account for
approximately 25% of the total market. The Company competes with a number of
other large and small producers. The Company believes that its ability to
transport


materials by ocean vessels and river barges and its increased access
to rail transportation as a result of the Redland Stone and Meridian
Acquisitions, and other transactions, have enhanced the Company’s ability to
compete in certain extended areas. Certain of the Company’s competitors in the
aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the Company.

The Magnesia Specialties division of the Company competes with various
companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of
quality, price, and technical support for its products. The Magnesia
Specialties division also competes for sales to customers located outside the
United States with sales to such customers accounting for approximately $8.9
million in net sales in 2002 (representing approximately 12% of net sales of
the Magnesia Specialties segment) principally in Canada, Mexico, Europe, South
America, and the Pacific Rim. The sale of the refractories business in 2001
has reduced division sales to foreign customers. The Magnesia Specialties
division’s sales to foreign customers were $11.8 million in 2001 and $20.4
million in 2000.

Research and Development

The Company conducts research and development activities for its Magnesia
Specialties segment at its plant in Manistee, Michigan, and at various
locations for the new proprietary technologies. In general, the Company’s
research and development efforts in 2002 were directed to applied technological
development for the use of its chemicals products and for its proprietary
technologies, including composite materials. The Company spent approximately
$0.4 million in 2002, $0.6 million in 2001, and $2.3 million in 2000 on
research and development activities.

Environmental and Governmental Regulations

The Company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal, state,
and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety,
and other regulatory matters. Certain of the Company’s operations may from
time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or
hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations.
Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the
Company’s operations and such permits are subject to modification, renewal, and
revocation. The Company regularly monitors and reviews its operations,
procedures, and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations.
Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent
in the operation of the Company’s businesses, as it is with other companies
engaged in similar businesses, and there can be no assurance that environmental
liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the Company in the
future. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy for environmental
costs prior to January 1, 2003, amounts were not accrued and included in the
Company’s financial statements until it was probable that a liability had been
incurred and such amounts could be estimated reasonably. The environmental
accruals were estimated based on internal studies of the required remediation
costs and generally not discounted to their present value or offset for
potential insurance or other claims. Costs incurred by the Company in
connection with environmental matters in the preceding two fiscal years were
not material to the Company’s operations or financial condition. Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.

See “Note A:
Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” on pages 14 through
16 of the 2002 Annual Report.


The Company believes that its operations and facilities, both owned or
leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and
that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s operations or financial condition. See “Legal Proceedings” on page
17 of this Form 10-K and “Note N: Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes
to Financial Statements” on page 25 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Environmental Regulation and
Litigation” on page 41 of the 2002 Annual Report. However, future events, such
as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or
enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential
health hazards of certain products or business activities, may give rise to
additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect
on the Company.

In general, quarry sites must comply with noise, water discharge, and air
quality regulations, zoning, and special use permitting requirements,
applicable mining regulations, and federal health and safety requirements. As
new quarry sites are located and acquired, the Company works closely with local
authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries
in such a way as to minimize disturbances. The Company frequently acquires
large tracts of land so that quarry and production facilities can be situated
substantial distances from surrounding property owners. Also, the Company’s
ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its
facilities further away from residential areas. The Company maintains a
centralized blasting procedure for its quarry operations and has established
policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners.

The Company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to
the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use. The
Company generally reclaims its quarries on an ongoing basis, reclaiming
mined-out areas of the quarry while continuing operations at other areas of the
site. Historically, the Company has not incurred extraordinary or substantial
costs in connection with the closing of quarries. Reclaimed quarry sites owned
by the Company are available for sale, typically for commercial development or
use as reservoirs.

As is the case with other companies in the same industry, some of the
Company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica, a common
mineral. Excessive, prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of
crystalline silica has been associated with nonmalignant lung disease. The
carcinogenic potential of crystalline silica was evaluated by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer and later by the U.S. National Toxicology
Program. In 1987, the agency found limited evidence of carcinogenicity in
humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. The National
Toxicology Program concluded in 1991 that crystalline silica is “reasonably
anticipated to be a carcinogen.” In October 1996, the International Agency for
Research on Cancer issued another report stating that “inhaled crystalline
silica in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational sources is
carcinogenic to humans.” The Mine Safety and Health Administration has
included the development of a crystalline silica standard as one of its
long-term goals. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has
identified occupational overexposure to crystalline silica among its top five
health priorities and committed itself to rulemaking, targeting November 2003
on its regulatory calendar for proposed regulation. The Company, through
safety information sheets and other means, communicates what it believes to be
appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks
associated with excessive, prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and
crystalline silica in particular.


The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require the EPA to develop
regulations for a broad spectrum of industrial sectors that emit hazardous air
pollutants, including lime manufacturing. The new standards to be established
would require plants to install feasible control equipment for certain
hazardous air pollutants, thereby significantly reducing air emissions. The
Company is actively participating with other lime manufacturers in working with
the EPA to define test protocols, better define the scope of the standards,
determine the existence and feasibility of various technologies, and develop
realistic emission limitations and continuous emissions monitoring/reporting
requirements for the lime industry. The EPA has conducted testing at lime
manufacturing facilities located in Alabama, Texas, and Ohio, including the
Company’s Woodville facility, the results of which were discussed with the EPA
in 1999 to determine whether the facilities should be subject to these
regulations. The EPA received comments on its proposed technology-based
standards for the industry in November 2000, and a proposed rule for the
national emission standards for lime manufacturing plants was released on
December 20, 2002. The proposed rules favorably addressed many of the issues
raised by NLA in the negotiation process. NLA and the Company submitted
comments on the proposed rules in February 2003. The Company expects the
proposed rules to be finalized at some point during the last half of 2003. The
USEPA proposed that facilities must be in compliance within three years after
the date of the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. The
Company believes that any costs associated with the upgrade and/or replacement
of equipment required to comply with the new regulations would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial condition
but can give no assurance that the compliance costs will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the Magnesia
Specialties segment’s operations.

In February 1998, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (“GDNR”)
determined that both the Company and the Georgia Department of Transportation
(“GDOT”) are responsible parties for investigation and remediation at the
Company’s Camak Quarry in Thomson, Georgia, due to the discovery of
trichloroethene (“TCE”) above its naturally occurring background concentration
in a drinking water well on site. The Company provided the GDNR with
information indicating that the source of the release was either from an
asphalt plant that was on the site in the early 1970’s or from a maintenance
shop that was operated on the property in the 1940’s and 1950’s before the
Company purchased the property. The Company entered into a Consent Order with
GDNR to conduct an environmental assessment of the site and file a report of
the findings. The Company and GDOT signed an agreement to share evenly the
costs of the assessment work. The assessment report was completed and filed.
Based upon the results of the assessment report, GDOT withdrew from the cost
sharing agreement and has indicated it will not share in any future remediation
costs. The Company submitted a corrective action plan to GDNR for approval on
December 9, 2002. The Company is funding the entire cost of future
investigations and remediation which will occur over several years. Management
believes any costs incurred by the Company associated with the site will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial
condition.

In December 1998, the GDNR determined that the Company, the GDOT, and two
former asphalt plant operators are responsible parties for investigation and
remediation of groundwater contamination at the Company’s Ruby Quarry in Macon,
Georgia. The Company was designated by virtue of its ownership of the
property. GDOT was designated because it operated a testing laboratory at the
site. The two other parties were designated because both entities operated
asphalt plants at the site. The groundwater contamination was discovered when
the Company’s tenant vacated the premises and environmental testing was
conducted. The Company and GDOT signed an agreement to share the


costs of the
assessment work. The report of the assessment work was filed with the GDNR.
GDOT entered into a Consent Order with GDNR agreeing to conduct additional
testing and any necessary remediation at the site. On May 21, 2001, GDNR
issued separate Administrative Orders against the Company and other responsible
parties to require all parties to participate with GDOT to undertake additional
testing and any necessary remediation. The Company and GDOT submitted a
corrective action plan to GDNR for approval on May 20, 2002. If the Company is
required to fund the cost of remediation, the Company will pursue its right of
contribution from the responsible parties. Management believes any costs
incurred by the Company associated with the site will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial condition.

In the vicinity of and beneath the Magnesia Specialties division’s
Manistee, Michigan, facility, there is an underground plume of material
originating from adjacent property which formerly was used by Packaging
Corporation of America (“PCA”) as a part of its operations. The Company
believes the plume consists of paper mill waste. On September 8, 1983, the PCA
plume and property were listed on the National Priorities List (“NPL”) under
the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (the “Superfund” statute). The PCA plume is subject to a Record
of Decision issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”) on May
2, 1994, pursuant to which PCA (and now its successor, Pactiv Corporation
(“Pactiv”)) is required to conduct annual monitoring. The USEPA has not
required remediation of the groundwater contamination. On January 10, 2002,
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”) issued Notice of
Demand letters to the Company, PCA and Pactiv indicating that it believes that
the Company’s chloride contamination is commingling with the PCA plume which
originates upgradient from the Company’s property. The MDEQ is concerned about
possible effects of these plumes, and designated the Company, PCA and Pactiv as
parties responsible for investigation and remediation under Michigan state law.
The MDEQ held separate meetings with the Company, PCA, and Pactiv to discuss
remediation and reimbursement for past investigation costs totaling
approximately $700,000. The Company entered into an Administrative Order with
the MDEQ to pay for a portion of MDEQ’s past investigation costs and thereby
limit its liability for past costs in the amount of $20,073.62. Michigan law
provides that responsible parties are jointly and severally liable, and,
therefore, the Company is potentially liable for the full cost of funding
future investigative activities and any necessary remediation. Michigan law
also provides a procedure whereby liability may be apportioned among
responsible parties if it is capable of division. The Company believes that
the liability most likely will be apportioned and that any such costs
attributed to the Company’s brine contamination will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial condition but can
give no assurance that the liability will be apportioned or that the compliance
costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
results of the Magnesia Specialties segment’s operations.

Employees

As of March 20, 2003, the Company has approximately 6,400 employees.
Approximately 4,800 are hourly employees and approximately 1,600 are salaried
employees. Included among these employees are approximately 760 hourly
employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 12% of the Company’s
Aggregates division’s hourly employees are members of a labor union, while
approximately 98% of the Magnesia Specialties division’s hourly employees are
represented by labor unions. The Company’s principal union contracts cover
employees at the Manistee, Michigan, magnesia-based products plant and the
Woodville, Ohio, lime plant. The current Manistee collective bargaining
agreement expires in August 2003. There can be no assurance that a successor
agreement


will be reached at the Manistee location in 2003. The current
Woodville collective bargaining agreement expires in June 2006.

ITEM 2.       PROPERTIES

Aggregates

As of March 20, 2003, the Company processed or shipped aggregates from 337
quarries and distribution yards in 28 states and in Canada and the Bahamas, of
which 100 are located on land owned by the Company free of major encumbrances,
71 are on land owned in part and leased in part, 149 are on leased land, and 17
are on facilities neither owned nor leased, where raw materials are removed
under an agreement. The Company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60
years of production, based on current levels of activity. However, certain
locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to
expand. In addition, the Company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete
and/or asphalt products from 25 properties in 5 states, of which 12 are located
on land owned by the Company free of major encumbrances, 2 are on land owned in
part and leased in part, and 11 are on leased land.

Magnesia Specialties

The Magnesia Specialties division currently operates a major manufacturing
facility in Manistee, Michigan, and smaller processing plants in Bridgeport,
Connecticut, and Lenoir City, Tennessee. All of these facilities are owned,
except Lenoir City, which is leased. The Company has also entered into several
third-party toll-manufacturing agreements pursuant to which it processes
various chemical products. In addition, in 2001 the Company transferred
operating responsibility for its Woodville, Ohio dolomitic lime operation from
its Magnesia Specialties division to the Mid-America


Division of its Aggregates
division, but the Woodville, Ohio operations will continue to be reported by
the Company within the Magnesia Specialties segment. The Woodville, Ohio
facilities are owned.

Other Properties

The Company’s principal corporate office, which it owns, is located in
Raleigh, North Carolina. The Company owns and leases various administrative
offices and research and development laboratories for its two reportable
business segments and other related businesses. The Company also leases a
plant in Sparta, North Carolina, which the Company is currently fitting up to
serve as an assembly plant for its structural composites business.

The Company’s principal properties, which are of varying ages and are of
different construction types, are believed to be generally in good condition,
are generally well maintained, and are generally suitable and adequate for the
purposes for which they are used. The principal properties are believed to be
utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 80% and are capable
of supporting a higher level of market demand.

ITEM 3.       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time claims of various types are asserted against the Company
arising out of its operations in the normal course of business, including
claims relating to land use and permits, safety, health, and environmental
matters (such as noise abatement, vibrations, air emissions, and water
discharges). Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and it is not
possible to determine the probable outcome of, or the amount of liability, if
any, from, these matters. In the opinion of management of the Company (which
opinion is based in part upon consideration of the opinion of counsel), it is
unlikely that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s operations or its financial condition. However, there can be
no assurance that an adverse outcome in any of such litigation would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company or its operating segments.

the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange


Act of
1934. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve
risks and uncertainties, and are based on assumptions that the Company believes
in good faith are reasonable, but which may be materially different from actual
results.

Factors that the Company currently believes could cause its actual results
to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but
are not limited to, business and economic conditions and trends in the markets

Form 10-K.

ITEM 14.       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of December 31, 2002, an evaluation was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
2002. There have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal
controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
subsequent to December 31, 2002.

For these purposes, “disclosure controls and procedures” are controls and
other procedures of the Company that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in its reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), such as this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. The Company’s internal controls are procedures designed
with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that the Company’s
transactions are properly authorized, its assets are safeguarded against
unauthorized or improper use, and its transactions are properly recorded and
reported, all to permit the preparation of the Company’s financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that
the Company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These


inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some
persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the
control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur
and not be detected.

Appearing immediately following the Signatures section of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K are forms of “Certifications” of the Company’s CEO and CFO
as required in accord with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
“Section 302 Certification”). The Section 302 Certifications refer to this
evaluation of the Company’s disclosure policies and procedures. The
information in this section should be read in conjunction with the Section 302
Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.
