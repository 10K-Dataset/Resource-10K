General

Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the “Company”) is a leading supplier of aggregates products (crushed stone, sand, and gravel) for
the construction industry, used for the construction of infrastructure, nonresidential, and residential projects. In addition, aggregates products are used for railroad ballast and in agricultural, utility and environmental applications. The
Company’s Aggregates business consists primarily of mining, processing, and selling granite, limestone, sand and gravel. The Aggregates business also includes its aggregates-related downstream product lines (including its heavy building
materials such as asphalt products, ready mixed concrete, and road paving construction services). The Company’s Cement business produces Portland and specialty cements. The Company also has a Magnesia Specialties business that manufactures and
markets magnesia-based chemical products used in industrial, agricultural, and environmental applications, and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry. In 2015, the Company’s Aggregates business accounted for 82% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales, the Company’s Cement business accounted for 11% of the Company’s consolidated net sales, and the Company’s Magnesia Specialties business accounted for 7% of the Company’s consolidated net
sales. Within the Company’s Aggregates business, the aggregates product line accounted for 67% of 2015 net sales, while the aggregates-related downstream operations accounted for 33% of 2015 net sales.

The Company was formed in 1993 as a North Carolina corporation to serve as successor to the operations of the materials group of the
organization that is now Lockheed Martin Corporation. An initial public offering of a portion of the Company’s Common Stock was completed in 1994, followed by a tax-free exchange transaction in 1996 that resulted in 100% of the Company’s
Common Stock being publicly traded.

The Company completed over 80 smaller acquisitions from the time of its initial public offering until
the present, which allowed the Company to enhance and expand its presence in the aggregates marketplace. The Company uses its ability to distribute materials over long distances by rail and water to further expand its operations.

The business has developed further through the following transactions over the past five years. In 2011, the Company acquired three
aggregates-related businesses. First, it acquired the assets of an aggregates, asphalt, and ready mixed concrete business located in western San Antonio, Texas. Second, it exchanged certain assets with Lafarge North America Inc.
(“Lafarge”), pursuant to which it received aggregate quarry sites, ready mixed concrete and asphalt plants, and a road paving business in and around the metropolitan Denver, Colorado, region, in exchange for which Lafarge received
properties consisting of quarries, an asphalt plant, and distribution yards operated by the Company along the Mississippi River (referred to herein as the Company’s “River District Operations”) and a cash payment. Finally, the Company
acquired a privately-held ready mixed concrete business in the Denver, Colorado area.

In 2013, the Company acquired three aggregates
quarries in the greater Atlanta, Georgia area. The transaction provided over 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves and enhanced the Company’s existing long-term position in this market.



In 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Texas Industries, Inc. (“TXI”),
further augmenting its position as a leading supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials. TXI, as a stand-alone entity, was a leading supplier of heavy construction materials in the southwestern United States and a major supplier of natural
aggregates and ready-mixed concrete in Texas, northern Louisiana and, to a lesser extent, in Oklahoma and Arkansas. TXI was the largest supplier of construction aggregates, ready mixed concrete, concrete products, and cement in Texas. Now as a
wholly-owned subsidiary, TXI enhances the Company’s position as an aggregates-led, low-cost operator in the large and fast-growing geographies in the United States and provides high-quality assets in cement and ready mixed concrete.

In addition to the Cement business, the Company acquired as part of the TXI acquisition nine quarries and six aggregates distribution
terminals located in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. The Company also acquired approximately 120 ready mixed concrete plants, situated primarily in three areas of Texas (the Dallas/Fort Worth/Denton area of north Texas; the Austin area of central
Texas; and from Beaumont to Texarkana in east Texas), in north and central Louisiana, and in Southwestern Arkansas. The aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations are reported in the Company’s West Group of its Aggregates business. As part
of an agreement with the United States Department of Justice’s review of the transaction, the Company divested of its North Troy Quarry in Oklahoma and two related rail distribution yards in Dallas and Frisco, Texas.

TXI was also a major cement producer in California. In 2015, the Company divested its California cement business acquired from TXI. These
operations were not in close proximity to other core assets of the Company and, unlike other marketplace competitors, were not vertically integrated with ready mixed concrete production. The divestiture primarily included a cement plant, two
distribution terminals, mobile equipment, intangible assets, and inventory. The Company also completed the integration of the TXI operations in 2015, and completed three smaller acquisitions, which included three aggregate operations and related
assets.

Between 2001 and 2015, the Company disposed of or idled a number of underperforming operations, including aggregates, asphalt,
ready mixed concrete, trucking, and road paving operations of its Aggregates business and the refractories business of its Magnesia Specialties business. In some of its divestitures, the Company concurrently entered into supply agreements to provide
aggregates at market rates to certain of these divested businesses. During 2015, the Company disposed of certain non-core asphalt operations in San Antonio, Texas. The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to divest underperforming assets
during 2016 in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities.

Business Segment Information

The Company conducts its Aggregates business through three reportable segments: the Mid-America Group, Southeast Group, and West Group. The
Company’s Cement business is reported through the Cement segment. The Company also has the Magnesia Specialties segment, which includes its magnesia-based chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses. Information concerning the Company’s total
revenues, net sales, gross profit, earnings from operations, assets employed, and certain additional information attributable to each reportable business segment for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 is included in
“Note O: Business Segments” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” of the Company’s 2015 consolidated financial statements (the “2015 Financial Statements”), which are included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K,
and are part of the Company’s 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders (the “2015 Annual Report”), which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Aggregates Business



The Aggregates business mines, processes and sells granite, limestone, sand, gravel, and other
aggregate products for use in all sectors of the public infrastructure, nonresidential and residential construction industries, as well as agriculture, railroad ballast, chemical, and other uses. The Aggregates business also includes the operation
of other construction materials businesses. These businesses, located in the West Group, were acquired through continued selective vertical integration by the Company, and include asphalt, ready mixed concrete, and road paving operations in
Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Texas, and Wyoming.

The Company is a leading supplier of aggregates for the construction industry in the
United States. In 2015, the Company’s Aggregates business shipped and delivered aggregates, asphalt products, and ready mixed concrete from a network of over 400 quarries, underground mines, distribution facilities, and plants to customers in
36 states, Canada, and the Bahamas, generating net sales and earnings from operations of $2.7 billion and $429.0 million, respectively.

The Aggregates and Cement businesses market their products primarily to the construction industry, with approximately 42% of the aggregates
product line shipments made to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments made primarily to contractors in connection with nonresidential and residential construction projects.
The Company believes public-works projects have historically accounted for approximately 50% of the total annual aggregates and cement consumption in the United States. These businesses benefit from public-works construction projects. As a result of
dependence upon the construction industry, the profitability of aggregates and cement producers is sensitive to national, regional, and local economic conditions, and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, which is affected by
fluctuations in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, and changes in the level of infrastructure spending funded by the public sector.

The Company’s aggregates product line shipments have increased each of the past four years, reflecting a certain degree of volume
stability and modest growth, albeit at and from historically low levels. Prior to 2011, the economic recession resulted in United States aggregates consumption declining by almost 40% from peak volumes in 2006. Aggregates shipments had also suffered
as states continued to balance their construction spending with the uncertainty related to long-term federal highway funding and budget shortfalls caused by decreasing tax revenues. During 2015, the Company’s heritage aggregates shipments
increased 2.1% compared with 2014 levels, despite the impact of historic levels of rainfall in many of the Company’s markets. Most state budgets began to improve starting in 2013 as increased tax revenues helped states resolve or begin to
resolve budget deficits.

The federal highway bill provides annual funding for public-sector highway construction projects. After a decade
of 36 short-term funding provisions since

Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21

st

Century

(“MAP-21”) expired, a five-year, $305 billion highway bill,

Fixing America’s
Surface Transportation Act

(the “FAST Act”), was signed into law on December 4, 2015. FAST Act funding will primarily be secured through gas tax collections. In an investigation performed by S-C Market Analytics, aggregate demand
is projected to increase with the availability of federal funding and is expected to peak in 2018. However, we believe that in subsequent years, the projected demand for aggregates will decline with anticipated higher interest and inflation rates.
Additionally, many states have recently shown a commitment to securing alternative funding sources, including initiating special-purpose taxes and raising gas taxes. According to

American Road and Transportation Builders Association

(“ARTBA”), fifteen states have raised gas taxes and 30 legislative measures (which represented 68% of ballot initiatives) for transportation funding were approved by voters in 2015. Supported by state-spending programs, the
Company’s heritage aggregates volumes to the infrastructure market in the eastern United States increased in the mid-single digits in 2015 compared with 2014. Overall, the infrastructure market accounted for approximately 42% of the
Company’s 2015 aggregates product line shipments.



The FAST Act will reauthorize federal highway and public transportation programs and stabilize
the Highway Trust Fund. $207.4 billion of the funding will be apportioned to the states by formula, with a 5.1% increase over actual fiscal year 2015 apportionments in 2016 and then inflationary increases in subsequent years. Meaningful impact from
the FAST Act is not expected before the second half of 2016.

The FAST Act retains the programs supported under the predecessor bill,

MAP-21

, but with some changes. Specifically, TIFIA, a U.S. Department of Transportation alternative funding mechanism, which under MAP-21 provided three types of federal credit assistance for nationally or regionally significant surface
transportation projects, will now allow more diversification of projects. TIFIA is designed to fill market gaps and leverage substantial private co-investment by providing projects with supplemental or subordinate debt that is not subject to
national debt ceiling challenges or sequestration. Since 2012, TIFIA has provided credit assistance to over 30 projects representing over $49 billion in infrastructure investment. Under the FAST Act, TIFIA annual funding will range from $275 million
to $300 million, and will no longer require the 20% matching funds from state departments of transportation. Consequently, states can advance construction projects immediately with potentially zero upfront outlay of local state department of
transportation dollars. TIFIA requires projects to have a revenue source to pay back the credit assistance within a 30 to 40 year period. Moreover, TIFIA funds may represent up to 49% of total eligible project costs for a TIFIA-secured loan and 33%
for a TIFIA standby line of credit. Therefore, the TIFIA program has the ability to significantly leverage construction dollars. Each dollar of federal funds can provide up to $10 in TIFIA credit assistance and support up to $30 in transportation
infrastructure investment. Private investment in transportation projects funded through the TIFIA program is particularly attractive, in part due to the subordination of public investment to private. Management believes TIFIA could provide a
substantial boost for state department of transportation construction programs well above what is currently budgeted. As of January 2016, TIFIA funded projects for the Company’s key states (Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida)
exceeded $12 billion.

The federal highway bill provides spending authorizations, which represent the maximum financial obligation that
will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs. The federal government’s surface transportation programs are financed mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the Highway
Trust Fund, which is divided into the Highway Account and the Mass Transit Account. Revenues credited to the Highway Trust Fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax, a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the
accounts’ accumulated balances. MAP-21 extended federal motor fuel taxes through September 30, 2016 and truck excise taxes through September 30, 2017. Of the currently imposed federal gas tax of $0.184 per gallon, which has been
static since 1993, $0.15 is allocated to the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund.

Transportation investments generally boost the
national economy by enhancing mobility and access and by creating jobs, which is a priority of many of the government’s economic plans. According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 billion in federal highway investment creates
approximately 28,000 jobs. The number of jobs created is dependent on the nature and aggregates intensity of the projects. Approximately half of the Aggregates business’ net sales to the infrastructure market come from federal funding
authorizations, including matching funds from the states. For each dollar spent on road, highway and bridge improvements, the Federal Highway Administration estimates an average benefit of $5.20 is recognized in the form of reduced vehicle
maintenance costs, reduced delays, reduced fuel consumption, improved safety, reduced road and bridge maintenance costs and reduced emissions as a result of improved traffic flow.

The Company’s Aggregates business covers a wide geographic area. The Company’s five largest revenue-generating states (Texas,
Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa, and Georgia) accounted for 70% of total 2015 net sales for the Aggregates business by state of destination. The Company’s Aggregates business is



accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time. Recent improvements in the
national economy and in some of the states in which the Company operates have led to improvements in profitability in the Company’s Aggregates business.

The Company’s Aggregates business is also highly seasonal, due primarily to the effect of weather conditions on construction activity
within its markets. The operations of the Aggregates business that are concentrated in the northern and midwestern United States and Canada typically experience more severe winter weather conditions than operations in the southeastern and
southwestern regions of the United States. Excessive rainfall, flooding, or severe drought can also jeopardize shipments, production, and profitability in all of the Company’s markets. Subject to these factors, the Company’s second and
third quarters are typically the strongest, with the first quarter generally reflecting the weakest results. Results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the Company’s annual results. Similarly, the operations of the Aggregates
business in the coastal areas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September, and October, and have experienced weather-related losses from time to time. Weather-related hindrances were exacerbated in 2015 by record
precipitation in many of the Company’s key markets. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) has tracked precipitation for 121 years. According to NOAA, 2015 represented the wettest year on record for Texas and
Oklahoma, while North Carolina, South Carolina, Colorado and Iowa each experienced a top-ten precipitation year, and the nation as a whole had its third wettest year in NOAA recorded history. These weather events reduced the Company’s overall
profitability in 2015, creating a backlog of construction activity expected to be completed in 2016. The completion of construction activity backlog in 2016 will depend on the capacity of the affected areas to provide enough resources, such as
construction crews and equipment, among others.

Natural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain
areas of the United States. As a general rule, truck shipments from an individual quarry are limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself. As described below, the
Company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks, but also has access to a river barge and ocean vessel network where the per mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower. In addition, acquisitions have enabled the Company to extend
its customer base through increased access to rail transportation. Proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to long-haul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses.

A significant percentage of the Company’s aggregates shipments continue to be moved by rail or water through a distribution yard network.
In 1994, 93% of the Company’s aggregates shipments were moved by truck, the rest by rail. In contrast, in 2015, the originating mode of transportation for the Company’s aggregates shipments was 75% by truck, 21% by rail, and 4% by water.
Although the Company divested its River District Operations in 2011 as part of the asset exchange with Lafarge, the development of deep-water and rail distribution yards continues to be a key component of the Company’s strategic growth plan.
While the River District Operations were being serviced as part of the Company’s barge long-haul distribution network, those divested operations were not in high-growth states. The majority of rail and water movements occur in the Southeast
Group and the West Group, that have certain areas which generally lack a long-term indigenous supply of coarse aggregates but exhibit above-average growth characteristics driven by long-term population growth and density. The Company has an
extensive network of aggregate quarries and distribution centers throughout the southern United States and in the Bahamas and Canada, as well as distribution centers along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. In 2015, 24.3 million tons of
aggregates were sold from distribution yards. Results from these distribution operations lowered the gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) of the Aggregates business by 240 basis points in 2015. The gross margin (excluding freight
and delivery



revenues) of the Aggregates business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins of the long-haul distribution network.

During the recent economic recession, the Company set a priority of preserving capital while maintaining safe, environmentally-sound
operations. As the Company returns to a more normalized operating environment, management expects to focus part of its capital spending program on expanding key Southeast and Southwest operations.

The Company’s Medina Rock and Rail capital project, with a total cost of $160 million, is the largest capital expansion project in its
history. The project, located near San Antonio, Texas, consists of a rail-connected limestone aggregates processing facility which is expected to ship approximately six million tons in 2016 and have the future capability of producing in excess of
10 million tons per year. Land acquisitions were completed over several years as part of ongoing capital expenditures, and construction began in 2013. The project began operations in January 2016.

The Company also acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations. This property can serve as buffer property or additional
mineral reserve capacity, assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining. In either instance, the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of
quarry life. Some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand.

A long-term capital focus for the Company, primarily in the
midwestern United States due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply, is underground limestone aggregate mines, which provide a neighbor-friendly alternative to surface quarries. The Company operates 14 active underground mines, located
primarily in the Mid-America Group, and is the largest operator of underground limestone aggregate mines in the United States. Production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregate deposits
and the access to the reserves result in higher development, explosives and depreciation costs. However, these locations often possess transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries.

The Company’s acquisitions and capital projects have expanded its ability to ship material by rail, as discussed in more detail below.
The Company has added additional capacity in a number of locations that can now accommodate larger unit train movements. These expansion projects have enhanced the Company’s long-haul distribution network. The Company’s process improvement
efforts have also improved operational effectiveness through plant automation, mobile fleet modernization, right-sizing, and other cost control improvements. Accordingly, the Company has enhanced its reach through its ability to provide
cost-effective coverage of coastal markets on the east and gulf coasts, as well as geographic areas that can be accessed economically by the Company’s expanded distribution system. This distribution network moves aggregates materials from
domestic and offshore sources, via rail and water, to markets where aggregates supply is limited.

As the Company continues to move more
aggregates by rail and water, internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margins (excluding freight and delivery revenues). This typically occurs where the Company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location
by rail or water, and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component. Margins are negatively affected because the Company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the
selling price of the materials. Moreover, the Company’s expansion of its rail-based distribution network, coupled with the extensive use of rail service in the Southeast and West Groups, increases the Company’s dependence on and exposure
to railroad performance, including track congestion, crew availability, and power availability, and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts. The waterborne distribution



network, primarily located within the Southeast Group, also increases the Company’s exposure to certain risks, including the ability to negotiate favorable shipping contracts, demurrage
costs, fuel costs, ship availability, and weather disruptions. The Company has entered into long-term agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport the Company’s aggregates to various coastal ports.

The Company’s long-term shipping contracts are generally take-or-pay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements. If the
Company fails to ship the annual minimum tonnages under the agreement, it must still pay the shipping company the contractually-stated minimum amount for that year. In 2015, the Company did not incur any such charges; however, a charge is possible
in 2016 if shipment volumes do not meet the contractually-stated minimums.

From time to time, the Company has experienced rail
transportation shortages, particularly in the Southwest and Southeast. These shortages were caused by the downsizing in personnel and equipment by certain railroads during economic downturns. Further, in response to these issues, rail transportation
providers focused on increasing the number of cars per unit train under transportation contracts and are generally requiring customers, through the freight rate structure, to accommodate larger unit train movements. A unit train is a freight train
moving large tonnages of a single bulk product between two points without intermediate yarding and switching. Certain of the Company’s sales yards have the system capabilities to meet the unit train requirements. Over the last few years, the
Company has made capital improvements to a number of its sales yards in order to better accommodate unit train unloadings. Rail availability is seasonal and can impact aggregates shipments depending on competing movements.

From time to time, we have also experienced rail and trucking shortages due to competition from other products. For example, in Texas,
competition with operations in the oil and gas fields for third-party trucking services constrains the availability of these services to us. If there are material changes in the availability or cost of rail or trucking services, we may not be able
to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products at a reasonable cost, which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs.

The Company’s management expects the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and via deep-water
ships should provide the Company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the United States.

The construction aggregates industry has been consolidating, and the Company has actively participated in the consolidation of the industry.
When acquired, new locations sometimes do not satisfy the Company’s internal safety, maintenance, and pit development standards, and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized. Industry consolidation
slowed several years ago as the number of suitable small to mid-sized acquisition targets in high-growth markets declined. During that period of fewer acquisition opportunities, the Company focused on investing in internal expansion projects in
high-growth markets. The number of acquisition opportunities has increased in the last few years as the economy has begun to recover from the protracted recession. Opportunities include public and larger private, family-owned businesses, as well as
asset swaps and divestitures from companies rationalizing non-core assets and repairing financially-constrained balanced sheets. The Company’s Board of Directors and management continue to review and monitor the Company’s strategic
long-term plans, which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses, increasing market share in the Company’s core businesses, investing in internal expansion projects in
high-growth markets, and pursuing new opportunities related to the Company’s existing markets.

The Company became more vertically
integrated with an acquisition in 1998 and subsequent acquisitions, including the 2014 TXI acquisition, particularly in the West Group, pursuant to which the



Company acquired asphalt, ready mixed concrete, paving construction, trucking, and other businesses, which complement the Company’s aggregates operations. These aggregates-related downstream
operations accounted for 33% of net sales of the Aggregates business in 2015. These aggregates-related downstream operations reported within the Aggregates business segment have lower gross margins (excluding freight and delivery revenues) than the
Company’s aggregates product line due to highly competitive market dynamics and lower barriers to entry, and are affected by volatile factors, including fuel costs, operating efficiencies, and weather, to an even greater extent than the
Company’s aggregates operations. Liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete, respectively. Therefore, fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the
Company’s operating results. During 2015, prices for liquid asphalt were lower than 2014. Liquid asphalt prices may not always follow other energy products (e.g., oil or diesel fuel) because of complexities in the refining process which
converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products. We expect the Company’s gross margins (excluding freight and delivery revenues) for the legacy TXI aggregates-related downstream operations to improve, similar to the pattern
experienced at the Colorado aggregates-related downstream operations acquired in 2011.

The Company continues to review carefully each of
the acquired aggregates-related downstream operations to determine if they represent opportunities to divest underperforming assets in an effort to redeploy capital for other opportunities. The Company also reviews other independent
aggregates-related downstream operations to determine if they might present attractive acquisition opportunities in the best interest of the Company, either as part of their own aggregates-related downstream operations or operations that might be
vertically integrated with other operations owned by the Company. Based on these assessments, in 2011 the Company completed the acquisitions described under

General

above, which included aggregates-related downstream operations, including
asphalt, ready mixed concrete, and road paving businesses in the Denver, Colorado, and San Antonio, Texas markets. The 2014 business combination with TXI described under

General

above further expanded the Company’s aggregates-related
downstream operations, with the addition of TXI’s aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations. The TXI combination also added the cement operations of TXI, which are accounted for as a separate business segment of the Company.

Environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to
develop new quarry operations. Although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal, state, and local governmental bodies regarding these matters, the Company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make
zoning and permitting more difficult, thereby potentially enhancing the value of the Company’s existing mineral reserves.

Management
believes the Aggregates business’ raw materials, or aggregates reserves, are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future. The Company does not anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining the raw
materials that it uses for current production in its Aggregates business. The Company’s aggregates reserves on the average exceed 60 years of production, based on normalized levels of production. However, certain locations may be subject to
more limited reserves and may not be able to expand. Moreover, as noted above, environmental and zoning regulations will likely make it harder for the Company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations. The Company generally
sells products in its Aggregates business upon receipt of orders or requests from customers. Accordingly, there is no significant order backlog. The Company generally maintains inventories of aggregate products in sufficient quantities to meet the
requirements of customers.

Less than 2% of the revenues from the Aggregates business are from foreign jurisdictions, principally Canada
and the Bahamas, with revenues from customers in foreign countries totaling $12.3 million, $13.0 million, and $16.8 million, during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.



Cement Business

The Cement business produces Portland and specialty cements. Cement is the basic binding agent for concrete, a primary construction material.
The principal raw material used in the production of cement is calcium carbonate in the form of limestone. The Company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its two cement production plants in Texas. Similar to the
Aggregates business, cement is used in infrastructure projects, nonresidential and residential construction, and the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries. Consequently, the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the
strength of the construction sector.

The Company has the leading cement position in Texas, with two production facilities, one located in
Midlothian, Texas, south of Dallas/Fort Worth, and the other located in Hunter, Texas, north of San Antonio. In addition to these production facilities, the Company also operates three cement distribution terminals in Texas. During 2015 the Company
also operated a state-of-the-art, rail-located cement plant in southern California at Oro Grande, California, near Los Angeles, California, and operated cement grinding and packaging facilities at the Crestmore plant near Riverside, California. In
addition to the manufacturing and packaging facilities, the Company also operated two cement distribution terminals in California in 2015. As of September 30, 2015, the Company sold all of its California cement operations. It retained the
real estate at the Crestmore facility, which the Company expects to sell for non-cement use. These operations were not in close proximity to other core assets of the Company and, unlike other marketplace competitors, were not vertically integrated
with ready mixed concrete production.

Cement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions. According to
the Portland Cement Association, nearly two-thirds of U.S. cement consumption occurs in the six months between May and October. The majority of all cement shipments, approximately 70 percent, are sent to ready-mix concrete operators. The rest
are shipped to manufacturers of concrete related products, contractors, materials dealers, oil well/mining/drilling companies, as well as government entities.

Energy, including electricity and fossil fuels, accounts for approximately one-third of the cement production cost profile. Therefore,
profitability of the Cement business is affected by changes in energy prices and the availability of the supply of these products. The Company currently has fixed-price supply contracts for coal and diesel fuel but also consumes natural gas,
alternative fuel and petroleum coke. Further, profitability of the Cement business is also subject to kiln maintenance. This process typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made. In 2015, the Cement business
incurred ordinary kiln maintenance shutdown costs of $26.0 million.

Texas and California accounted for 73% and 27% of the Cement
business’ net sales, respectively, in 2015, including the California cement operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Cement business is benefitting from continued strength in the Texas markets, where current demand
exceeds local supply, a trend that is expected to continue for the near future. The Cement business sold cement to customers in 13 states and Mexico. Truck and rail transportation modes represent 97% and 3%, respectively, of total tons shipped. A
portion of the cement is used internally in the Company’s ready mixed concrete product line. The Company shipped a total of 4.6 million tons of cement in 2015, with 3.7 million tons shipped to external customers and 0.9 million
tons consumed by the Company for internal use. Of this amount, 1.1 million tons were shipped from the California cement plant prior to its sale as of September 30, 2015. For 2015 the Cement business generated net sales and earnings from
operations of $367.6 million and $47.8 million, respectively.



The limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on property, owned by the
Company, adjacent to each of the cement plants. Management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future.

The Cement business generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers. Accordingly, there are no significant
levels of order backlog. Inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers

.

Less than 2% of the revenues from the Cement business are from foreign jurisdictions, principally Mexico, with revenues from customers in
foreign countries totaling $0.4 million during 2015 and $3.8 million during 2014 for the period from the July 1, 2014 acquisition of TXI.

Magnesia Specialties Business

The
Company manufactures and markets, through its Magnesia Specialties business, magnesia-based chemical products for industrial, agricultural, and environmental applications, and dolomitic lime for use primarily in the steel industry. These chemical
products have varying uses, including flame retardants, wastewater treatment, pulp and paper production, and other environmental applications. In 2015, 67% of Magnesia Specialties’ net sales were attributable to chemical products, 32% to lime,
and 1% to stone sold as construction materials. Magnesia Specialties’ net sales declined 3.6% in 2015 compared with 2014. The reduction reflects a decrease in both the chemicals and dolomitic lime product lines. Net sales were impacted by lower
domestic steel production, which was down 9% versus 2014. For 2015 the Magnesia Specialties business generated net sales and earnings from operations of $227.5 million and $68.9 million, respectively.

Given the high fixed costs associated with operating this business, low capacity utilization negatively affects its results of operations. A
significant portion of the costs related to the production of magnesia-based products and dolomitic lime is of a fixed or semi-fixed nature. In addition, the production of certain magnesia chemical products and lime products requires natural gas,
coal, and petroleum coke to fuel kilns. Price fluctuations of these fuels affect the profitability of this business.

In 2015, 80% of the
lime produced was sold to third-party customers, while the remaining 20% was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products. Dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel
industry. Products used in the steel industry, either directly as dolomitic lime or indirectly as a component of other industrial products, accounted for 42% of the Magnesia Specialties’ net sales in 2015, attributable primarily to the sale of
dolomitic lime products. Accordingly, a portion of the profitability of the Magnesia Specialties business is dependent on steel production capacity utilization and the related marketplace. These trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption,
the flow of offshore imports, and other economic factors. The dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70% or greater steel capacity utilization; domestic capacity utilization averaged 70% in 2015, according to the American Iron and Steel
Institute. Average steel production in 2015 declined 9% versus 2014 and the 2016 forecast is an increase of 2% over 2015.

Management has
shifted the strategic focus of the magnesia-based business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations. Accordingly, that business is not as dependent on the steel industry as is the dolomitic lime
portion of the Magnesia Specialties business.

The principal raw materials used in the Magnesia Specialties business are dolomitic
limestone and alkali-rich brine. Management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future.



After the brine is used in the production process, the Magnesia Specialties business must dispose
of the processed brine. In the past, the business did this by reinjecting the processed brine back into its underground brine reserve network around its facility in Manistee, Michigan. The business has also sold a portion of this processed brine to
third parties. In 2003, Magnesia Specialties entered into a long-term processed brine supply agreement with The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) pursuant to which Dow purchases processed brine from Magnesia Specialties, at market rates, for
use in Dow’s production of calcium chloride products. Magnesia Specialties also entered into a venture with Dow to construct, own, and operate a processed brine supply pipeline between the Magnesia Specialties facility in Manistee, Michigan,
and Dow’s facility in Ludington, Michigan. Construction of the pipeline was completed in 2003, and Dow began purchasing processed brine from Magnesia Specialties through the pipeline. In 2010, Dow sold the assets of Dow’s facility in
Ludington, Michigan to Occidental Chemical Corporation (“Occidental”) and assigned to Occidental its interests in the long-term processed brine supply agreement and the pipeline venture with Magnesia Specialties.

Magnesia Specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of orders or requests from customers. Accordingly, there is no significant
order backlog. Inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers. A significant portion of the 275,000 ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln completed in 2012 at
Woodville, Ohio is committed under a long-term supply contract.

The Magnesia Specialties business is highly dependent on rail
transportation, particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from Woodville to Manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both Woodville and Manistee. The segment can be affected by the specific
transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under Item IA., Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.

Approximately 13.3% of the
revenues of the Magnesia Specialties business in 2015 were from foreign jurisdictions, principally Canada, Mexico, Europe, South America, and the Pacific Rim, but no single foreign country accounted for 10% or more of the revenues of the business.
Revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled $32.7 million, $29.0 million, and $25.7 million, in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. As a result of these foreign market sales, the financial results of the Magnesia Specialties business could
be affected by foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets. To mitigate the short-term effects of currency exchange rates, the Magnesia Specialties business principally uses the United States dollar as the
functional currency in foreign transactions. However, the current strength of the United States dollar in foreign markets is affecting the overall price of Magnesia Specialties’ products when compared to foreign-domiciled competitors.

Patents and Trademarks

As of
February 12, 2016, the Company owns, has the right to use, or has pending applications for approximately 33 patents pending or granted by the United States and various countries and approximately 112 trademarks related to business. The Company
believes that its rights under its existing patents, patent applications, and trademarks are of value to its operations, but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the Company’s business as a
whole.

Customers

No material
part of the business of any segment of the Company is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers, the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment. The Company’s products are sold principally to
commercial customers in private industry. Although large amounts



of construction materials are used in public works projects, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county, or municipal governments, or agencies thereof.

Competition

Because of the impact
of transportation costs on the aggregates industry, competition in the Aggregates business tends to be limited to producers in proximity to each of the Company’s facilities. Although all of the Company’s locations experience competition,
the Company believes that it is generally a leading producer in the areas it serves. Competition is based primarily on quarry or distribution location and price, but quality of aggregates and level of customer service are also factors.

There are over 5,600 companies in the United States that produce construction aggregates. These include active crushed stone companies and
active sand and gravel companies. The largest ten producers account for approximately 35% of the total market. The Company’s aggregates-related downstream operations are also characterized by numerous operators. A national trade association
estimates there are about 5,500 ready mixed concrete plants in the United States owned by over 2,200 companies, with about 65,000 mixer trucks delivering ready mixed concrete. Similarly, a national trade association estimates there are about 3,700
asphalt plants in the United States owned by over 800 companies. The Company, in its Aggregates business, including its aggregates-related downstream operations, competes with a number of other large and small producers. The Company believes that
its ability to transport materials by ocean vessels and rail have enhanced the Company’s ability to compete in the aggregates industry. Some of the Company’s competitors in the aggregates industry have greater financial resources than the
Company.

The Company’s Magnesia Specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas
principally on the basis of quality, price, technological advances, and technical support for its products. The Magnesia Specialties business also competes for sales to customers located outside the United States, with revenues from foreign
jurisdictions accounting for 13.3% of revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business in 2015, principally in Canada, Mexico, Europe, South America, and the Pacific Rim. Certain of the Company’s competitors in the Magnesia Specialties business
have greater financial resources than the Company.

According to the Portland Cement Association, United States cement production is
widely dispersed with the operation of 107 cement plants in 36 states. The top five companies collectively operate 49.6 percent of U.S. clinker capacity with the largest company representing 14.2 percent of all domestic clinker capacity. An
estimated 76.7 percent of U.S. clinker capacity is owned by companies headquartered outside of the United States. In reviewing these figures for cement plants, capacity is often stated in terms of “clinker” capacity. “Clinker” is
the initial product of cement production. Cement producers mine materials such as limestone, shale, or other materials, crush and screen the materials, and place them in a cement kiln. After being heated to extremely high temperatures, these
materials form marble-sized balls or pellets called “clinker” that are then very finely ground to produce portland cement.

The
Company’s Cement business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of proximity, quality and price for its products, but level of customer service is also a factor. The Cement business
also competes with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports in some of our markets. A small percentage of the Company’s cement sales are to customers located outside the United States, with
less than 2% of revenues for the Cement business in 2015 coming from sales from California to customers in Mexico. The Company divested of its California cement business as of September 30, 2015. Certain of the Company’s competitors in the
Cement business have greater financial resources than the Company.



The nature of the Company’s competition varies among its product lines due to the widely
differing amounts of capital necessary to build production facilities. Crushed stone production from stone quarries or mines, or sand and gravel production by dredging, is moderately capital intensive. The Company’s major competitors in the
aggregates markets are typically large vertically integrated companies, with international operations. Ready-mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks. As a
result, in each local market the Company faces competition from numerous small producers as well as large vertically integrated companies with facilities in many markets. Construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and
requires long lead times to complete engineering design, obtain regulatory permits, acquire equipment and construct a plant. Most domestic producers of cement are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets. Many of
these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities.

Research and Development

The Company conducts research and development activities, principally for its magnesia-based chemicals business, at its plant in Manistee,
Michigan. In general, the Company’s research and development efforts are directed to applied technological development for the use of its chemicals products. The amounts spent by the Company in each of the last two years on research and
development activities were not material.

Environmental and Governmental Regulations

The Company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health
and safety, and other regulatory matters. Certain of the Company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations.
Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Company’s operations, and such permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation.

The Company records an accrual for environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. The accruals are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or
potential gains from future alternative uses for a site.

The Company regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures, and
policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies, new laws that are adopted, and new laws that the Company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations.
The Company has a full time staff of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities. The direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately $24.7 million in 2015 and approximately $19.6 million in 2014 and
are related to the Company’s environmental staff, ongoing monitoring costs for various matters (including those matters disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and asset retirement costs. Capitalized costs related to environmental
control facilities were approximately $9.7 million in 2015 and are expected to be approximately $9.0 million in 2016 and 2017. The Company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or
financial condition in 2015 and 2014. However, our expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future. Despite our compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the
operation of the Company’s businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses, and



there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the Company in the future.

Many of the requirements of the environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the Company adopts as best business practices in the
ordinary course of its operations. For example, plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may, as an ordinary course of operations, have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone. The water spray bar also suffices
as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws. The Company does not break out the portion of the cost, depreciation, and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is only attributable to
environmental purposes, as it would be derived from an arbitrary allocation methodology. The incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating practices is impractical to
quantify. Accordingly, the Company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses.

The environmental accruals
recorded by the Company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal, state, and/or local environmental protection laws. Many of these laws and the
regulations promulgated under them are complex, and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts from time to time. In addition, new laws are adopted from time to time. It is often difficult to accurately and fully
quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined the type of operations to which they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined. This process often takes years to finalize and changes
significantly from the time the rules are proposed to the time they are final. The Company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements, which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that
may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs.

Management believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable, although those amounts may increase or decrease depending
on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances. The Company believes that any additional costs for ongoing environmental compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s obligations or financial condition.

Future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and
management’s experience and knowledge in the industry, and are discounted to their present value using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate of interest. The future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries. For additional
information regarding compliance with legal requirements, see “Note N: Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” of the 2015 Financial Statements and the 2015 Annual Report. The Company is generally
required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use. The Company performs activities on an ongoing basis that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligation. These activities are
performed as an integral part of the normal quarrying process. For example, the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization. This sloping and benching
meets dual objectives — safety regulations required by the Mine Safety and Health Administration for ongoing operations and final reclamation requirements. Therefore, these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not
a part of the asset retirement obligation. Historically, the Company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries. Reclaimed quarry sites owned by the Company are available for sale, typically for
commercial development or use as reservoirs.

The Company believes that its operations and facilities, both owned or leased, are in
substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material



adverse effect on the Company’s operations or financial condition. See “Legal Proceedings” under Item 3 of this Form 10-K, “Note N: Commitments and
Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” of the 2015 Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the 2015 Annual Report, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Environmental Regulation and Litigation” included under Item 7 of this Form 10-K and the 2015 Annual Report. However, future events, such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and
regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect
on the Company.

In general, quarry, mining, and cement production facilities must comply with air quality, water quality, and noise
regulations, zoning and special use permitting requirements, applicable mining regulations, and federal health and safety requirements. As new quarry and mining sites are located and acquired, the Company works closely with local authorities during
the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries and mines in such a way as to minimize disturbances. The Company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry, mine, and production facilities can be situated substantial
distances from surrounding property owners. Also, in certain markets the Company’s ability to transport material by rail and ship allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas. The Company has established policies
designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations.

As is the case with other companies in the same
industry, some of the Company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica, a common mineral also known as quartz. Excessive, prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung
diseases, including silicosis, and several scientific organizations and some states, such as California, have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer. The Mine Safety and Health Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust. The Company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures and/or makes available appropriate
respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels. The Company, through safety information sheets and other means, also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions
its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive, prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular.

As is the case with other companies in the cement industry, the Company’s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln
dust (“CKD”). This production by-product consists of fine-grained, solid, highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices. Because much of the CKD is actually unreacted raw materials, it is
generally permissible to recycle the CKD back into the production process, and large amounts often are treated in such manner. CKD that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills. CKD is currently
exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

In 2010, the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”) included the lime industry as a national enforcement priority under the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”). As part of the industry wide effort, the USEPA issued Notices of
Violation/Findings of Violation (“NOVs”) to the Company in 2010 and 2011 regarding the Company’s compliance with the CAA New Source Review (“NSR”) program at the Magnesia Specialties dolomitic lime manufacturing plant in
Woodville, Ohio. The Company has been providing information to the USEPA in response to these NOVs and has had several meetings with the USEPA. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with the NSR program. The Company cannot
at this time reasonably estimate what reasonable likely penalties or upgrades to equipment might ultimately be required.



The Company believes that any costs related to any required upgrades will be spread over time and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or its financial
condition, but can give no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Magnesia Specialties segment of the business.

In October 2014, the Company received a CAA Section 114 request for information regarding the Manistee, Michigan operations from the
USEPA, similar to the one initially received at the Woodville, Ohio plant. The letter seeks information regarding the Company’s compliance with the NSR program at the Magnesia Specialties manufacturing plant in Manistee, Michigan. No notices of
violation have been received by the Company relating to alleged non-compliance at the Manistee plant. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with the NSR program and has submitted information to the USEPA for review and is awaiting a
response or additional questions. The Company cannot at this time reasonably estimate the costs, if any, that may be incurred relating to this matter.

In September 2005, the USEPA designated several entities as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), at the Ward Transformer Superfund site located in Raleigh, North Carolina. In April 2009, two PRPs filed separate actions in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of North Carolina against more than 100 other entities, including the Company, seeking contribution from the defendants for expenses incurred by the plaintiffs related to work performed at a portion of the site. The USEPA has not designated
the Company as a PRP. The ultimate outcome of these matters will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate number of PRPs and defendants who are held liable for the costs and cannot be determined at this time. The Company
believes that any liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

The Company has been reviewing its operations with respect to climate change matters and its sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In December
2009, the USEPA made an endangerment finding under the Clean Air Act that the current and projected concentrations of the six key greenhouse gases (“GHG” or “GHGs”) in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of
current and future generations. The six GHGs are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. As of 2010, facilities that emitted 25,000 metric tons or more per year of GHGs are required to
annually report GHG generation to comply with the USEPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. In May 2010, the USEPA issued a final rule (known as the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule) that would have required the Company to incorporate best
available GHG control technology in any new plant that it might propose to build and in its existing plants if it modified them in a manner that would increase GHG emissions (in the Company’s case, principally carbon dioxide emissions) by more
than 75,000 tons per year. This rule was challenged in court by various public and private parties, and was upheld in part and invalidated in part by the United States Supreme Court in an opinion issued on June 23, 2014. The Court
concluded that the USEPA may in fact require best available control technology for GHG, but only if the plant is otherwise subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration or Title V air permitting under the USEPA’s rules. It is not
known whether the USEPA will revise its rules in response to the Court’s decision and, if so, what the impact will be on the Company’s operations. No technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing GHGs such as carbon
dioxide have been proven successful in large scale applications other than improvements in fuel efficiency, and it is not known what the USEPA will require as best available control technology for plants or conditions it will require for operating
permits in the event of modifications to plants or construction of new plants.

In Congress, both the House and Senate had considered
climate change legislation, including the “cap-and-trade” approach. Cap and trade is an environmental policy tool that delivers results with a mandatory cap



on emissions while providing sources flexibility in how they comply by trading credits with other sources whose emissions are below the cap. Another approach that had been proposed was a tax on
emissions. The Company believes that climate change legislation is not a priority item in Congress in the near future and that the primary method that greenhouse gases will be regulated is through the USEPA using its rule-making authority. Various
states where the Company has operations are also considering climate change initiatives, and the Company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed.

The operations of the Company’s Aggregates business are not major sources of GHG emissions. Most of the GHG emissions from aggregate
operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources such as heavy construction and earth-moving equipment. The manufacturing operations of the Company’s Magnesia Specialties business in Woodville, Ohio releases carbon dioxide, methane and
nitrous oxide during the production of lime. The Magnesia Specialties operation in Manistee, Michigan releases carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides in the manufacture of magnesium oxide and hydroxide products. Both of these operations are
filing annual reports of their GHG emissions in accordance with the USEPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule.

Cement
production worldwide is estimated to comprise approximately 5% to 10% of CO


or GHG emissions, and the USEPA has indicated that CO


emitted from cement production is the second largest source of CO


emissions in the United States. The Company’s subsidiaries, Riverside Cement Company and TXI, file annual reports of the
GHG emissions relating to their cement operations. In addition, as it operated in California, Riverside Cement has been subject to California’s existing GHG emissions trading/credit program. With the sale of its California business, Riverside
will no longer be required to file such reports. The Company believes that Riverside Cement has purchased an adequate number of additional emission credits to remain under the regulated limits for the pre-sale periods, and that program will not have
a material adverse effect on the Company’s or the Cement business’ financial condition or results of operations.

If and when
Congress passes legislation on GHGs, the Woodville and Manistee operations, as well as the Company’s cement operations, will likely be subject to the new program. In addition, the Company believes that the USEPA may impose additional regulatory
restrictions on emissions of GHGs that will impact the Company’s Woodville, Manistee, and cement operations. The Company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to GHG emission limitations at the Woodville, Manistee, or
cement operations would be passed on to customers. The magnesium oxide products produced at the Manistee operation compete against other products that emit a lower level of GHGs in their production. Therefore, the Manistee facility may be required
to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of GHG emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market. The Company is also continuing to review the obligations of our Manistee facility’s global customer base with regards to
climate change treaties and accords. The Company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of compliance will be, but does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of
either the Magnesia Specialties or Cement businesses.

In California, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, or AB32,
required the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to implement rules designed to achieve a statewide reduction in emissions of GHGs in California to 1990 levels by 2020. In response, CARB adopted rules that establish a market-based
cap-and-trade program, which began on January 1, 2013. The rules applied to Riverside Cement’s cement plant in Oro Grande, California. However, as the plant was sold as of September 30, 2015, Riverside has no further reporting or
compliance obligations for the post-closing periods with respect to these rules.

In 2010, the USEPA issued rules that dramatically
reduced the permitted emissions of mercury, total hydrocarbons, particulate matter and hydrochloric acid from cement plants. The compliance date for these new



standards was September 2015, but the USEPA granted a one-year extension to verify monitoring systems are effective for mercury and hydrogen chloride emissions. The Company has conducted tests to
analyze the current level of compliance of its cement plants with the new standards. All plants required the installation of continuous emissions monitoring (“CEMs”). The Company, through its subsidiary TXI, identified, tested and
installed new control and monitoring equipment for these purposes prior to the original September 2015 deadline, and believe that the cement plants meet the other emission requirements in these rules. The Company does not believe that the costs
relating to these controls and equipment will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the Company or the Cement business.

Employees

As of January 31,

Our business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry.

Economic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate. Demand for our products, particularly in the
nonresidential and residential construction markets, could fall if companies and consumers are unable to get credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects. State and federal budget
issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending. The lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects. Several of our top sales states, from time-to-time, stop or slow
bidding projects in their transportation departments.

We sell most of our aggregate products, our primary business, and our cement
products, to the construction industry, so our results depend on the strength of the construction industry. Since our businesses depend on construction spending, which can be cyclical, our profits are sensitive to national, regional, and local
economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products. During the past few years, the overall economy was hurt by mortgage security losses and the tightening credit markets. Construction spending was
affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, and changes in construction spending by federal, state, and local governments. If economic conditions change, a recession in the construction industry may
occur and affect the demand for our products. The recent economic recession was an example, and our business was hurt. Construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts.

While our business operations cover a wide geographic area, our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate
because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price. If economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas, particularly in our top five sales-generating states of our Aggregates business
(based on net sales by state of destination) of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa, and Georgia, our profitability will decrease. We experienced this situation with the recent economic recession.

The historic economic recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregate products in our industry. Recent years, however, have
shown a turnaround in this trend. For the last four years, our aggregates shipments have increased, reflecting a certain degree of volume stability and modest growth. Prior to 2010, use of aggregate products in the United States had declined almost
40% from the highest volume in 2006. During 2015 our heritage aggregates shipments showed 2.1% improvement compared with 2014 levels, after a 7.5% increase the prior year. This improvement was made in 2015 despite the impact of historic levels of
rainfall in many of our major markets. While historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest rate-sensitive than private sector
spending, during 2015 the unprecedented uncertainty on both the timing and amount of future long-term federal infrastructure funding had negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects. This uncertainty was accompanied by a reduction
in some states’ investment in highway maintenance.

After a decade of 36 short-term funding provisions, a five-year, $305 billion
highway bill,

Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act

(“FAST Act”), was signed into law on December 4, 2015. FAST Act funding will primarily be secured through gas tax collections. Market analysis projects aggregate
demand to increase with the availability of federal funding, with demand peaking in 2018, and thereafter declining with anticipated higher interest and inflation rates. Additionally, many states have recently shown a commitment to securing
alternative funding sources, including initiating special-purpose taxes and raising gas taxes. According to

American Road and Transportation Builders Association

(“ARTBA”), fifteen states have raised gas taxes



and 30 legislative measures (which represented 68% of ballot initiatives) for transportation funding were approved by voters in 2015.

Supported by state spending programs, our aggregates shipments to the infrastructure construction market increased 5% in 2015 compared to an
increase of 12% in 2014 compared with 2013. We believe that the demand and need for infrastructure projects will continue to support consistent growth in this market now that long-term federal funding has been resolved. In 2015, 41% of our product
line aggregates shipments were to the infrastructure construction market.

Within the construction industry, we also sell our aggregates
and cement products for use in both nonresidential construction and residential construction. Nonresidential and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles; when the economy is strong, construction levels rise, and when the
economy is weak, construction levels fall.

In 2015, construction growth was driven by private-sector activity. Nonresidential and
residential construction levels are interest rate-sensitive and typically move in direct correlation with economic cycles. The Dodge Momentum Index, a 12-month leading indicator of construction spending for nonresidential building compiled by McGraw
Hill Construction and where the year 2000 serves as an index basis of 100, remained strong and was 125.2 in December 2015. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, the recent increasing trend of the index is an indication that construction
growth will continue into 2016.

Our aggregates volumes to the nonresidential construction market accounted for 32% of our 2015 aggregates
product line shipments and increased 3% compared with 2014. Light nonresidential, which includes the commercial sector, increased 27% and was partially offset by a decline in heavy nonresidential, which includes the industrial and energy sectors.
Nonresidential investment varies significantly by state. Texas continues to lead the nation in nonresidential construction, demonstrating economic diversity and the ability to replace energy-related shipments currently displaced by low oil prices
with other residential projects. Even with its challenging commodity price environment, we expect continued energy-related activity. On a national scale, Florida and South Carolina each rank in the top 10 states and North Carolina and Colorado each
rank in the top 20 states in growth (based on dollars invested) in nonresidential construction. Notably, recovery in the residential market typically leads to nonresidential growth with a 12-to-18-month lag.

Our aggregates shipments to the residential construction market increased 20% in 2015. Housing strength varies considerably in different areas
of the country. We saw significant residential growth in our key geographic markets, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas. The U.S. Census Bureau reported the total value of private residential construction put in place in 2015
increased 13%. Furthermore, housing starts, a key indicator for residential construction activity, continues to show year-over-year improvement. While 2015 represented the second year that starts exceeded one million since 2008, they still remain
below the 50-year historical annual average of 1.5 million units. Importantly, 2015 housing starts exceeded completions, a trend expected to continue in 2016. Geographically, housing strength varies considerably by state, and Texas leads the
nation in residential starts. Notably, Dallas-Fort Worth is the second ranked metro area in the United States for growth in housing permits. Additionally, Florida, South Carolina, Colorado and North Carolina each rank in the top ten states for
residential starts. In 2015, 17% of our aggregates shipments were to the residential construction market.

Our aggregates product line
shipment variances in 2015 for the Mid-America and Southeast Groups reflect the ongoing recovery in these markets, notably Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. While shipments in the West Group were up due to acquired operations, volumes reflect
the significant precipitation in Texas,



Oklahoma and Colorado, which deferred certain shipments to future periods. The West Group volume variance in 2015 was also impacted by the divestiture of the North Troy quarry and two rail yards,
which were sold in the third quarter of 2014.

Shipments of chemical rock (comprised primarily of high-calcium carbonate material used for
agricultural lime and flue gas desulfurization) and ballast product sales (collectively “ChemRock/Rail”) accounted for 10% of our aggregates shipments and increased 10% in 2015.

Shipments of aggregates-related downstream products typically follow construction aggregates trends.

The Cement business was acquired from TXI on July 1, 2014. The net sales of $367.6 million for 2015 reflected the Company’s leading
position in the Texas market.

Our business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal, state and local sources.

Our aggregates and cement products are used in public infrastructure projects, which include the construction, maintenance, and improvement of
highways, streets, roads, bridges, schools, and similar projects. So our business is dependent on the level of federal, state, and local spending on these projects. The year 2015 was another year of unprecedented uncertainty as it related to both
the timing and amount of future long-term federal infrastructure funding, which negatively affected spending on public infrastructure projects. Despite the uncertainty in long-term funding levels, which wasn’t resolved until near the end of the
year, the total value of United States overall public-works spending increased in 2015. However, federal funding remained flat for the year. This increase in overall public works spending in 2015 demonstrates the commitment of states to address the
underlying demand for infrastructure investment. However, infrastructure investment continued to vary by market and was strongest in the southwestern and southeastern United States in 2015. We saw increased infrastructure spending in 2015 in Texas,
North Carolina, Iowa, and Georgia, four of our five largest revenue generating states. We cannot be assured, however, of the existence, amount, and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects.

The federal highway bill provides annual highway funding for public-sector construction projects. The most recent federal highway bill passed
in December 2015, the FAST Act, after a decade of 36 short-term funding provisions, reauthorizes federal highway and transportation funding programs and stabilizes the Highway Trust Fund. The FAST Act also changes TIFIA funding, a federal
alternative funding mechanism for transportation projects. Under the FAST Act TIFIA funding will range from $275 million to $300 million, and will no longer require the 20% matching funds from state departments of transportation.

Federal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent maximum amounts. Each year, an appropriation act is passed establishing
the amount that can actually be used for particular programs. The annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the Highway Trust Fund. Once the annual appropriation is passed, funds are distributed to each state
based on formulas (apportionments) or other procedures (allocations). Apportioned and allocated funds generally must be spent on specific programs as outlined in the federal legislation. The Highway Trust Fund has experienced shortfalls in recent
years, due to high gas prices (until recently), fewer miles driven and improved automobile fuel efficiency. These shortfalls created a significant decline in federal highway funding levels. In response to the projected shortfalls, money has been
transferred from the General Fund into the Highway Trust Fund over the past several years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, current revenues of approximately $34 billion are falling short of the current annual expenditure level of $41
billion. Therefore, timely Congressional action is needed to address the funding mechanism for the Highway Trust Fund. We cannot be assured of the existence, timing or amount of federal highway funding levels in the future. We also cannot be assured
of the impact of the recent



sharp reduction in gasoline prices on the levels of highway user taxes that might be collected in the future and the corresponding levels of funding to the Highway Trust Fund.

At the state level, each state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various taxes, typically
gasoline taxes and vehicle fees, along with voter-approved bond programs. Shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects, even below amounts awarded under legislative bills. Delays in state
infrastructure spending can hurt our business. Many states have experienced state-level funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects. North Carolina was among the states experiencing these pressures,
and this state disproportionately affects our revenues and profits. Most state budgets, including North Carolina, began to improve in 2014 and 2015 as increased tax revenues helped states resolve budget deficits. Prior to the FAST Act, States had
also taken on a larger role in funding sustained infrastructure investment. For example, the Texas voters in 2014 approved use of the state’s oil and gas production tax collections for annual disbursements to the State Highway Fund.
Additionally, in November 2015, voters passed Proposition 7, a constitutional amendment that will provide an additional $2.5 billion of funding for non-toll roads beginning in 2017. We anticipate further growth in state-level funding initiatives,
such as bond issues, toll roads, and special purpose taxes, as states address infrastructure needs, particularly in periods of federal funding uncertainty. Nevertheless, it is a continuing risk to our business that sufficient funding from federal,
state, and local sources will not be available to address infrastructure needs.

With the passage of FAST Act in December 2015, the
infrastructure market should have increased activity in 2016 and beyond, which should help our business. With most states in recovery or expansion, the sustained decline in energy costs may be the catalyst in some markets to boost construction and
help our business. But those markets heavily dependent on the energy sector, namely Oklahoma and West Virginia, may result in recessions in those areas, with the decrease in oil production, which would hurt our business.

Our aggregates business is seasonal and subject to the weather

.

Since the construction business is conducted outdoors, erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions affect
our business. Adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms, cold weather, snow, and heavy or sustained rainfall, reduce construction activity, restrict the demand for our products, and impede our ability to efficiently
transport material. Adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss, needed plant and equipment repairs, time required to remove water from flooded operations, and similar events. Severe
drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production. The construction aggregates business production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occur in the spring, summer and fall.
Because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity, the production and shipment levels for the Company’s Aggregates business, including all of its aggregates-related downstream operations, vary by quarter. The
second and third quarters are generally the most profitable and the first quarter is generally the least profitable. Weather-related hindrances were exacerbated in 2015 by record precipitation in many of our key markets. The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) has tracked precipitation for 121 years. According to NOAA, 2015 represented the wettest year on record for Texas and Oklahoma, while North Carolina, South Carolina, Colorado and Iowa each experienced a
top-ten precipitation year. Our nation as a whole had its third wettest year in NOAA recorded history. These weather events reduced the Company’s overall profitability in 2015, creating a backlog of construction activity expected to be
completed in 2016. The completion of construction activity backlog in 2016 will depend on the capacity of the affected areas to provide enough resources, such as construction crews and equipment, among others.

Our aggregates business depends on the availability of aggregate reserves or deposits and our ability to mine



them economically.

Our challenge is to find aggregate deposits that we can
mine economically, with appropriate permits, near either growing markets or long-haul transportation corridors that economically serve growing markets. As communities have grown, they have taken up attractive quarrying locations and have imposed
restrictions on mining. We try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion, buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves, developing underground mines, and developing a
distribution network that transports aggregates products by various transportation methods, including rail and water, that allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical, but we can give no
assurances that we will be successful.

Our business is a capital-intensive business.

The property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive. Therefore, we require large amounts of cash to operate our
businesses. We believe that our cash on hand, along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources, will be enough to give us the cash we need to support our anticipated operating and capital needs. Our ability to
generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are
unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business, we may be required, among other things, to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.

Our businesses face many competitors.

Our businesses have many competitors, some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do. Some of our competitors also operate on a
worldwide basis. Our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market, the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate, the pricing practices of other competitors, and the entry of new competitors in a market. We also
face competition for some of our products from alternative products. For example, our magnesia specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesia-based products. As other examples, our aggregates
business may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products and our cement business may compete with international competitors who are importing product to the United States with lower production and
regulatory costs.

Our businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates.

As discussed previously, our operations are highly dependent upon the interest rate-sensitive construction and steelmaking industries.
Therefore, business in these industries and for us may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase.

For example, demand in the
residential construction market in which we sell our aggregate products is affected by interest rates. The Federal Reserve kept the federal funds rate near zero percent for the majority of 2015. The recent increase in the rate by 0.25% represented
the first increase since 2008. The residential construction market accounted for 17% of our aggregates product line shipments in 2015.

Aside from these inherent risks from within our operations, our earnings are also affected by changes in short-term interest rates. However,
rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results. In fact, since 2007, our profitability increased when interest rates rose, based on the last twelve months



quarterly historical net income regression versus a 10-year U.S. government bond. In essence, our underlying business generally serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates.

Rising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets, which could affect our business, as described in greater detail
under “

Disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business”

below.

Our future growth may depend in part on acquiring other
businesses in our industry.

We expect to continue to grow, in part, by buying other businesses. We will continue to look for
strategic businesses to acquire, like our acquisition of TXI in 2014. In the past, we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations, expand our operations, and enter new geographic markets. We will continue to make selective
acquisitions, joint ventures, or other business arrangements we believe will help our company. However, the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at a reasonable price and
our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. We cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations.

We may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock. For example, we used our
common stock in our acquisition of TXI. We may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations. If we use our common stock in this way, the ownership interests of our shareholders will be
diluted and the price of our stock could fall. We operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing the long-term shareholder return.

We have acquired many companies since 1995. Some of these acquisitions were more easily integrated into our existing operations and have
performed as well or better than we expected, while others have not. For example, in 2015 we completed the integration of the operations of TXI, as discussed below, which was more successful than anticipated. We have sold some underperforming and
other non-strategic assets, such as underperforming road paving operations in Arkansas and east Texas, which were sold in 2014, and our non-core asphalt operations in San Antonio, Texas, which were sold in 2015.

Our integration of the acquisition of or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as we hope.

We have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations. Our largest business
acquisition has been our business combination with TXI, which closed in July 2014. In 2015 we completed the integration of TXI’s operations into our own operations, which allowed us to achieve the synergies, cost savings, and operating
efficiencies we had forecast from the TXI acquisition. In fact we completed this integration ahead of schedule and achieved even greater synergies and cost saving than the amount we originally forecast from the TXI acquisition. However, in
connection with the integration of any business that we may seek to acquire, it is a risk factor that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the
level of synergies, cost savings, or operating efficiencies we have forecast from the acquisition.

Any other significant business
acquisition or combination we might chose to do, like the acquisition of TXI, would require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations. We believe we
would be successful in this integration process. Nevertheless, we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we might choose to pursue in the future, if the integration
process takes longer



than expected or is more costly than expected. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include:

•

the inability to successfully combine operations in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings and revenue synergies anticipated to result from the proposed acquisition or business combination, which would
result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or business combination not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;

•

lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either the Company or former customers of the acquired or combined company deciding not to do business with the Company;

•

complexities associated with managing the combined operations;

•

integrating personnel;

•

creation of uniform standards, internal controls, procedures, policies and information systems;

•

potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory issues associated with integrating the remaining operations; and

•

performance shortfalls at business units as a result of the diversion of management attention caused by completing the remaining integration of the operations.

Aggregates-related downstream businesses have lower profit margins and can be more volatile.

For 2015, our asphalt, ready mixed concrete, and road paving businesses accounted for 33% of the net sales of our Aggregates business, up from
8% in 2011. These businesses typically provide lower profit margins (excluding freight and delivery revenues) than our aggregates product line due to potentially volatile input costs, highly competitive market dynamics, and lower barriers to entry.
Therefore, as we expand these operations, our overall gross margin is likely to be adversely affected. We saw this impact our gross margin in recent years. Our overall aggregates-related downstream operations gross margin (excluding freight and
delivery revenues) was 8.9% for 2015 and 2014. The overall gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) of our Aggregates business will continue to be reduced by the lower gross margins for our aggregates-related downstream operations.

Short supplies and high costs of fuel, energy, and raw materials affect our businesses.

Our businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel, natural gas, coal, petroleum coke and other energy. The financial results of these
businesses have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy. While we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy, such as fixed-price supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke, significant increases in costs
or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results. Moreover, fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning our businesses more difficult. Because of the fluctuating
trends in diesel fuel prices, we enter into fixed-price fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk. We currently have a fixed-price commitment for approximately 40% of our diesel fuel
requirements at a rate of $2.20 per gallon through December 31, 2016.

To illustrate how diesel fuel price fluctuations, and other
energy costs, have impacted our business, consider the recent years. In 2013 the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 4% lower than we



paid in 2012, but the average cost of natural gas was 18% higher than 2012. Similarly, in 2014 the average price we paid per gallon of diesel fuel was 8% lower compared to 2013, but the average
cost of natural gas increased 24% from 2013. Diesel fuel, which averaged $2.82 per gallon in 2014 and $2.98 per gallon in 2013, represents the single largest component of energy costs for our Aggregates business. Diesel fuel prices declined rapidly
during December 2014, ending the year at a per gallon price that was 26% below the 2014 average. This trend continued in 2015, as the Company’s average price per gallon of diesel fuel in 2015 was $2.05 on 42.5 million gallons compared with
$3.02 on 36.9 million gallons in 2014. Natural gas costs also declined in 2015, down 28% from the 2014 average cost.

The Company has
fixed price agreements for 100% of its 2016 coal needs. The Magnesia Specialties business has fixed price agreements for the supply of a portion of its coal and natural gas needs.

Cement production requires large amounts of energy, including electricity and fossil fuels. Energy costs represented approximately 26% of the
2015 direct production costs of our Cement business. Therefore, the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses. Prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile. Price increases that we are
unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products, or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity, could adversely affect us. Accordingly, volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results
of our Cement business. Profitability of the Cement business is also subject to kiln maintenance, which requires the plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made. In 2014, the Cement business incurred shutdown costs of $13.3
million during the second half of the year. In 2015, the Cement business incurred shutdown costs of $26 million for the full year.

Similarly our aggregates-related downstream operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement, which serve as key raw
materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete, respectively. Some of these raw materials we can produce internally but most are purchased from third parties. These purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply
constraints and significant price fluctuations, which are beyond our control. The financial results of our aggregates-related downstream operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials. We generally see
frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials. For 2014, we saw higher prices for these raw materials than 2013. This trend reversed in 2015, when we saw lower prices for these raw materials than 2014. Liquid asphalt prices may not always
follow other energy products (e.g., oil or diesel fuel) because of complexities in the refining process which converts a barrel of oil into other fuels and petrochemical products.

Cement is a commodity sensitive to supply and price volatility.

Cement is a commodity, and competition is often based mainly on price, which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand. Prices change
a lot in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions and other market conditions, which we cannot control. When cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market, an
oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand. In that case cement prices generally fall. We cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a
material adverse effect on our Cement business.

Unexpected equipment failures, catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production
curtailments or shutdowns.

Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment, such as our kilns and
finishing mills. This equipment, on occasion, may be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or



damage during accidents. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent
weather conditions. We have one to two-week scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities. In 2015, the Cement business incurred shutdown costs of $26 million during the year. In 2015, the
Magnesia Specialties business incurred shutdown costs of $5.1 million during the year. Any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to
lose revenue due to lost production time.

Our Cement and Magnesia Specialties businesses may become capacity constrained.

If our Cement or Magnesia Specialties businesses become capacity constrained, they may be unable to satisfy on a timely basis the demand for
some of their products, and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments. We can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity, increasing the operational availability of
equipment, reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life. Future demand for our products may require us to expand further our manufacturing capacity, particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing
equipment. However, we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time. Capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to
competitors that are not capacity constrained. In addition, we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize.

Our cement business could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the U.S. in violation of U.S. fair trade
laws.

The cement industry has in the past obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other
countries that violated U.S. fair trade laws. Currently, an antidumping order against cement and clinker from Japan will expire in 2016 unless it is extended by the Federal Trade Commission. As has always been the case, cement operators with import
facilities can purchase cement from other countries, such as those in Latin America and Asia, which could compete with domestic producers. In addition, if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign
producers that are not subject to similar regulations, imported cement could achieve a significant cost advantage over domestically produced cement. An influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders, or sales
of imported cement or clinker in violation of U.S. fair trade laws, could adversely affect our cement business.

Road paving construction operations
present additional risks to our business.

Our aggregates-related downstream operations also present challenges in the paving
construction business where many of our contracts have penalties for late completion. In some instances, including many of our fixed price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date. If we subsequently fail to complete
the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. Under these circumstances, the total project cost could exceed our original estimate, and
we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project. In our road paving construction operations we also have fixed price and fixed unit price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control,
which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time or our original bid. These same issues and risks can also impact some of our contacts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations. These risks are somewhat
mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are for short duration projects.



Changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, the environment, and
other areas of the law, and litigation relating to these matters, affect our businesses. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.

Many federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, the environment, health, safety, and other regulatory matters
govern our operations. We take great pride in our operations and try to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite our extensive compliance efforts, risk of liabilities, particularly environmental
liabilities, is inherent in the operation of our businesses, as it is with our competitors. We cannot assume that these liabilities will not negatively affect us in the future.

We are also subject to future events, including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or
evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities, which may result in additional compliance and other costs. We could be forced to invest in preventive or remedial action, like pollution control facilities,
which could be substantial.

Our operations are subject to manufacturing, operating, and handling risks associated with the products we
produce and the products we use in our operations, including the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products, hazardous substances, and wastes. We are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks, explosions, discharges or
releases of hazardous substances, exposure to dust, and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery.

These risks can
subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death, or property damage, and may result in civil or criminal penalties, which could hurt our productivity or profitability. For example, from time to time we
investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations, as well as operations we have acquired from others, and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by
governmental agencies or private parties.

We are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations. While
we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition, we cannot assume that an adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action would not negatively
affect us.

Labor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses.

Labor unions represent 9.8% of the hourly employees of our aggregates business, none of the hourly employees of our cement business, and 100%
of the hourly employees of our Magnesia Specialties business. Our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our magnesia specialties business at the Manistee, Michigan magnesia chemicals plant and the Woodville, Ohio lime plant expire in
August 2019 and May 2018, respectively.

Disputes with our trade unions, or the inability to renew our labor agreements, could lead to
strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses, raise costs, and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations. We believe we have good relations with all of our employees, including our unionized employees.

Delays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations.



Transportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our
customers, whether by truck, rail, or ship. We also rely heavily on third-party truck and rail transportation to ship coal, natural gas, and other fuels to our plants. Any significant delays, disruptions, or the non-availability of our
transportation support system could negatively affect our operations. Transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints, high fuel costs and various hazards, including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and
other work stoppages. In Texas, we compete for third party trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields, which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us. If there are material changes in the availability or
cost of transportation services, we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to ship our products or fuels at a reasonable cost, which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs.

The availability of rail cars can also affect our ability to transport our products. Rail cars can be used to transport many different types
of products across all of our segments. If owners sell or lease rail cars for use in other industries, we may not have enough rail cars to transport our products.

We have long-term agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregate products from our Bahamas and Nova Scotia
operations to various coastal ports. These contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options. Our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could
affect our ability to transport our products.

When we sold our River District operations in 2011 as part of our asset exchange with
Lafarge, we sold most of our barge long-haul distribution network. As a result, we reduced our risks from distributing our products by barges, especially along the Mississippi River. We still distribute some of our product by barge along
rivers in West Virginia. We may continue to experience, to a lesser degree, risks associated with distributing our products by barges, including significant delays, disruptions, or the non-availability of our barge transportation system that
could negatively affect our operations, water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge, and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations.

Our earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies, which involve subjective judgments and
estimates by our management. Our estimates and assumptions could be wrong.

The accounting standards we use in preparing our
financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards. We make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including our goodwill
impairment testing, our expenses and cash requirements for our pension plans, our estimated income taxes, and how we account for our property, plant and equipment, and inventory. These estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently
uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments. If we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates, our financial results could differ.

While we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate, we could be wrong. Accordingly, our financial results could be different,
either higher or lower. We urge you to read about our critical accounting policies in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results.



The accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by
regulatory bodies and are changed from time to time. New or revised accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively. We urge you to read about our accounting policies in Note A of our 2015 financial
statements. Additional accounting standard updates have been issued, effective January 1, 2018, that amend the accounting guidance on revenue recognition and provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improving comparability
of revenue recognition practices, and improving disclosure requirements. We are currently reviewing how these new provisions will affect us. At this time we do not expect the changes to have a material impact on our financial results. New or revised
accounting standards could change our financial results either positively or negatively.

The

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

, and other
related rules and regulations, have increased the scope, complexity, and cost of corporate governance. Reports from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s (“PCAOB”) inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline
findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits. The Company’s costs to respond to these additional requirements and exposure to adverse findings by the PCAOB
of the work performed may increase as to internal controls.

We depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to
attract and retain such personnel could affect our business.

Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued
services of our key personnel and executive officers. Our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for our operations. Competition for personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining
qualified personnel, which could negatively affect our business.

Disruptions in the credit markets could affect our business.

We have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the Company’s business. Demand for aggregates products,
particularly in the infrastructure construction market, has already been negatively affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels, until the recent enactment of a new federal highway
bill. Further, delays or cancellations to capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues
to be eroded by economic uncertainty.

A recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect
on all of our accounts receivable with our customers. We are protected in part, however, by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or end-users. Nevertheless, we experienced a delay in payment from some of our customers during the
construction downturn, which can negatively affect operating cash flows. Historically, our bad debt write-offs have not been significant to our operating results, and, although the amount of our bad debt write-offs has increased, we believe our
allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate.

The credit environment could impact the Company’s ability to borrow money in the
future. Additional financing or refinancing might not be available and, if available, may not be at economically favorable terms. Further, an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings. A reduction in our credit ratings,
regardless of the cause, could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing and/or increase our



cost of obtaining financing. There is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates, which could negatively affect our business.

We may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions, if they arise, or to refinance our outstanding debt.
Any large strategic acquisition would require that we issue both newly issued equity and debt securities, like we did with the acquisition of TXI, in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade
notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction. We are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets, through the interest payable on our outstanding debt and the interest cost on our commercial paper program, to
the extent it is available to us. While management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investment-grade level, we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels. While management believes the Company will continue to
have credit available to it adequate to meet its needs, there can be no assurance of that.

Our Magnesia Specialties business depends in part on the
steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels.

Our Magnesia Specialties business sells some of its products to
companies in the steel industry. While we have reduced this risk over the last few years, this business is still dependent, in part, on the strength of the cyclical steel industry. The Magnesia Specialties business also requires significant amounts
of natural gas, coal, and petroleum coke, and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages.

Our Magnesia
Specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas operations.

Our Magnesia Specialties business sells some of its
products to companies located outside the United States. Approximately 13.3% of the revenues of the Magnesia Specialties business in 2015 were from foreign jurisdictions, principally Canada, Mexico, Europe, South America, and the Pacific Rim, but no
single foreign county accounted for 10% or more of the revenues of the business. Therefore the operations of the Magnesia Specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries
in which it does business in relation to the value of the U.S. Dollar. The business tries to mitigate the short-term effects of currency exchange rates by using the U.S. Dollar as its functional currency in foreign transactions. This still
leaves the business subject to certain risks, depending on the strength of the U.S. Dollar. In 2015, the strength of the U.S. Dollar in foreign markets negatively affected the overall price of the products of the Magnesia Specialties business
when compared to foreign-domiciled competitors.

Our acquisitions could harm our results of operations.

In pursuing our business strategy, we conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and enter into acquisition agreements. Acquisitions involve
significant challenges and risks, including risks that:

•

We may not realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make;

•

We may not be able to retain key personnel of the acquired business;

•

We may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems, and technology;

•

Our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities that are in existence at the time of our acquisition;

•

We may have difficulty entering into new geographic markets in which we are not experienced; or



•

We may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses following the acquisition.

Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and shareholder rights plan and North Carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor.

Our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws, shareholder rights plan, and North Carolina law contain provisions
that may delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our Board of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe
the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions that could
delay, deter, or inhibit a future acquisition include the following:

•

a classified Board of Directors;

•

the ability of the Board of Directors to establish the terms of, and issue, preferred stock without shareholder approval;

•

the requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause;

•

the inability of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and

•

super majority shareholder approval requirements for business combination transactions with certain five percent shareholders.

In addition, we have in place a shareholder rights plan that will trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon acquisitions of our common
stock by a third party above a threshold that are not approved by the Board of Directors. Additionally, the occurrence of certain change of control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments.

Changes in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations.

A number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate, including:

•

Governmental authorities increasing taxes or eliminating deductions, particularly the depletion deduction;

•

The jurisdictions in which earnings are taxed;

•

The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;

•

Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;

•

Changes in available tax credits;



•

Changes in stock-based compensation;

•

Other changes in tax laws, and

•

The interpretation of tax laws and/or administrative practices.

Any significant increase in
our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings for future periods.

We are dependent on information technology and our systems and
infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks.

We are dependent on information
technology systems and infrastructure. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is
also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information, or reputational damage as a result of a cyber-attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at
our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will
prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.

ITEM 2.

PROP

ERTIES

Aggregates Business

As of December 31, 2015, the Company processed or shipped aggregates from 272 quarries, underground mines, and distribution yards in 26
states, Canada, and the Bahamas, of which 109 are located on land owned by the Company free of major encumbrances, 57 are on land owned in part and leased in part, 99 are on leased land, and 7 are on facilities neither owned nor leased, where raw
materials are removed under an agreement. The Company’s aggregates reserves, on the average, exceed 60 years based on normalized levels of production, and exceed 100 years at current production rates. However, certain locations may be subject
to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, the Company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete and/or asphalt products from 131 properties in 5 states, of which 109 are located on land owned
by the Company free of major encumbrances, 1 is on land owned in part and leased in part, 20 are on leased land, and 1 is on a facility neither owned or leased, where product is sold under an agreement.

The Company uses various drilling methods, depending on the type of aggregate, to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable.
The extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site (greensite), an existing location, or a potential acquisition. More extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions, and in rare
cases, the Company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties. Subsequent to drilling, selected core samples are



tested for soundness, abrasion resistance, and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry. If the reserves meet the Company’s standards and are economically mineable, then
they are either leased or purchased.

The Company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling. Proven reserves
are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data, and based on that data the reserves are believed to be relatively homogenous. Proven reserves have a certainty of 85% to 90%. Probable reserves are reserves that are inferred
utilizing fewer drill holes and/or assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties. The degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70% to 75%. In determining the amount of
reserves, the Company’s policy is to not include calculations that exceed certain depths, so for deposits, such as granite, that typically continue to depths well below the ground, there may be additional deposits that are not included in the
reserve calculations. The Company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries, set-backs, and plant configurations, as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves. The Company uses the same methods of analysis to evaluate and
estimate the amount of its aggregates reserves used in the cement manufacturing process for its Cement business as it does for its Aggregates business. For additional information on the Company’s assessment of reserves, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Other Financial Information - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates- Property, Plant and Equipment” under Item 7 of this Form 10-K
and the 2015 Annual Report for discussion of reserves evaluation by the Company.

Set forth in the tables below are the Company’s
estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates of suitable quality for economic extraction, shown on a state-by-state basis, and the Company’s total annual production for the last 3 years, along with the Company’s estimate of years of
production available, shown on a segment-by-segment basis. The number of producing quarries shown on the table includes underground mines. The Company’s reserve estimates for the last 2 years are shown for comparison purposes on a
state-by-state basis. The changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year, whether by acquisition, disposition, or otherwise;
production and sales in the normal course of business; additional reserve estimates or refinements of the Company’s existing reserve estimates; opening of additional reserves at existing locations; the depletion of reserves at existing
locations; and other factors. The Company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a Company-wide, or segment-by-segment basis, and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a state-by-state basis from year to year are
particularly meaningful. The Company’s estimate of reserves shown in the tables below include reserves used in the Company’s Cement and Magnesia Specialties businesses.

Reserves identified with the facilities shown above are contained on approximately 2,844 acres of land owned
by the Company. As of December 31, 2015, the Company estimated its total proven and probable limestone reserves on such land to be approximately 701 million tons.

The Company’s cement manufacturing facilities include kilns, crushers, pre-heaters/calciners, coolers, finish mills and other equipment
used to process limestone and other raw materials into cement, as well as equipment used to extract and transport the limestone from the adjacent quarries. These cement manufacturing facilities are served by rail and truck.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company, through its subsidiaries, also operated 3 cement distribution terminals and owned the real estate
at the California cement grinding and packaging facility it sold on September 30, 2015, which it expects to sell for non-cement use.



Magnesia Specialties Business

The Magnesia Specialties business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in Manistee, Michigan, and Woodville, Ohio. Both of these
facilities are owned.

Other Properties

The Company’s principal corporate office, which it owns, is located in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Company owns and leases various
administrative offices for its five reportable business segments.

Condition and Utilization

The Company’s principal properties, which are of varying ages and are of different construction types, are believed to be generally in
good condition, are generally well maintained, and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used.

During
2015, the principal properties of the Aggregates business were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 65% and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand. However, during the economic recession, the
Company adjusted its production schedules to meet reduced demand for its products. For example, the Company has reduced operating hours at a number of its facilities, closed some of its facilities, and temporarily idled some of its
facilities. In 2015, the Company’s Aggregates business operated at a level significantly below capacity, which restricted the Company’s ability to capitalize $36.7 million of costs that could have been inventoried under normal
operating conditions. If demand does not improve over the near term, such reductions and temporary idling could continue. The Company expects, however, as the economy continues to recover, it will be able to resume production at its
normalized levels and increase production again as demand for its products increases.

During 2015 the Texas cement plants were operating
on average at 70 percent utilization. The Company divested of the California cement plant in 2015. The Portland Cement Association (“PCA”) forecasts a 2.5% increase in demand in Texas in 2016 over 2015. The Cement business’
leadership, in collaboration with the aggregates and ready mixed concrete teams, have developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies, as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency and a road map for significantly
improved profitability for 2016 and beyond. Due to the 24/7/365 nature of cement operations, significant gains in plant utilization and efficiency are typically achieved only during plant shutdowns.

The Company expects future organic growth to result from increased pricing, rationalization of the current product portfolio and/or further
cost reductions. In the current operating environment where steel utilization is at levels close to or below 70% and the strength of the United States dollar pressures product competitiveness in international markets, any unplanned change in costs
or customers introduces volatility to the earnings of the Magnesia Specialties segment.



ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time claims of various types are asserted against the
Company arising out of its operations in the normal course of business, including claims relating to land use and permits, safety, health, and environmental matters (such as noise abatement, blasting, vibrations, air emissions, and water
discharges). Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and it is not possible to determine the probable outcome of, or the amount of liability, if any, from, these matters. In the opinion of management of the Company (which opinion is based in
part upon consideration of the opinion of counsel), based upon currently-available facts, it is remote that the ultimate outcome of any litigation and other proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the overall results of the Company’s
operations, its cash flows, or its financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in any of such litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the Company or its operating segments.

The Company was not required to pay any penalties in 2015 for failure to disclose certain “reportable transactions” under
Section 6707A of the Internal Revenue Code.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of December 31, 2015, an evaluation was performed under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material information required to be disclosed is made known to them in a timely manner as of December 31, 2015 and further concluded that the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles as of December 31, 2015. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.



The foregoing evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on
the definition in Exchange Act Rule 13A-15(e), which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the SEC
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company’s control system will prevent all error and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

The Company’s management has issued its annual statement of financial responsibility and report on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting, which included management’s assessment that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2015. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has
issued an attestation report that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2015. Management’s report on the Company’s internal controls and the attestation report of the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2015 Financial Statements, included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the 2015 Annual Report. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Internal Control and Accounting and Reporting Risk” under Item 7 of this Form 10-K and the 2015 Annual Report.

Included among the Exhibits to this Form 10-K are forms of “Certifications” of the Company’s CEO and CFO as required in
accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Section 302 Certification”). The Section 302 Certifications refer to this evaluation of the Company’s disclosure policies and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting. The information in this section should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.
