PART
                I

Item
                1.
                Business

General

The
      company was
      originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of
      California. In 1986, the company reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in the State
      of
      Delaware. As used herein, the term "Caterpillar," "we," "us," "our," or "the
      company" refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated
      or
      identified otherwise.

Principal
      Lines of Business / Nature of Operations

We
      operate in three
      principal lines of business:

      information, appears in Note 25 on pages A-31 through A-35 of Exhibit
      13.

Other
      information
      about our operations in 2005 and outlook for 2006, including risks associated
      with foreign operations is incorporated by reference from "Management's
      Discussion and Analysis" on pages A-38 through A-63 of Exhibit 13.

Competitive
      Environment

Caterpillar
      products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of
      highly competitive markets. In all markets, we compete on the basis of product
      performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the
      intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry
      or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively
      impact operating profit.

Outside
      of the
      United States, certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to
      operating in their home countries.

Mach

nery

The
      competitive
      environment for Caterpillar's machinery business consists of global competitors,
      regional competitors, and specialized local competitors. Principal global
      competitors include Komatsu, Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo
      Group AB), CNH Global N.V., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Terex
      Corporation, JCB, and Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited. Each has a particular
      product line and/or regional pockets of strength. John Deere Construction and
      Forestry Division (part of Deere & Co.) is a principal competitor only in
      North and South America. Some competitors have broad ranges of products that
      compete with Caterpillar. Others, like Ingersoll-Rand, only offer a limited
      range of products that compete with Caterpillar.

During
      2005,
      increased demand for construction machinery continued, and most of our
      competitors saw continued improvement in sales and operating profit. Supply
      chain and material cost challenges continued for many major competitors.
      Distribution channel challenges experienced by some competitors moderated
      somewhat. Asia-based competitors with significant business in China benefited
      from industry improvements there. Europe-based competitors remain most impacted
      by the value of the euro. Most North America-based competitors continued to
      benefit from strong North American industry demand. The competitive environment
      in the machinery business remains intense, and the financial health of the
      industry as a whole continues to improve.

Caterpillar's
      logistics business provides integrated supply chain services for Caterpillar
      and
      to over fifty other companies worldwide. It competes with global, regional
      and
      local competitors including companies such as DHL and UPS. The unit has grown
      rapidly since its inception in 1987 and the contract logistics industry is
      expected to continue to grow at rates above that of the global economy as a
      whole.

Engines

Caterpillar
      operates in a very competitive engine/ turbine manufacturing and packaging
      environment. In North America, on-highway heavy-duty and mid-range diesel engine
      competitors include but are not limited to Cummins Inc., Volvo Group AB, Mack
      Trucks, Inc. (part of Volvo Group AB), Detroit Diesel Corp. and Mercedes-Benz
      (both part of DaimlerChrysler AG), Isuzu Motors, Ltd. and Navistar International
      Corp. During 2005, these truck engine competitors continued to market heavy-duty
      and mid-range on-highway emissions-certified engines meeting the current United
      States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission requirements. Overseas
      on-highway diesel engine competitors include but are not limited to
      Mercedes-Benz (part of DaimlerChrysler AG), Volvo Group AB, Mitsubishi Fuso
      Truck & Bus Corp. (part of Daimler Chrysler AG), Scania AB, MAN
      Aktiengesellschaft, Iveco Motors, Isuzu Motors, Ltd., Hino Motors, Ltd. and
      MWM
      Motores Diesel. In addition, the industry continued strong investment in new
      technology to meet future on- and off-highway emission regulations in North
      America, Europe, and Asia.

Page

In
      the North
      America off-highway mobile and stationary markets, domestic-based competitors
      include but are not limited to Cummins Inc., John Deere Power Systems (part
      of
      Deere & Co.), Detroit Diesel Corp., Ford Power Products (part of Ford Motor
      Co.), General Electric Co., Kohler Co., Katolight Corp., Generac Power Systems,
      Inc., Multiquip Inc., Stewart & Stevenson Services, Inc., Waukesha (part of
      Dresser Inc.) and other regional companies. Overseas-based off-highway mobile
      and stationary competitors include but are not limited to Wartsila NSD, MAN
      B&W Diesel AG, MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH (part of DaimlerChrysler AG), Volvo
      Penta (part of Volvo Group AB), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., Deutz AG,
      GE
      Jenbacher (part of General Electric Co.), Kubota Corp., Isuzu Motors, Ltd.,
      Yanmar Diesel Engine Co. Ltd., Bergen (part of Rolls Royce plc), Rolls-Royce
      plc, Siemens AG, Alstom, SDMO, Himoinsa s.l., Atlas Copco AB, Kawasaki Heavy
      Industries, Ltd., and AKSA Power Generation (Kazanci Holding). Some of these
      competitors are packagers who source emission-compliant as well as non-compliant
      engines and turbines and other components from domestic and international
      suppliers, and market products regionally and internationally through a variety
      of distribution channels.

During
      2005,
      Caterpillar continued in its leadership position in the North America on-highway
      truck market. Since the introduction of its five engine models with ACERT®
Technology beginning in 2003, the company has shipped over 300,000 ACERT engines
      into the North America on-highway truck market, and continued to maintain its
      leadership position in this market. Customer acceptance of Caterpillar ACERT
      engine performance, quality, and reliability is strong.

Caterpillar
      also
      continued to focus investment and resources on leveraging ACERT Technology
      into
      off-road markets as well as into more of its engine platforms. The building
      blocks for ACERT Technology are very flexible and scaleable and are being
      applied as needed based on engine platform and application. Since October 2004
      through year-end 2005, the company has shipped 45 models of Caterpillar machines
      powered by engines with ACERT Technology with a further 25 models planned for
      introduction in 2006. A line of nine ACERT industrial engines has been released,
      and ACERT Technology will be further leveraged throughout Caterpillar's
      businesses and engine platforms. We expect this to establish Caterpillar as
      the
      first company to offer a full line of Tier 3/Stage IIIA emission compliant
      off-highway engines.

We
      believe ACERT
      provides Caterpillar a competitive advantage now and in the future to meet
      emission and performance requirements, and we plan to continue investing in
      developing and leveraging ACERT Technology systems and components.

Caterpillar’s
      remanufacturing business provides services for a variety of products and
      services to Caterpillar and other external clients. The remanufacturing business
      competes on a regional basis with similarly sized or smaller companies. The
      company launched the remanufacturing business in the 1970s with engines and
      is
      now one of the world’s largest remanufacturers, processing more than two million
      units annually and recycling more than 100 million pounds of remanufactured
      products each year. The business continues to grow at rates well above that
      of
      the global economy as a whole.

Financial
                Products

Cat
      Financial,
      incorporated in Delaware, is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar.
      Cat Financial's primary business is to provide retail-financing alternatives
      for
      Caterpillar products to customers and Caterpillar dealers around the world.
      Such
      retail financing is primarily comprised of financing of Caterpillar equipment,
      machinery and engines. In addition, Cat Financial also provides financing for
      vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases,
      incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial
      provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term
      dealer receivables from Caterpillar. The various financing plans offered by
      Cat
      Financial are designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar
      products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion
      of Cat Financial's activity is conducted in North America. However, Cat
      Financial has additional offices and subsidiaries in Asia, Australia, Europe
      and
      Latin America.

For
      25 years, Cat
      Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it
      participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends,
      product structuring and customer needs.

Page

In
      certain
      instances, Cat Financial's operations are subject to supervision and regulation
      by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be
      subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing
      various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things, (i) regulate
      credit granting activities, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance
      charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers, (iv) govern
      secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other
      trade practices, (vi) prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit and
      administration of loans, and (vii) regulate the use and reporting of information
      related to a borrower's credit experience.

Cat
      Financial's
      retail financing leases and installment sale contracts (total 58 percent*)
      include:

·

Tax
                leases
                that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial
                accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease.
                For
                tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment
                (17
                percent*).

·

Finance
                (non-tax) leases where the lessee is considered the owner of the
                equipment
                during the term of the lease and the agreement either requires or
                allows
                the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end
                of the
                term (15 percent*).

·

Installment
                sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to
                purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure
                payments
                over time (25 percent*).

·

Governmental
                lease-purchase plans in the United States that offer low interest
                rates
                and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1
                percent*).

Retail
      notes
      receivables includes:

·

Loans
                that
                allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment as
                collateral to obtain financing (20
                percent*).

Wholesale
      notes
      receivables, finance leases, and installment sale contracts (total 22 percent*)
      include:

·

Inventory/rental
                programs which provide assistance to dealers by financing their inventory,
                rental fleets and rental facilities (6 percent*).

·

Short-term
                dealer receivables Cat Financial purchases from Caterpillar and
                subsidiaries at a discount (16
                percent*).

*Indicates
      the
      percentage of Cat Financial's total portfolio at December 31, 2005. For more
      information on the above and Cat Financial's concentration of credit risk,
      please refer to Note 21 on page A-28 of Exhibit 13.

The
      retail
      financing business is highly competitive, with financing for users of
      Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally
      commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financial's competitors
      include CIT Group Inc.; CitiCapital, a business unit of Citigroup; General
      Electric Capital Corporation and local banks and finance companies. In addition,
      many of our manufacturing competitors use below-market interest rate programs
      (subsidized by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat
      Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising
      programs around the world to respond to these competing offers.

Cat
      Financial's
      results are largely dependent upon Caterpillar dealers' ability to sell
      equipment and customers' willingness to enter into financing or leasing
      agreements. It is also affected by the availability of funds from its financing
      sources and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest
      rates.

Cat
      Financial has a
      "match funding" policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the
      interest rate profile (fixed rate or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with
      the interest rate profile of its receivable portfolio (loans and leases with
      customers and dealers) within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In
      connection with that policy, Cat Financial issues debt with a similar interest
      rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements
      to
      manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some
      cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds. For more information regarding match
      funding, please see Note 3 on pages A-14 and A-15 of Exhibit 13.

In
      managing foreign
      currency risk for Cat Financial's operations, the objective is to minimize
      earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net
      foreign currency balance sheet positions. This policy allows the use of foreign
      currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency
      mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios. None of these foreign
      currency forward contracts is designated as a hedge.

Cat
      Financial
      provides financing only when acceptable criteria are met. Credit decisions
      are
      based on, among other things, the customer's credit history, financial strength,
      and equipment application. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest
      in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage
      on
      financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar
      dealers' sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment, especially in North
      America. Cat Financial's competitive position is improved by marketing programs,
      subsidized by Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers, which allow it to offer
      below-market interest rates. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer,
      subsidizes an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial
      then
      recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. Transaction processing
      time and the supporting technologies continue to drive Cat Financial in its
      efforts to respond quickly to customers and improve internal processing
      efficiencies. We believe Cat Financial's web-based Cat Financ

      France, Canada and Australia helps to give Cat Financial a competitive advantage
      in those areas. Cat Financ

Cat
      Power Ventures,
      a wholly owned

subsidiary of Caterpillar, primarily
      invests equity and takes an ownership interest in power generation projects
      throughout the world that utilize Caterpillar power generation equipment. In
      some cases, these projects also utilize construction and operations and
      maintenance services that are provided by other Caterpillar subsidiaries. Cat
      Power Ventures has investments in power projects in Poland, the Dominican
      Republic, Tunisia, Cambodia and India and has created direct and indirect
      subsidiaries and affiliates to hold these investments. In December 2005, the
      company decided that it would no longer invest equity in power generation
      projects. As a result, Cat Power Ventures will not make any new equity
      investments in power generation projects and will sell its project investment
      portfolio. We expect these sales to be completed and for Cat Power Ventures
      to
      have ceased operations by the end of 2007.

Business
      Developments in 2005

Our
      focus in 2005
      was on meeting customer delivery expectations while creating stockholder value.
      We effectively responded to unprecedented customer demand and reported full-year
      sales and revenues of $36.339 billion and profit-per-share of $4.04, up 40
      percent over 2004. In September 2005, Caterpillar was selected as a member
      of
      the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the fifth consecutive year. The
      Index recognizes leading sustainability-driven companies worldwide and measures

the
      environmental, economic and social dimensions of their businesses. We strive
      to
      be a global leader in sustainability and we promote sustainable development
      consistent with our business goals, having made sustainable development an
      enterprise-wide focus in our Vision 2020 strategy.

In
      October, we
      introduced our Vision 2020, which set forth new enterprise strategy and goals
      for 2010 and beyond. Through Vision 2020, we established key enterprise goals
      for 2010 grouped under the “3Ps” of people, performance and profitable growth.
      Our people goals include a highly engaged workforce and world-class safety.
      Our
      performance goals are related to improved quality and market leadership in
      every
      major product group we serve. Our profitable growth goals include a 2010 sales
      and revenues target and goals for profitable growth.

We
      also updated our
      Worldwide Code of Conduct (Code) in October, which was first published in 1974.
      Our most recent update to our Code builds upon our strong heritage by explicitly
      describing the values-based culture we are building across our company.

In
      terms of growing
      our company, we expanded our remanufacturing operations in 2005 through a series
      of moves that included the announcement of a new Remanufacturing Division to
      support the remanufacturing services that we have been providing since the
      1970s. We also entered into a series of business transactions aimed at
      developing and achieving our growth goals for our remanufacturing operations
      including the purchase of a minority interest in France-based Eurenov S.A.,
      a
      remanufacturer of automotive and industrial engines, transmissions and
      components in June and the signing of a memorandum of understanding in August
      to
      act as Land Rover’s lead global remanufacturing services provider.

Page

In
      2005, we
      announced a number of other efforts to grow our company including the formation
      of a new Production Systems Division, which will lead an enterprise wide
      transformation of our manufacturing systems to help set a “gold standard” for
      quality, safety and speed in industry and a new Caterpillar Global Pipeline
      group that will have a global focus on the pipeline construction industry.
      We
      also announced the expansion of manufacturing operations for the Electric Power
      Division with a new electric power manufacturing facility in Newberry, South
      Carolina to open in 2006 and a major expansion of our forestry equipment
      manufacturing operations in LaGrange, Georgia.

We
      continued to
      expand upon our growth initiatives in China in 2005. In January we announced
      the
      selection of the city of Qingdao in the Shandong Province as the location for
      a
      state-of-the-art research and development center for product and process
      development in China, continuing to build upon our multi-year strategy for
      expanding our presence in China. The selection of Qingdao for the center is
      expected to provide a focal point for product development and accelerate the
      introduction of company technology into our design and production process in
      China. We also finalized the acquisition of a minority ownership in Shandong
      SEM
      Machinery Co. Ltd., one of China’s leading wheel loader manufacturers in March,
      and in August, we signed three non-binding memoranda of understanding with
      the
      Shanghai Lingang Economic Development Co., Ltd., an industrial park development
      company affiliated with the Shanghai Municipal Government, which allowed us
      to
      demonstrate our continued commitment to customer service and growth in the
      China
      market.

We
      also continued
      to leverage our award-winning ACERT Technology to solidify our position as
      the
      emissions reduction leader in both on- and off-highway applications. ACERT
      Technology enabled us to meet Tier 3 emission requirements ahead of the January
      2005 (300 - 750 HP) and January 2006 (175 - 300 HP) implementation dates. In
      February 2005, the new 1055D paver powered by a C7 ACERT engine rated at 225
      HP
      was shipped nearly a year ahead of the January 2006 implemention date. In March
      2005 at CONEXPO/CON-AGG in Las Vegas, Nevada, the company’s display included 11
      Caterpillar machines powered by engines featuring ACERT Technology. In October
      2005, the company invited the media to a ceremony recognizing the production
      of
      the 10,000

th

ACERT machine
      engine and the 2,500

th

ACERT industrial
      engine. These milestones continue to establish the importance of our ACERT
      Technology, demonstrating the competitive advantage it provides to Caterpillar
      and the value it provides to our customers and the public at large.

Acquisitions

Information
      related
      to acquisitions appears in Note 26 on page A-36 of Exhibit 13.

Order
      Backlog

The
      dollar amount
      of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $12.2 billion at December
      31,
      2005 and $9.1 billion at December 31, 2004. Of the total backlog, approximately
      $1.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2004, was
      not
      expected to be filled in the following year. Our backlog is generally highest
      in
      the first and second quarters because of seasonal buying trends in our
      industry.

Dealers

Our
      machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers
      (dealer network

),


located in the United States and 128 located outside the United States.
      Worldwide, these dealers serve 182 countries and

operate

3,510

places of business, including

1,587

dealer
      rental outlets.

Reciprocating
      engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other
      manufacturers for use in their products. Some of the reciprocating engines
      manufactured by Perkins Engines Company Limited (Perkins) are also sold through
      a worldwide network of 140 distributors located in 170 countries along with
      3,500 supporting dealers. Most of the electric power generation systems
      manufactured by FG Wilson are sold through a worldwide network of 200 dealers
      located in 180 countries.

These
      dealers do
      not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and
      servicing of our products are the dealers' principal business. Turbines and
      large marine reciprocating engines are sold through sales forces employed by
      the
      company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales
      representatives.

Page

The
      company's
      relationship with each independent dealer within the dealer network is
      memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement. Pursuant to this
      agreement, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its
      products and to service the products in a specified geographic region. Prices
      to
      dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on
      transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend
      its
      intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the
      dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to
      the
      company's trademarks, service marks and brand names.

In
      exchange for
      these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the
      sale
      of the company's products to current and prospective customers in the dealer's
      region. Each dealer specifically agrees to employ adequate sales and support
      personnel to market, sell and promote the company's products, demonstrate and
      exhibit the products, perform the company's product improvement programs, inform
      the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of
      any
      of the company's products and maintain detailed books and records of the
      dealer's financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and
      records available at the company's reasonable request.

These
      sales and
      service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written
      notice and terminate automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection
      or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors.

Patents
      and Trademarks

Our
      products are
      sold primarily under the brands "Caterpillar," "Cat," design versions of "Cat"
      and "Caterpillar," "Solar Turbines," "MaK," "Perkins," "FG Wilson" and
      "Olympian." We own a number of patents and trademarks relating to the products
      we manufacture, which have been obtained over a period of years. These patents
      and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue
      to be of value in the future. We do not regard any of our business as being
      dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.

Research
      and Development

We
      have always
      placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating
      to
      the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components.
      In
      2005, 2004, and 2003, we spent $1,084

million,

$928 million, and
      $669 million, or 3.0 percent, 3.1 percent, and 2.9 percent of our sales and
      revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs.

Employment

As
      of December 31,
      2005, we employed 85,116 persons of whom 41,238 were located outside the United
      States. From a global, enterprise perspective, we believe our relationship
      with
      our employees is very good. We build and maintain a productive, motivated
      workforce by treating all employees fairly and equitably.

In
      the United
      States, most of our 43,878 employees are at-will employees and, therefore,
      not
      subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. At select business
      units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment
      contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other
      benefits.

As
      of December 31,
      2005, there were 13,453 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by
      collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The United
      Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)
      represents 11,515 Caterpillar employees under a six-year central labor agreement
      that will expire March 1, 2011. The International Association of Machinists
      (IAM) represents 1,938 employees under labor agreements that expired on April
      30, 2005, and May 29, 2005.

Outside
      the United
      States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those
      countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions
      of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary
      terms
      in the subject jurisdiction.

Sales

Sales
      outside the
      United States were 53 percent of consolidated sales for 2005

,

54 percent

for
      2004, and 56 percent for 2003

.

Environmental
      Matters

We
      strive to be a
      global leader in sustainability and we promote sustainable development
      consistent with our business goals, in line with our Vision 2020 strategy.

The
      company is
      regulated by federal, state, and international environmental laws governing
      our
      use of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our
      manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development
      of
      our products, including through required compliance with air emissions standards
      applicable to internal combustion engines. Compliance with these existing laws
      has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or
      competitive position.

We
      are cleaning up
      contamination at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant
      to
      federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay clean-up costs at a
      site
      and those costs can be estimated, the costs are charged against our earnings.
      In
      formulating that estimate, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered
      from insurance companies or others. The amount recorded for environmental
      clean-up is not material and

is
      included in
      Statement 2 on page A-6 of Exhibit 13 under "Accrued Expenses."

We
      cannot estimate
      costs on sites in the very early stages of clean-up. Currently, we have several
      sites in the very early stages of clean-up, and there is no more than a remote
      chance that a material amount for clean-up at any individual site or at all
      sites in the aggregate will be required.

Available
      Information

The
      company files
      electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required
      reports on Form 8-K, Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 11-K; proxy materials;
      ownership reports for insiders as required by Section 16 of the Securities
      Exchange Act of 1934; and registration statements on Forms S-3 and S-8, as

Item
                  1A. Business Risk
                  Factors

An
      investment in
      our securities involves a number of risk and uncertainties. You should carefully
      consider the following risks, together with the cautionary statement under
      the
      caption “SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF
      1995” in Item 7 of this report and the other information included in this
      report, before purchasing our securities. The risks described below are not
      the
      only ones we face. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that
      we
      currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely
      affect our financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following
      risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operation
      could be adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our securities
      could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Interest
      Rates

The
      U. S. Federal
      Reserve Board has raised interest rates at 14 consecutive meetings and, while
      hinting the tightening cycle is about over, has not clearly specified at what
      rate it plans to stop. Overall economic growth has slowed; however, business
      investment and manufacturing continue to perform strongly. Should the Fed decide
      to continue with several more rate increases, prospects for business investment
      and manufacturing could deteriorate sufficiently to impact sales opportunities.
      In the Eurozone, any additional interest rate increases there could halt an
      economic recovery that just started in the last half of 2005, jeopardizing
      a
      modest improvement in sales.

Production
      Capacity

The
      ongoing
      recovery in the world economy, as well as in Caterpillar sales, has extensively
      used available productive capacity in many industries and stressed the world's
      transportation system. Our forecast for 2006 assumes continued good world
      economic growth, as well as another increase in our sales. As a result, capacity
      in a number of industries could become even tighter and more vulnerable to
      disruptions, such as labor disagreements, weather or lack of raw materials.
      Such
      disruptions could result in material cost spikes, disruptions in production,
      or
      increased inefficiencies, all of which would impair our ability to efficiently
      meet customer demand.

Metal
      and Energy Prices

The
      increase in
      metals and energy prices since 2002 has significantly boosted demand for
      machines and engines. Factors causing higher prices, tight supplies and growing
      demand, are expected to remain in place in 2006. However, metals and energy
      prices are volatile and a sudden drop in demand, perhaps resulting from weaker
      economic growth, could cause a collapse in prices. Such an event would weaken
      economic growth in many developing countries and reduce investments in new
      production capacity for metals and energy.

Item
              2.
              Properties.

General
      Information

Caterpillar's
      operations are highly integrated. Although the majority of our plants are
      involved primarily in the production of either machines or engines, several
      plants are involved in the manufacturing of both. In addition, several plants
      are involved in the manufacturing of components which are used in the assembly
      of both machines and engines. Caterpillar's parts distribution centers are
      involved in the storage and distribution of parts for machines and engines.
      Also, the research and development activities carried on at our Technical Center
      (as described below) involve both machines and engines.

Properties
      we own
      are believed to be generally well maintained and adequate for present use.
      Through planned capital expenditures, we expect these properties to remain
      adequate for future needs. Properties we lease are covered by leases expiring
      over terms of generally one to 10 years. We anticipate no difficulty in
      retaining occupancy of any leased facilities, either by renewing leases prior
      to
      expiration or by replacing them with equivalent leased facilities.

Headquarters

Our
      corporate
      headquarters are in Peoria, Illinois. Additional marketing headquarters are
      located both inside and outside the United States. The Financial Products
      Division is headquartered in leased offices located in Nashville,
      Tennessee.

Distribution

Distribution
      of our
      parts is conducted from parts distribution centers inside and outside the United
      States. Caterpillar Logistics Services, Inc., distributes other companies'
      products utilizing certain of our distribution facilities as well as other
      non-Caterpillar facilities located both inside and outside the United States.
      We
      also own or lease other storage facilities that support distribution activities.

At
      December 31,
      2005, the net book value of properties located outside the United States
      represented about 40.8 percent of the net book value of all properties reflected
      in our consolidated financial position. Additional information about our
      investment in property, plant and equipment appears in Note 1F on page A-10
      and
      Note 10 on page A-19 of Exhibit 13.

Technical
      Center, Training Centers, Demonstration Areas, and Proving
      Grounds

We
      own a Technical
      Center located in Mossville, Illinois, and various other training centers,
      demonstration areas and proving grounds located both inside and outside the
      United States.

Manufacturing,
      Remanufacturing, and Overhaul

Manufacturing,
      remanufacturing and overhaul of our products are conducted at the following
      locations. These facilities are believed to be suitable for their intended
      purposes with adequate capacities for current and projected needs for existing
      products.

Item
                  3. Legal
                  Proceedings.

We
      have disclosed
      certain individual legal proceedings in this filing. Additionally, we are
      involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course
      of
      business. The most prevalent

of
      these unresolved
      actions

involve disputes
      related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including
      claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues
      and
      intellectual property rights. Although it is not possible to predict with
      certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of probable
      loss, we believe that these unresolved legal actions will not individually
      or in
      the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
      position, liquidity or results of operations.

On
      January 16,
      2002, Caterpillar commenced an action in the Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial
      Circuit of Illinois in Peoria, Illinois, against Navistar International
      Transportation Corporation and International Truck and Engine Corporation
      (collectively Navistar). The lawsuit arises out of a long-term purchase contract
      between Caterpillar and Navistar effective May 31, 1988, as amended from time
      to
      time (the Purchase Agreement). The pending complaint alleges, among other
      things, that Navistar breached its contractual obligations by: (i) paying
      Caterpillar $8.08 less per fuel injector than the agreed upon price for new
      unit
      injectors delivered by Caterpillar; (ii) refusing to pay contractually agreed
      upon surcharges owed as a result of Navistar ordering less than planned volumes
      of replacement unit injectors; and (iii) refusing to pay contractually agreed
      upon interest stemming from Navistar's late payments. As of September 30, 2005,
      the net past due receivable from Navistar regarding the foregoing and included
      in “Long-term receivables - trade and other” in the Consolidated Statement of
      Financial Position totaled $139 million. The pending complaint also has claims
      alleging that Newstream Enterprises and Navistar, collectively and individually,
      failed to pay the applicable price to Caterpillar for shipments of unit
      injectors to Newstream. As of September 30, 2005, the net past due receivables
      for the foregoing, included in “Long-term receivables - trade and other” in the
      Consolidated Statement of Financial Position totaled $12 million. The pending
      complaint further alleges that Sturman Industries, Inc. and Sturman Engine
      Systems, Inc. colluded with Navistar to utilize technology that Sturman
      Industries, Inc. misappropriated from Caterpillar to help Navistar develop
      its
      G2 fuel system, and tortiously interfered with the Purchase Agreement and
      Caterpillar's prospective economic relationship with Navistar. The pending
      complaint further alleges that the two parties' collusion led Navistar to select
      Sturman Engine Systems, Inc., and another company, instead of Caterpillar,
      to
      develop and manufacture the G2 fuel system.

On
      September 30,
      2005, International Truck and Engine Corporation (International) commenced
      an
      action against Caterpillar in the Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit
      of
      Illinois in Peoria, Illinois. The lawsuit states that it arises out of the
      May
      31, 1988 Purchase Agreement described above. The Complaint alleges, among other
      things, that Caterpillar procured the May 31, 1988 Purchase Agreement by
      fraudulently misrepresenting or concealing information related to the business
      of selling fuel injectors to International, and that Caterpillar breached the
      Purchase Agreement. International’s Complaint does not specify the amount of
      damages being sought. Caterpillar intends to defend itself vigorously in this
      case.

On
      May 7, 2002,
      International commenced an action against Caterpillar in the Circuit Court
      of
      DuPage County, Illinois regarding a long-term agreement term sheet ("term
      sheet") (the “first lawsuit”). In its sixth amended complaint in the first
      lawsuit, International alleged that the term sheet constitutes a legally binding
      contract for the sale of heavy-duty engines at specified prices through the
      end
      of 2006, alleged that Caterpillar breached the term sheet by, among other
      things, raising certain prices effective October 1, 2002, and also alleged
      that
      Caterpillar breached an obligation to negotiate a comprehensive long-term
      agreement referenced in the term sheet. International sought declaratory and
      injunctive relief as well as damages in an amount to be determined at trial.
      Caterpillar denied International's claims and filed a counterclaim seeking
      a
      declaration that the term sheet had been effectively terminated. Caterpillar
      also asserted that pursuant to a subsequent agreement International released
      Caterpillar from certain of its claims. On September 24, 2003, the Appellate
      Court of Illinois, ruling on an interlocutory appeal, issued an order consistent
      with Caterpillar's position that, even if the court subsequently determines
      that
      the term sheet is a binding contract, it is indefinite in duration and was
      therefore terminable at will by Caterpillar upon reasonable notice. On April
      12,
      2005, International commenced a second, related action against Caterpillar
      in
      the Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois (the “second lawsuit”). The second
      lawsuit contained allegations similar to the allegations contained in the first
      lawsuit. International also alleged in the second lawsuit that Caterpillar
      materially breached the subsequent agreement. On June 15, 2005, International
      voluntarily dismissed its complaint in the first lawsuit. The second lawsuit
      has
      been consolidated with Caterpillar’s counterclaims from the first
      lawsuit.

Trial
      is currently
      scheduled to begin on during the third quarter of 2006. This case is not related
      to the breach of contract action brought by Caterpillar against Navistar which
      is currently pending in the Circuit Court of Peoria County, Illinois.

In
      a letter dated November 15, 2004, the EPA proposed a civil penalty of $641,392
      to Caterpillar for the alleged failure to comply with certain requirements
      of
      the Federal Clean Air Act. The EPA alleges that Caterpillar constructed a
      facility in Emporia, Kansas, and failed to comply with Section 112(g)(2)(B)
      of
      the Clean Air Act. Caterpillar sold the Emporia facility in December 2002.
      We
      are seeking a settlement of this matter with all concerned parties and, in
      the
      opinion of our management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not
      have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity
      or results of operations.

During
      the second
      quarter of 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its field
      examination of our 1995 through 1999 U.S. tax returns. In connection with this
      examination, we received notices of certain adjustments proposed by the IRS,
      primarily related to foreign sales corporation (FSC) commissions, foreign tax
      credit calculations and research and development credits. We disagree with
      these
      proposed adjustments and are vigorously disputing this matter through applicable
      IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate. Although the final resolution
      of
      the proposed adjustments is uncertain, in the opinion of our management, the
      ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect
      on
      our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

      111,000 shares of Caterpillar common stock or foreign denominated equivalents
      were distributed under the plans. Participants in some foreign plans have the
      option of receiving non-U.S. share certificates (foreign-denominated
      equivalents) in lieu of U.S. shares of Caterpillar common stock upon withdrawal
      from the plan. These equivalent certificates are tradable only on the local
      stock market and are included in our determination of shares
      outstanding.

SAFE
      HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain
      statements
      contained in our Management's Discussion and Analysis are forward-looking and
      involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. The words
      "believes," "expects," "estimates," "anticipates," "will be", "should" and
      similar words or expressions identify forward-looking statements made on behalf
      of Caterpillar. Uncertainties include factors that affect international
      businesses, as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it
      serves.

World
      Economic Factors

Our
      projection for
      about 3.5 percent growth in the world economy in 2006 assumes central banks
      will
      cautiously raise interest rates so as not to slow growth too much. Low interest
      rates, and continued good economic growth, should encourage further growth
      in
      construction and mining. Should central banks raise interest rates aggressively,
      both world economic growth and our Machinery and Engines sales likely would
      be
      weaker.

We
      expect the U. S.
      Federal Reserve will soon end its policy of raising interest rates and that
      the
      Federal Funds rate will end the year below five percent. Somewhat higher
      interest rates should cause a further slowing in economic growth to slightly
      over three percent in 2006. Other financial factors - long-term interest rates,
      corporate bond spreads - are expected to remain sufficiently favorable to
      support further growth in business investment. Should financial conditions
      tighten noticeably, causing economic growth to slow below three percent,
      expected improvements in Machinery and Engines sales likely would be lower
      than
      projected.

Our
      projection of
      increased sales of Machinery and Engines in Europe, Africa, Middle East (EAME)
      in 2006 assumes that continued low interest rates will allow slightly faster
      economic growth in Europe and that favorable commodity prices will extend
      healthy recoveries in both Africa and Middle East (AME) and the Commonwealth
      of
      Independent States (CIS). Key risks are significant interest rate increases
      in
      the Eurozone that would slow the European economy or a worldwide collapse in
      commodity prices. Those developments would likely negatively impact our
      results.

Page

Somewhat
      higher
      local interest rates in Latin America in 2006 and slower economic growth in
      the
      United States are expected to contribute to a further slowing in Latin American
      economic growth to slightly less than four percent. That rate of growth should
      support further increases in construction spending, and high metals prices
      should benefit investment in mining, both contributing to an increase in
      Machinery and Engines sales. This forecast is vulnerable to a significant
      weakening in commodity prices, widespread increases in interest rates or
      political disruptions.

In
      Asia/Pacific, we
      project economic growth will remain slightly below 6.5 percent in 2006, with
      faster growth in Australia and developing Asia offsetting a slight slowing
      in
      China. The projected increase in Machinery and Engines sales assumes that coal
      and metals prices will contribute to increased mine investment, growing
      populations and rising home prices will benefit housing construction, and rapid
      economic growth will prompt businesses to invest more in structures. Some
      developments that could lower expected results include reduced demand for
      thermal and coking coal, significant revaluations of regional currencies,
      restrictions on regional exports and sharp interest rate hikes, particularly
      in
      China and Indonesia.

Commodity
      Prices

Commodities
      represent a significant sales opportunity, with prices and production as key
      drivers. Prices have improved sharply over the past three years and our outlook
      assumes that continued growth in world industrial production, low inventories
      and some difficulties in increasing production will cause metals prices to
      remain high enough in 2006 to encourage further mine investment. Any unexpected
      weakening in world industrial production, however, could cause prices to drop
      sharply to the detriment of our results.

Coal
      prices showed
      softness in some regions late in 2005 but remained well above prices that make
      mine investment attractive. We expect that the need to rebuild some coal stocks
      as well as increased electricity generation will support demand for coal in
      and prices will remain favorable. Should coal prices soften, due to a slowing
      in
      world economic growth or otherwise, the ongoing sales recovery would be
      vulnerable.

Oil
      and natural gas
      prices increased sharply over the past three years due to strong demand and
      high
      capacity usage. Higher energy prices have not halted economic recoveries since
      strong demand boosted prices and world production increased. High prices are
      encouraging more exploration and development. However, should significant supply
      cuts occur, such as from OPEC production cuts or political unrest in a major
      producing country, the resulting oil shortages and price spikes could slow
      economies, potentially with a depressing impact on our sales.

Monetary
      and Fiscal Policies

For
      most companies
      operating in a global economy, monetary and fiscal policies implemented in
      the
      United States and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth,
      and
      accordingly, demand for our product. In general, higher than expected interest
      rates, reductions in government spending, higher taxes, excessive currency
      movements and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead
      to
      slower economic growth and lower industry demand.

With
      economic data
      looking more favorable, central banks in several developed countries have raised
      interest rates from the lowest rates in decades, with the U. S. Federal Reserve
      Bank being the most aggressive. Our outlook assumes that central banks will
      try
      to avoid increasing rates so much that economic recoveries stall. Should central
      banks raise interest rates more aggressively than anticipated, both economic
      growth and our sales could suffer.

Budget
      deficits in
      many countries remain higher than governments would like. Our outlook assumes
      that governments will not aggressively raise taxes and slash spending to deal
      with their budget imbalances. Such actions could disrupt growth and negatively
      affect our sales.

Political
        Factors

Political
      factors
      in the United States and abroad can impact global companies. Our outlook assumes
      that no major disruptive changes in economic policies occur in either the United
      States or other major economies. Significant changes in either taxing or
      spending policies could reduce activities in sectors important to our
      businesses, thereby reducing sales.

Page

Our
      outlook assumes
      that there will be no additional significant military conflicts in either North
      Korea or the Middle East in the forecast period. Such military conflicts could
      severely disrupt sales into countries affected, as well as nearby
      countries.

Our
      outlook also
      assumes that there will be no major terrorist attacks. If there is a major
      terrorist attack, confidence could be undermined, potentially causing a sharp
      drop in economic activities and our sales. Attacks in major developed economies
      would be the most disruptive.

Our
      outlook assumes
      that efforts by countries to increase their exports will not result in
      retaliatory countermeasures by other countries to block such exports,
      particularly in the Asia/Pacific region. Our outlook includes a negative impact
      from the phase-out of the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion as enacted by the
      American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Our outlook assumes any other tax law
      changes will not negatively impact our provision for income taxes.

Currency
      Fluctuations

The
      company has
      costs and revenues in many currencies and is therefore exposed to risks arising
      from currency fluctuations. Our outlook assumes no significant currency crises
      occur that could disrupt international trade or the competitiveness of our
      facilities. Should any crisis develop, economic activity and our results could
      be negatively impacted.

The
      company's
      largest manufacturing presence is in the United States, so any unexpected
      strengthening of the dollar tends to raise the foreign currency costs to our
      end
      users and reduce our global competitiveness.

Dealer/Original
      Equipment Manufacturers Inventory Practices

The
      company sells
      finished products through an independent dealer network or directly to Original
      Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). Both carry inventories of finished products
      as
      part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their
      assessments of future needs. Such adjustments can impact our results either
      positively or negatively. The current outlook assumes no major changes in either
      dealer or OEM inventory practices. Should dealers or OEMs decide to control
      inventories more tightly, our sales would be lower.

Financial
      Products Division Factors

Inherent
      in the
      operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers.
      The
      creditworthiness of each customer, and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions
      and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors,
      including, but not limited to, relevant industry and economic conditions, the
      availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's
      management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value
      of
      the underlying collateral. Additionally, interest rate movements create a degree
      of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments
      and
      the value of our fixed rate debt. Our "match funding" policy addresses interest
      rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of
      our
      debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio
      (loans and leases with customers and dealers) within pre-determined ranges
      on an
      ongoing basis. To achieve our match funding objectives, we issue debt with
      a
      similar interest rate profile to our receivables and also use interest rate
      swap
      agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes
      and in some cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds. If interest rates move
      upward more sharply than anticipated, our financial results could be negatively
      impacted. With respect to our insurance and investment management operations,
      changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value
      of
      our investment portfolio, thus requiring a negative adjustment to
      earnings.

Other
      Factors

The
      rates of
      infrastructure spending, housing starts, commercial construction and mining
      play
      a significant role in the company's results. Our products are an integral
      component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease
      in
      the United States or abroad, demand for our products may be significantly
      impacted.

Projected
      cost
      savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively
      impacted by a variety of factors. These factors could include, among other
      things, higher than expected wages, energy and/or material costs, and/or higher
      than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade,
      environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any of the
      jurisdictions in which the alliances conduct their operations.

Page

Results
      may be
      impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix. Our outlook
      assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales.
      If
      actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales,
      our
      results could be negatively impacted.

The
      company
      operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a
      forecast of the company's share of industry sales. An unexpected reduction
      in
      that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by
      competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, a failure
      to
      price the product competitively or an unexpected buildup in competitors' new
      machine or dealer owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward pressure
      on
      machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.

The
      environment
      remains competitive from a pricing standpoint. Our 2006 sales outlook assumes
      that the company is successful in implementing worldwide machine price increases
      communicated to dealers with an effective date of January 2006. While we expect
      that the environment will absorb these price actions, delays in the marketplace
      acceptance would negatively impact our results. Moreover, additional price
      discounting to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than
      anticipated realization.

Our
      sales and
      results are generally sensitive to changes in economic growth, particularly
      those originating in construction, mining and energy. Developments reducing
      such
      activities also tend to lower our sales. In addition to the factors mentioned
      above, our sales and results could be negatively impacted by any of the
      following:

·

Any
      sudden drop in
      consumer or business confidence;

·

Delays
      in
      legislation needed to fund public construction;

·

Regulatory
      or
      legislative changes that slow activity in key industries; and/or

·

Unexpected
      collapses in stock markets.

This
      discussion of
      uncertainties is by no means exhaustive, but is designed to highlight important
      factors that may impact our outlook. Obvious factors such as general economic
      conditions throughout the world do not warrant further discussion, but are
      noted
      to further emphasize the myriad of contingencies that may cause the company's
      actual results to differ from those currently anticipated.

Under
      the
      supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
      executive officer and our chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation
      of
      our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange
      Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and
      our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
      procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual
      report.

The
      management of
      Caterpillar Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
      internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial
      reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
      reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial
      statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes
      those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
      that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
      and
      dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
      that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
      statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
      that
      receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
      with
      authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
      reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
      acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
      material effect on the financial statements.

Because
      of its
      inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
      or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
      to
      future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
      because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
      policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness
      of
      the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
      2005.
      In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee
      of
      Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
      Control — Integrated Framework

.
      Based on our
      assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, the company's internal
      control over financial reporting was effective based on those
      criteria.

Our
      management's
      assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial
      reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
      LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. The report appears on
      page A-4 of Exhibit 13.

During
      the last
      fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the company's internal
      controls over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
      likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial
      reporting.
