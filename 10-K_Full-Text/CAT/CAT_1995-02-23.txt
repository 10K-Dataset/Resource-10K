PART I
 
Item 1.  Business.

Principal Business Segments
- ---------------------------
        Caterpillar Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the
"Company") operates in three principal business segments:

        (1)     Machinery--Design, manufacture, and marketing of construction,
                mining, and agricultural machinery--track and wheel tractors,
                track and wheel loaders, pipelayers, motor graders, wheel
                tractor-scrapers, track and wheel excavators, backhoe loaders,
                log skidders, log loaders, off-highway trucks, articulated
                trucks, paving products, and related parts.

        (2)     Engines--Design, manufacture, and marketing of engines for
                earthmoving and construction machines, on-highway trucks, and
                locomotives; marine, petroleum, agricultural, industrial, and
                other applications; electric power generation systems; and
                related parts. Caterpillar diesel and spark-ignited engines meet
                power needs ranging from 54 to 8,000 horsepower. Turbines range
                from 1,340 to 15,000 horsepower (1000 to 11 200 kilowatts).

        (3)     Financial Products--Provides financing alternatives for
                Caterpillar and noncompetitive related equipment, and extends
                loans to Caterpillar customers and dealers. Also provides
                various forms of insurance for Caterpillar dealers and customers
                to help support their purchase and financing of Caterpillar
                equipment.

        Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages A-24
and A-25 of the Appendix to the Company's 1995 Annual Meeting Proxy
Statement contains additional information regarding the Company's business
segments and geographic segments and is incorporated herein by reference.

Company Operations
- ------------------
        The Company conducts operations in the Machinery and Engines segments of
its business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price
competition.  It places great emphasis upon the high quality and performance of
its products and the service support for such products which is supplied by its
dealers.  Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same
types of machines and engines produced by the Company, there are numerous
companies, large and small, which compete with the Company in the sale of each
of its products.

        Machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of
independent full-line dealers, and one company-owned dealership, 65 located in
the United States and 122 located outside the United States.  Worldwide, these
dealers have more than 1,250 places of business.  Diesel and spark-ignited
engines are sold through the worldwide dealer organization and to other
manufacturers for use in products manufactured by them.  Caterpillar dealers do
not deal exclusively in the Company's products, although in most cases sales
and servicing of the Company's products are the dealers' principal business. 
Turbines are sold through a sales force employed by Solar Turbines
Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary, or its subsidiaries and associated
companies.  These employees are from time to time assisted by independent sales
representatives.

        Financial Products consists primarily of Caterpillar Financial Services
Corporation and its subsidiaries, and Caterpillar Insurance Services
Corporation.



 
        Further information concerning the Company's operations in 1994 and its
outlook for 1995 appears under the caption "Management's Discussion and
Analysis" on pages A-28 through A-37 of the Appendix to the Company's 1995
Annual Meeting Proxy Statement, which pages are incorporated herein by
reference.

Patents and Trademarks
- ----------------------
        The Company's products are sold primarily under the marks "Caterpillar,"
"Cat," "Solar," and "Barber-Greene."  The Company owns a number of patents and
trademarks relating to the products manufactured by it, which have been
obtained over a period of years.  These patents and trademarks have been of
value in the growth of the Company's business and may continue to be of value
in the future.  The Company does not regard any segment of the Company's
business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.

Research and Development
- ------------------------
        The Company has always placed strong emphasis on product-oriented
research and engineering relating to the development of new or improved
machines, engines and major components.  In 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Company
expended $435 million, $455 million and $446 million, respectively, on its
research and engineering program.  Of these amounts, $311 million in 1994, $319
million in 1993 and $310 million in 1992 were attributable to new prime products
and major component development and major improvements to existing products.  
The remainders were attributable to engineering costs incurred during the early
production phase as well as ongoing efforts to improve existing products.  
During 1994 the Company announced several new products as well as improvements
to existing products.  The Company expects to continue the development of new
products and improvements to existing products in the future.

Employment
- ----------
        At December 31, 1994, the Company employed 53,986 persons of whom 14,237
were located outside the United States.

Sales
- -----
        Sales outside the United States were 49% of consolidated sales in 1994,
compared with 49% in 1993 and 55% in 1992.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

        CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND EXPENSES

        The Company is subject to extensive environmental regulation at the
federal, state, and local level.  Research, engineering, depreciation, and
administrative expenses related to environmental regulation compliance totaled
approximately $125 million in 1994 and are expected to increase moderately in
1995.  Capital expenditures for pollution abatement and control were
approximately $11 million in 1994 and are expected to increase moderately in
1995.  These expenses and expenditures are expected to remain relatively
constant through 1999 and are not expected to have a material impact upon
Company capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, subject to the
evolving nature and interpretation of the environmental laws by applicable
authorities and future technology.    

        With respect to compliance with the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act
in particular, research, engineering, and operating expenses totaled $29 million
and capital expenditures totaled $4 million in 1994.  In 1995, expenses and
capital expenditures associated with Clean Air Act compliance are expected to
remain constant.


 
        The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act are scheduled to be implemented
throughout the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st Century.  Many
regulations necessary for implementation have not been promulgated. 
Accordingly, the overall impact of the amendments on Company capital
expenditures and product design is still uncertain.

        REMEDIATION COSTS

        As of December 31, 1994, the Company, in conjunction with numerous other
parties, has been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") and is
actively participating in 17 sites identified by the EPA or similar state
authorities for remediation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA") or comparable federal or
state statutes ("CERCLA sites").  The Company is also involved in remediation
activities at other sites located on property either currently or formerly
owned by the Company.  Lawsuits and claims involving additional environmental
matters are likely to arise from time to time.  

        In assessing potential environmental liability, the Company considers:

        .    whether it has been designated as a PRP under CERCLA;

        .    if the Company has been so designated, the number of other PRPs
             designated at a site;

        .    the relative volume contribution alleged for the Company at a
             particular site;

        .    documentation, if any, linking the Company to a particular site;

        .    stage of the proceedings;

        .    available technology;

        .    studies conducted by independent environmental consultants;

        .    prior experience regarding environmental remediation; and

        .    experience of other companies and industries regarding
             environmental remediation.

        With respect to potential liability amounts that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the Company has accrued and charged to income those
amounts.  For specific sites where only a range of liability is probable and
reasonably estimable and no amount in the range is a better estimate than
another, the Company has accrued, in accordance with appropriate accounting
literature, the low end of that range.  While the Company may have rights of
contribution or reimbursement under insurance policies, amounts that may be
recoverable from other entities by the Company with respect to a particular
site are not considered in establishing the accrual.  The amounts accrued in
1994 with respect to potential liability are recorded as part of "Accounts
payable and accrued expenses" on the Company's Statement of Financial Position
appearing on pages A-6 and A-7 of the Appendix to the 1995 Annual Meeting Proxy
Statement.  This amount represents less than one percent of that line item and
accordingly is not material to the Company's financial position.  

        The Company also assesses reasonably possible environmental liability
beyond that which it has accrued.  This liability is not probable, but is more
likely than remote.  As of December 31, 1994, the amount of Company
environmental liability that is reasonably possible is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company's liquidity, capital resources or results of
operations.  Factors considered in assessing reasonably possible liability and
its potential impact on the Company are those stated above. Amounts that may be
recoverable from other entities are not considered.  As of December 31, 1994,
potential liability at four sites cannot be assessed because they are in very
early stages of investigation.


 
Item 1a.  Executive Officers of the Registrant as of December 31, 1994.

 

 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

        The Company's operations are highly integrated. Although the majority of
the Company's plants are involved primarily in the production of either
machines or engines, several of the Company's plants are involved in the
manufacture of both machines and engines.  In addition, several plants are
involved in the manufacture of components which are used in the assembly of
both machines and engines.  The Company's distribution centers and regional
distribution centers are involved in the storage and distribution of parts for
machines and engines.  Also, the research and development activities carried on
at the Technical Center involve both machines and engines.

        The corporate headquarters for the Company are located in Peoria,
Illinois. Additional marketing headquarters are located both inside and outside
the United States.

        All square footage and acreage provided herein is approximated as of
December 31, 1994.

Total Properties
- ----------------
        Total properties owned or leased by the Company consist of 67,257,861
square feet of building area, of which 89.8% is owned in fee and 10.2% is
leased.

Owned Properties
- ----------------
        Properties owned in fee by the Company consist of 60,395,936 square feet
of building area and 19,123 acres of land.  Properties owned by the Company are
believed to be generally well maintained and adequate for the purposes for which
they are presently used.  Through planned capital expenditures, the Company
expects these properties to remain adequate for future needs.

Consolidations / Closures / Sales
- ---------------------------------
        Over the last five years, in the ordinary course of business, the
Company has consolidated operations and / or closed a number of its facilities.
The Company continues to own closed properties totaling 2,676,643 square feet of
building area and 6,611 acres of land which are no longer utilized in current
operations.  These closed properties have been declared surplus and are for
sale.

        In December, 1991, the Company announced the probable closure of its
manufacturing facility in York, Pennsylvania.  The timing of the closure of the
York facility is still pending.  In December, 1994, the Company's manufacturing
facility in Vernon, France was sold.  The previously closed distribution
facility located in New Orleans was also sold in 1994.

Leased Properties
- -----------------
        Properties leased by the Company consist of 6,861,925 square feet of
building area.  These properties are covered by leases expiring over terms of
generally 1 to 10 years.  The Company anticipates no difficulty in retaining
occupancy of any of its leased facilities, either by renewing leases prior to
expiration or by replacing them with equivalent leased facilities.

Manufacturing
- -------------
        Manufacturing activities are conducted at 26 locations inside the United
States and 12 locations outside the United States.  Remanufacturing and
Overhaul activities are conducted at 3 locations inside the United States and 3
locations outside the United States.  These facilities have a total building
area of 43,294,650 square feet, of which 98.6% is  used for manufacturing and
1.4% is used for remanufacturing and overhaul.  These facilities are believed
to be suitable for their intended purposes with adequate capacities for current
and projected needs for existing Company products.  A list of the Company's
manufacturing, remanufacturing and overhaul facilities follows with principal
use indicated:

land, buildings, machinery and equipment appears under Notes 1D and 11 of the
"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages A-10 and A-16 and A-17
respectively, of the Appendix to the 1995 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement, which
Notes are incorporated herein by reference.


ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

        The Company is a party to litigation matters and claims which are normal
in the course of its operations, and, while the results of such litigation and
claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, based on the
advice of counsel, the final outcome of such matters will not have a materially
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position.



 
        On September 6, 1994, the International Union, United Automobile,
Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America ("UAW"), UAW Local 974,
and Citizens for a Better Environment filed a complaint against the Company
with the Illinois Pollution Control Board ("Board").  The complaint generally
alleges, in seven counts, that the Company has violated certain provisions of
the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and Board regulations with respect to
a particular property in East Peoria, Illinois.  The complaint further alleges
that the maximum penalties for the alleged violations total $199 million.  The
Company believes the claims are without merit and will vigorously contest them.
The Company further believes final resolution of this matter will not have a
material impact on the Company's liquidity, capital resources, or results of
operations.

        On May 12, 1993, a Statement of Objections ("Statement") was filed by
the Commission of European Communities against Caterpillar Inc. and certain
overseas subsidiaries ("Company").  The Statement alleges that certain service
fees payable by dealers, certain dealer recordkeeping obligations, a restriction
which prohibits a European Community ("EC") dealer from appointing subdealers,
and certain export pricing practices and parts policies violate EC competition
law under Article 85 of the European Economic Community Treaty.  The Statement
seeks injunctive relief and unspecified fines. Based on an opinion of counsel,
the Company believes it has strong defenses to each allegation set forth in the
Statement.

        On November 19, 1993, the Commission of European Communities informed
the Company that a new complaint has been received by it alleging that certain
export parts policies violate Article 85 and Article 86 of the European Economic
