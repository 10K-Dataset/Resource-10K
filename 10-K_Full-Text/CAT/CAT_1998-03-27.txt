PART I

Item 1.  Business.


Principal Business Segments
- ---------------------------
Caterpillar operates in three principal business segments:

  1.  Machinery--design, manufacture, and marketing of construction, mining, and
      agricultural machinery--track and wheel tractors, track and wheel loaders,
      pipelayers, motor graders, wheel tractor-scrapers, track and wheel
      excavators, backhoe loaders, mining shovels, log skidders, log loaders,
      off-highway trucks, articulated trucks, paving products, telescopic
      handlers, and related parts.

  2.  Engines--design, manufacture, and marketing of engines for earthmoving and
      construction machines, on-highway trucks, and locomotives; marine,
      petroleum, agricultural, industrial, and other applications; electric
      power generation systems; and related parts. Reciprocating engines meet
      power needs ranging from 40 to 13,600 horsepower (30 to 10 150
      kilowatts). Turbines range from 1,340 to 18,000 horsepower (1000 to 13 500
      kilowatts).

  3.  Financial Products--provides financing alternatives for Caterpillar and
      noncompetitive related equipment, and extends loans to our customers and
      dealers. Also provides various forms of insurance to our dealers and
      customers to help support their purchase and financing of our equipment.
      This segment consists primarily of Caterpillar Financial Services
      Corporation and its subsidiaries, and Caterpillar Insurance Services
      Corporation.

Additional information about our business and geographic segments is
incorporated by reference from Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages A-17 through A-18 of the Appendix.


Nature of Operations
- --------------------
We conduct operations in our Machinery and Engines' segments under highly
competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great
emphasis upon the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers'
service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the
same types of machines and engines, there are numerous companies, large and
small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.

Machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of
dealers, 65 located in the United States and 132 located outside the United
States. Worldwide, these dealers have more than 1,400 places of business.
Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the worldwide dealer
organization and to other manufacturers for use in products manufactured by
them. Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most
cases sales and servicing of our products are our dealers' principal business.
Turbines and large marine reciprocating engines are sold through sales forces
employed by Solar Turbines Incorporated and associated companies and MaK Motoren
GmbH & Co. KG, respectively. Occasionally, these employees are assisted by
independent sales representatives.

                                                                          Page 3

 
The Financial Products' segment also conducts business under highly competitive
conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar products is available through a
variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and
leasing companies. We emphasize prompt and responsive service to meet customer
requirements and offer various financing plans designed to increase the
opportunity for sales of our products and generate financing income for our
company.

On December 11, 1997, we announced an agreement with LucasVarity plc to acquire
the assets of Perkins Engines, LucasVarity's diesel engine subsidiary. Perkins
is a leading manufacturer of small to medium diesel engines, and its 1996 sales
were approximately $1.1 billion. The addition of Perkins to our existing engine
business will create a global full-line producer of reciprocating and turbine
engines. A purchase price of $1.325 billion was agreed upon subject to closing
date adjustments. We will pay for this acquisition using a combination of
existing cash and new debt. The acquisition will be accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting.

Additional information about our operations in 1997 and outlook for 1998 are
incorporated by reference from "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on pages
A-20 through A-28 of the Appendix and are discussed under Item 7 to this Form 
10-K.


Patents and Trademarks
- ----------------------
Our products are sold primarily under the marks "Caterpillar," "Cat," "Solar,"
"Barber-Greene," and "MaK". We own a number of patents and trademarks relating
to the products we manufacture, which have been obtained over a period of years.
These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business
and may continue to be of value in the future. We do not regard any segment of
our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.


Research and Development
- ------------------------
We have always placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research and
engineering relating to the development of new or improved machines, engines and
major components. In 1997, 1996, and 1995, we spent $700 million, $570 million,
and $532 million, respectively, on our research and engineering programs. Of
these amounts, $528 million in 1997, $410 million in 1996, and $375 million in
1995 were attributable to new prime products and major component development and
major improvements to existing products. The remainders were attributable to
engineering costs incurred during the early production phase as well as ongoing
efforts to improve existing products. During 1997 we announced several new
products as well as improvements to existing products, including our anticipated
entry into the compact construction machine market in 1998. We expect to
continue the development of new products and improvements to existing products
in the future, with a focus in the areas of power generation equipment, smaller
machines, and agricultural products.


Employment
- ----------
At December 31, 1997, we employed 59,863 persons of whom 20,141 were located
outside the United States.


Sales
- -----
Sales outside the United States were 51% of consolidated sales for 1997 and
1996, and 52% for 1995.

                                                                          Page 4

 
Environmental Matters
- ---------------------
The company is regulated by federal, state, and international environmental laws
governing our use of substances and control of emissions. Compliance with these
existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures,
earnings, or competitive position.

We are cleaning up hazardous waste at a number of locations, often with other
companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is likely we will pay
clean-up costs at a site and those costs can be estimated, the costs are charged
against our earnings. In doing that estimate, we do not consider amounts
expected to be recovered from insurance companies and others.

The amount set aside for environmental clean-up is not material and is included
in "Accounts payable and accrued expenses" in Statement 3 of the Appendix. If a
range of liability estimates is available on a particular site, we accrue the
lower end of that range.

We cannot estimate costs on sites in the very early stages of clean-up.
Currently, we have five of these sites and there is no more than a remote chance
that a material amount for clean-up will be required.

A specific matter involving the United States Enviromental Protection Agency is 
discussed under Item 7 to this Form 10-K.

Item 1a.  Executive Officers of the Registrant as of December 31, 1997

 
                                                                          Page 5

 
 

Item 2.  Properties.


General Information
- -------------------
Caterpillar's operations are highly integrated. Although the majority of our
plants are involved primarily in the production of either machines or engines,
several plants are involved in the manufacture of both. In addition, several
plants are involved in the manufacture of components which are used in the
assembly of both machines and engines. Caterpillar's distribution centers and
regional distribution centers are involved in the storage and distribution of
parts for machines and engines. Also, the research and development activities
carried on at the Technical Center involve both machines and engines.

Properties we own are believed to be generally well maintained and adequate for
present use. Through planned capital expenditures, we expect these properties to
remain adequate for future needs. Properties we lease are covered by leases
expiring over terms of generally 1 to 10 years. We anticipate no difficulty in
retaining occupancy of any leased facilities, either by renewing leases prior to
expiration or by replacing them with equivalent leased facilities.

                                                                          Page 6

 
Consolidations, Closures, and Sales
- -----------------------------------
Over the last five years, in the ordinary course of business, we have
consolidated operations and/or closed a number of facilities. In March 1996, we
announced that the Precision Barstock Products business unit in York,
Pennsylvania would be closed. We are currently in the process of closing the
unit. Additional information regarding plant closing and consolidation costs is
incorporated by reference from Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on page A-16 of the Appendix.


Headquarters
- ------------
Our corporate headquarters are in Peoria, Illinois. Additional marketing
headquarters are located both inside and outside the United States. The
Financial Products Division is headquartered in leased offices located in
Nashville, Tennessee.


Distribution
- ------------
Distribution of our products is conducted from Distribution and Regional
Distribution Centers inside and outside the United States. Caterpillar Logistics
Services, Inc. distributes other companies' products utilizing certain of our
distribution facilities as well as other non-Caterpillar facilities located both
inside and outside the United States. We also own or lease other storage
facilities which support distribution activities.


Technical Center, Training/Demonstration Areas and Proving Grounds
- ------------------------------------------------------------------
We own a Technical Center located in Mossville, Illinois and various other
training/demonstration areas and proving grounds located both inside and outside
the United States.


Changes in Fixed Assets
- -----------------------
During the five years ended December 31, 1997, changes in our investment in
property, plant and equipment were as follows (stated in millions of dollars):

 

At December 31, 1997, the net book value of properties located outside the
United States represented 26.9% of the net properties on the consolidated
financial position. Additional information about our investment in plant,
property and equipment is incorporated by reference from Notes 1D and 8 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages A-7 and A-12, respectively,
of the Appendix.

                                                                          Page 7

 
Manufacturing, Remanufacturing, and Overhaul
- --------------------------------------------
Manufacturing, remanufacturing, and overhaul of our products are conducted at
the following locations. These facilities are believed to be suitable for their
intended purposes with adequate capacities for current and projected needs for
existing products.

 

                                                                          Page 8

 
PART II


Item 5.  Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.

Information required by Item 5 is incorporated by reference from "Common Stock
Price Range" and "Number of Stockholders" on page A-29 and from "Dividends paid
per share of common stock" on page A-25 of the Appendix.

We have eleven employee stock purchase plans administered outside the United
States for our foreign employees. These plans are not registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and are exempt from such registration
pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 1997,
those plans had approximately 2,850 participants in the aggregate. During the
Fourth Quarter of 1997, a total of 59,205 shares of Caterpillar common stock or
foreign denominated equivalents were distributed under the plans.


Item 6.  Selected Financial Data.

Information required by Item 6 is incorporated by reference from the "Five-year
Financial Summary" on page A-19 of the Appendix.


Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations.

Information required by Item 7 is incorporated by reference from the
"Management's Discussion and Analysis" on pages A-20 through A-28 of the
Appendix, except as modified and updated by the following:


Environmental Matter
- --------------------
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued conditional
certificates of conformity with the Clean Air Act for Caterpillar's 1998 model
year heavy-duty diesel engines. The EPA has issued similar conditional
certificates to other heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers as well. The EPA is
reviewing the impact of advanced electronic control technologies on the
emissions compliance of heavy-duty trucks in certain operating conditions and
whether the use of such technologies is consistent with the Clean Air Act's
requirements. Caterpillar and the other manufacturers are responding to the EPA
requests for information and are engaged in discussions with them and the United
States Department of Justice in an effort to resolve this issue. We believe an
amicable solution will be reached that will not have a material adverse impact
on our financial position or results of operations. If we are unable to reach
such an agreement and do not prevail on legal challenges to the government's
position in that event, resolution of this matter could have a material adverse
effect.


Year 2000
- ---------
We recognize customers and shareholders are concerned about product and service
readiness leading up to and after the turn of the century. We define year 2000
readiness as having systems in place that will not be adversely affected by
dates prior to, during or after the year 2000. We are taking the actions
necessary to ensure our products and services will continue to operate on and
after Jan. 1, 2000. 
                                                                          Page 9

 
We have charged managers from each division with responsibility to identify,
evaluate and implement changes to computer systems and applications necessary to
achieve year 2000 readiness with the goal of having no effect on customers or
disruption to business operations. Each division has identified major areas of
potential business impact. These areas have been evaluated and conversion
efforts are in process. Additionally, each division is responsible for
communicating with suppliers, financial institutions and others it does business
with to coordinate year 2000 readiness. These discussions and conversion efforts
are also in process.

Based on the steps we are taking to address this issue and our progress to date,
as well as our estimated cost of remediation, we do not expect the financial
impact of Year 2000 date conversion to be material to our financial position or
results of operations. If, however, modifications and conversions by us, or
those with which we do business, especially foreign and domestic governments and
their agencies, are not made in a timely manner, this matter could have a
material adverse impact on our financial position or results.


Labor Agreement
- ---------------
On March 22, 1998, employees represented by the United Automobile, Aerospace and
Agricultural Implement Workers of America ("UAW") ratified a new six-year labor
agreement with Caterpillar. We believe the new contract preserves Caterpillar's
right to manage key issues and remain globally competitive, while at the same
time providing employees with an excellent compensation and benefits package.
