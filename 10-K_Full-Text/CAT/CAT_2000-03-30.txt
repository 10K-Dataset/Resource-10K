Principal Lines of Business

Caterpillar operates in three principal lines of business:

1.

Machinery

—

design, manufacture, and
      marketing of construction, mining, agricultural, and forestry machinery
      — track and wheel tractors, track and wheel loaders, pipelayers,
      motor graders, wheel tractor-scrapers, track and wheel excavators,
      backhoe loaders, mining shovels, log skidders, log loaders, off-highway
      trucks, articulated trucks, paving products, telescopic handlers, skid
      steer loaders, and related parts.

2.

Engines

—

design, manufacture, and
      marketing of engines for Caterpillar

Machinery,

on-highway trucks
      and locomotives; marine, petroleum, construction, industrial,
      agricultural, and other applications; electric power generation systems;
      and related parts. Reciprocating engines meet power needs ranging from 5
      to over 21,000 horsepower (4 to over 15 660 kilowatts). Turbines range
      from 1,340 to 18,000 horsepower (1000 to 13 500 kilowatts).

3.

Financial Products

—

financing to
      customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and
      noncompetitive related equipment, as well as some financing for
      Caterpillar sales to dealers. Also provides various forms of insurance to
      customers and dealers to help support the purchase and lease of our
      equipment. This line of business consists primarily of Caterpillar
      Financial Services Corporation and its subsidiaries and Caterpillar
      Insurance Services Corporation.

Due to financial information required by Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an
      Enterprise and Related Information,

we have also divided our business
      into eight operating segments for financial reporting purposes.
      Information about our operating segments, including geographic
      information, is incorporated by reference from Note 20 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements on pages A-16 through A-19 of the
      Appendix.

Nature of Operations

We conduct operations in our

Machinery and Engines’

lines of business under highly competitive conditions, including
      intense price competition. In 1999, price competition, among other
      factors such as lower sales volume and an unfavorable change in product
      sales mix, had a significant negative impact on our profitability for the
      year.

We place great emphasis upon the high quality and performance of our
      products and our dealers’ service support. Although no one
      competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of machines and
      engines, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete
      with us in the sale of each of our products.

Page 1

Our

Financial Products’

line of business also conducts
      business under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of
      Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive
      sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.
      We emphasize prompt and responsive service to meet customer requirements
      and offer various financing plans designed to increase the opportunity
      for sales of our products and generate financing income for our company.

Financial Products’

activity is primarily conducted in the
      United States, with additional offices in Asia, Australia, Canada,
      Europe, and Latin America.

Information about our operations in 1999 and outlook for 2000,
      including risks associated with foreign operations, are incorporated by
      reference from “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” on
      pages A-21 through A-29 of the Appendix.

Acquisitions

During the second quarter of 1999 we acquired the remaining 51%
      interest in F.G. Wilson. F.G. Wilson is a leading packager of
      diesel-powered generator sets. During the first quarter of 1998, we
      acquired the net assets of Perkins Ltd. and the stock of several related
      subsidiaries for $1.328 billion. Perkins is a leading manufacturer of
      small- to medium-sized engines. Both acquisitions were accounted for
      using the purchase method of accounting.

Dealers

Machines are distributed principally through a worldwide
      organization of dealers, 63 located in the United States and 144 located
      outside the United States. Worldwide, these dealers have more than 1,800
      places of business and serve 172 countries. Reciprocating engines are
      sold principally through the worldwide dealer organization and to other
      manufacturers for use in products manufactured by them. Some of the
      reciprocating engines manufactured by Perkins are also sold through their
      worldwide distributor network. Our dealers do not deal exclusively with
      our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products
      are our dealers’ principal business. Turbines and large marine
      reciprocating engines are sold through sales forces employed by Solar and
      MaK, respectively. Occasionally, these employees are assisted by
      independent sales representatives.

Patents and Trademarks

Our products are sold primarily under the marks “Caterpillar,
      ” “Cat,” design versions of “Cat” and
      “Caterpillar,” “Solar,” “Barber-Greene,”
      “MaK,” “Perkins,” “F.G. Wilson,” and
      “Olympian.” We own a number of patents and trademarks relating
      to the products we manufacture, which have been obtained over a period of
      years. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of
      our business and may continue to be of value in the future. We do not
      regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or
      group of patents.

Page 2

Research and Development

We have always placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research
      and engineering relating to the development of new or improved machines,
      engines and major components. In 1999, 1998, and 1997, we spent $814
      million, $838 million, and $700 million, respectively, on our research
      and engineering programs. Of these amounts, $626 million in 1999, $643
      million in 1998, and $528 million in 1997 were attributable to new prime
      products, major component development and major improvements to existing
      products. The remainders were attributable to engineering costs incurred
      during the early production phase as well as ongoing efforts to improve
      existing products.

Employment

At December 31, 1999, we employed 66,896 persons of whom 28,517 were
      located outside the United States.

Sales

Sales outside the United States were 50% of consolidated sales for
      1999, 49% for 1998, and 51% for 1997.

Environmental Matters

The company is regulated by federal, state, and international
      environmental laws governing our use of substances and control of
      emissions. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material
      impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

We are cleaning up hazardous waste at a number of locations, often
      with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is
      likely we will pay clean-up costs at a site and those costs can be
      estimated, the costs are charged against our earnings. In doing that
      estimate, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from
      insurance companies and others.

The amount set aside for environmental clean-up is not material and
      is included in “Accrued expenses” in Statement 3 of the
      Appendix. If a range of liability estimates is available on a particular
      site, we accrue the lower end of that range.

We cannot estimate costs on sites in the very early stages of
      clean-up. Currently, we have five of these sites and there is no more
      than a remote chance that a material amount for clean-up will be
      required.

Item 2. Properties.

General Information

Caterpillar’s operations are highly integrated. Although the
      majority of our plants are involved primarily in the production of either
      machines or engines, several plants are involved in the manufacture of
      both. In addition, several plants are involved in the manufacture of
      components which are used in the assembly of both machines and engines.
      Caterpillar’s parts distribution centers are involved in the storage
      and distribution of parts for machines and engines. Also, the research
      and development activities carried on at the Technical Center involve
      both machines and engines.

Properties we own are believed to be generally well maintained and
      adequate for present use. Through planned capital expenditures, we expect
      these properties to remain adequate for future needs. Properties we lease
      are covered by leases expiring over terms of generally 1 to 10 years. We
      anticipate no difficulty in retaining occupancy of any leased facilities,
      either by renewing leases prior to expiration or by replacing them with
      equivalent leased facilities.

Plant Closings

Information regarding plant closing costs is incorporated by
      reference from Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      on page A-16 of the Appendix.

Headquarters

Our corporate headquarters are in Peoria, Illinois. Additional
      marketing headquarters are located both inside and outside the United
      States. The Financial Products Division is headquartered in leased
      offices located in Nashville, Tennessee.

Distribution

Distribution of our products is conducted from parts distribution
      centers inside and outside the United States. Caterpillar Logistics
      Services, Inc. distributes other companies’ products utilizing
      certain of our distribution facilities as well as other non-Caterpillar
      facilities located both inside and outside the United States. We also own
      or lease other storage facilities which support distribution activities.

Changes in Fixed Assets

During the five years ended December 31, 1999, changes in our
      investment in property, plant and equipment were as follows (stated in
      millions of dollars):

(1)

Prior to 1996, Acquisition amounts, if any, are included with
      Expenditures.

Page 6

At December 31, 1999, the net book value of properties located
      outside the United States represented 28.5% of the net book value of all
      properties reflected in our consolidated financial position. Additional
      information about our investment in property, plant and equipment is
      incorporated by reference from Note 1E on page A-7 and Note 9 on page
      A-12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Appendix.

Technical Center, Training Centers, Demonstration Areas, and
      Proving Grounds

We own a Technical Center located in Mossville, Illinois and various
      other training centers, demonstration areas, and proving grounds located
      both inside and outside the United States.

Manufacturing, Remanufacturing, and
      Overhaul

Manufacturing, remanufacturing, and overhaul of our products are
      conducted at the following locations. These facilities are believed to be
      suitable for their intended purposes with adequate capacities for current
      and projected needs for existing products.

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related
      Stockholder Matters.

Information required by Item 5 is incorporated by reference from
      “Price Ranges” and “Number of Stockholders” on page
      A-30 and from “Dividends declared per share of common stock” on
      page A-20 of the Appendix.

Non-U.S. Employee Stock Purchase Plans

We have twenty employee stock purchase plans administered outside
      the United States for our foreign employees. As of December 31, 1999,
      those plans had approximately 5,279 participants in the aggregate. During
      the fourth quarter of 1999, a total of 26,061 shares of Caterpillar
      common stock or foreign denominated equivalents were distributed under
      the plans.

Put Options

In conjunction with its stock repurchase program, Caterpillar sells
      put options to independent third parties on a private basis. These put
      options entitle the holders to sell shares of Caterpillar common stock to
      the Company on certain dates at specified prices. On December 31, 1999,
      237,500 put options were outstanding with exercise prices ranging from
      $42.48 to $52.10 per share. The put options expired between February 4,
      2000 and March 10, 2000, and were exercised by the holders on their
      expiration dates. During the fourth quarter of 1999, Caterpillar received
      $.4 million in proceeds from the sale of put options.

Certain statements contained in our Management's Discussion and
      Analysis are forward looking and involve uncertainties that could
      significantly impact expected results. The words "believes,"
      "expects," "estimates," "anticipates,"
      "will be" and similar words or expressions identify
      forward-looking statements made on behalf of Caterpillar. Uncertainties
      include factors that affect all international businesses, as well as
      matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves.

Current Outlook

Our current outlook calls for recovery to continue throughout Asia
      and Latin America. Africa and Middle East also should register improved
      growth in 2000. If, for any reason, these recoveries falter, sales would
      likely be lower than anticipated in the affected region. Renewed currency
      speculation, a significant decline in the stock market (in the region or
      in the U.S.), political disruption or much higher interest rates (in the
      region or in the U.S.) could result in weaker than anticipated economic
      growth and sales. Economic recovery could also be delayed or weakened by
      growing budget or current account deficits or inappropriate government
      policies.

In particular, our outlook assumes that the Japanese government
      remains committed to stimulating the economy and that the Brazilian
      government follows through with promised reforms. A reversal by either
      government could result in renewed recession. Our outlook also assumes
      that currency and stock markets remain relatively stable. If currency or
      stock markets were to decline significantly, uncertainty would increase
      and interest rates could move higher, both of which would probably result
      in slower economic growth and lower sales.

The outlook for our sales also depends on commodity prices, most
      of which are expected to trend slightly higher through 2000 but remain
      considerably below 1999 levels. Oil prices have moved up considerably
      since the start of last year and are expected to decline some from recent
      highs. Gold prices moved higher last year on announcements of government
      plans to refrain from selling gold, and we assume gold prices average
      about $300 per ounce in 2000. Agricultural prices are likely to remain
      weak while most metals prices should be up slightly. Based on this
      forecast of only modest improvement in most commodity prices, equipment
      sales into sectors that are sensitive to commodity prices are likely to
      remain relatively weak for 2000.

Stronger than anticipated world growth could lead to noticeable
      improvement in commodity prices which could result in greater than
      expected sales this year. Conversely, weaker than anticipated world
      economic growth could lead to a drop in commodity prices and lower than
      expected sales. Europe plays a key role in this forecast and our current
      outlook is for improvement leading to annual average GDP growth of about
      3%. If Europe falters, then commodity prices could be weaker.

Russia remains very weak. Political and economic instability are
      very high and a further deterioration could impact worldwide stock or
      currency markets, which in turn could weaken Company sales.

Monetary and Fiscal Policies

For most companies operating in a global economy, monetary and
      fiscal policies implemented in the U.S. and abroad could have a
      significant impact on economic growth, and, accordingly, demand for a
      product. For example, if the Federal Reserve raises rates significantly,
      the U.S. economy could slow abruptly leading to an unanticipated decline
      in sales. The United States, in particular, is vulnerable to higher
      interest rates as it enters the tenth year of expansion - which is the
      largest in U.S. history. Our outlook assumes the Federal Reserve will
      raise interest rates 25 to 50 basis points in the first half of the year
      which will contribute to lower industry demand. If the Federal Reserve
      raises rates more that 50 basis points then industry demand will likely
      be even lower resulting in lower company sales.

In general, high interest rates, reductions in government
      spending, higher taxes, significant currency devaluations, and
      uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower
      economic growth and lower industry demand. The current outlook is for
      slightly slower U.S. growth in 2000 and not recession. If, for whatever
      reason, the U.S. were to enter a recession then demand for Company
      products would fall in the U.S. and Canada and would also be lower
      throughout the rest of the world.

Political Factors

Political factors in the U.S. and abroad also have a major impact
      on global companies. The Company is one of the largest U.S. exporters as
      a percentage of sales. International trade and fiscal policies
      implemented in the U.S. this year could impact the Company's ability to
      expand its business abroad. U.S. foreign relations with certain countries
      and any related restrictions imposed could also have a significant impact
      on foreign sales. There are also a number of presidential elections
      scheduled to take place in 2000 which could affect economic policy,
      particularly in Latin America.

Currency Fluctuations

Currency fluctuations are also a significant unknown for global
      companies. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the
      Company's ability to realize price increases on sales could be negatively
      impacted. Most of the Company's key competitors have their principal
      manufacturing operations based in Japan or European countries. The
      majority of our manufacturing assets are in the United States.
      Consequently, an overvalued dollar makes our costs relatively higher
      compared with these competitors. As a major net exporter from the United
      States, an overvalued dollar, over time, could have an unfavorable impact
      on our global competitive position.

Dealer Practices

In addition to these factors, there are uncertainties related to
      the Company's industry and specific operations. A major factor
      contributing to the Company's success is its dealer distribution network.
      Dealer practices, such as changes in inventory levels for both new and
      rental equipment, are not within the Company's control (primarily because
      these practices depend upon the dealer's assessment of anticipated sales
      and the appropriate level of inventory) and may have a significant
      positive or negative impact on our results. In particular, the outlook
      assumes that inventory sales ratios will be somewhat lower at the end of
      2000 than at the end of 1999. If dealers reduce inventory levels more
      than anticipated, company sales will be adversely impacted.

Other Factors

The rate of infrastructure spending, housing starts, commercial
      construction and mining also play a significant role in the Company's
      results. Our products are an integral component of these activities and
      as these activities increase or decrease in the U.S. or abroad, demand
      for our products may be significantly impacted. In 1999, the six-year
      Federal highway bill did not boost U.S. sales as much as anticipated due
      to delays in getting major capital projects underway. If, unexpectedly,
      these delays continued in the Year 2000, sales could be negatively
      impacted.

Another factor which can impact company sales and profit is mix.
      Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales (higher priced
      areas vs. lower priced areas) as well as a product mix of sales (machines
      vs. engines, small vs. large, high margin vs. low margin). Results may be
      impacted positively or negatively by changes in the mix.

The Company operates in a highly competitive environment and our
      outlook depends on a forecast of the Company's percentage of industry
      sales. A reduction in that percentage could result from pricing or
      product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or
      manufacturing difficulties, a failure to price the product competitively,
      or an unexpected buildup in competitors' new machine or dealer owned
      rental fleets.

The outlook also depends on our ability to realize price
      increases. The environment remains very competitive and a repeat of the
      price discounting that occurred in 1998 and 1999 would result in lower
      than anticipated price realization.

This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is
      designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook.
      Obvious factors such as general economic conditions throughout the world
      do not warrant further discussion but are noted to further emphasize the
      myriad of contingencies that may cause the Company's actual results to
      differ from those currently anticipated.
