Competitive
      Environment

Caterpillar
      products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of
      highly competitive markets. In all markets, we compete on the basis of product
      performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the
      intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry
      or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively
      impact operating profit.

Outside
      of the
      United States, certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to
      operating in their home countries.

Machinery

The
      competitive
      environment for Caterpillar’s machinery business consists of some global
      competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of
      global competitors include but are not limited to Komatsu Ltd., Volvo
      Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group AB), CNH Global N.V., Hitachi
      Construction Machinery Co., Terex Corporation, JCB and Ingersoll-Rand Company
      Limited. Each have varying numbers of product lines that compete with
      Caterpillar product lines, and each have varying degrees of regional focus.
      John
      Deere Construction and Forestry Division (part of Deere & Co.), for example,
      has numerous product lines that compete with Caterpillar primarily in North
      America and Latin America. Others, like Ingersoll-Rand, offer a limited range
      of
      products that compete against Caterpillar, but do compete globally.

During
      2006, global
      industry demand continued to be strong and most competitors experienced
      increased sales and operating profit. Also in 2006, off-highway emissions
      regulations in Europe, North America and Japan required Caterpillar and its
      competitors to introduce products with emissions-compliant engines in a certain
      horsepower range. In some cases, competitors also timed product upgrades to
      coincide with these emissions requirements. The overall competitive environment
      in the machinery business continues to be intense, and the overall financial
      health of the industry continues to improve.

Caterpillar's
      logistics business provides integrated supply chain services for Caterpillar
      and
      over 60 other companies worldwide. It competes with global, regional and local
      competitors, including companies such as DHL and UPS. The unit has grown rapidly
      since its inception in 1987, and the contract logistics industry is expected
      to
      continue to grow at rates above that of the global economy as a
      whole.

Progress
      Rail (a
      newly acquired business) has achieved a leading market position in North America
      as a provider of a broad range of products and services for both railroad
      rolling stock and the railroad track infrastructure and a supplier of
      reconditioned and remanufactured railroad freight car and locomotive components.
      Progress Rail leverages its extensive network of plant and service facilities
      to
      provide customers high quality products and services with lower shipping costs
      and faster turnaround times. These elements, along with Progress Rail’s ability
      to source a substantial volume of reconditionable parts to its railcar and
      locomotive remanufacturing operations, provide Progress Rail with a sustainable
      cost advantage and competitive prices for its customers.

Engines

Caterpillar
      operates in a very competitive engine/turbine manufacturing and packaging
      environment. The company manufactures diesel, heavy fuel and natural gas
      reciprocating engines for the on- and off-highway markets, and provides
      industrial turbines and turbine related services for oil and gas and power
      generation applications. Caterpillar designs, manufactures, assembles and
      distributes electrical generator sets and compression packages that can be
      customized with a wide range of ancillary equipment and performance options
      to
      create fully integrated electric power and compression systems.

Page

The
      competitive
      environment for off-highway engines/turbines and generator sets consists of
      a
      few global competitors who compete in a variety of Caterpillar’s markets, and a
      larger set of companies who compete in a limited size range and/or application.
      Principal global competitors include, but are not limited to, Cummins Inc.,
      MTU
      Friedrichshafen and MTU Detroit Diesel (both part of Tognum GmbH) and Wartsila
      Corp. Other competitors, such as John Deere Power Systems (part of Deere &
Co.), Siemens Power Generation (part of Siemens AG), General Electric Company
      and Volvo Penta (part of Volvo Group AB) compete in a portion of Caterpillar’s
      markets. An additional set of competitors, including Generac Power Systems,
      Inc., Kohler Co. and others, are packagers who source engines and/or other
      components from domestic and international suppliers, and market products
      regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution
      channels.

In
      the North
      American on-highway heavy-duty and mid-range diesel engine markets, competitors
      include, but are not limited to, Cummins Inc.,

Detroit
      Diesel
      Corp. and Mercedes-Benz (both part of DaimlerChrysler AG), Navistar
      International

Corp.
      and

Volvo
      Group AB

.
      O

n-highway
      diesel
      engine competitors in overseas markets include, but are not limited to,
      Mercedes-Benz and Mitsubishi Fuso Truck & Bus Corp. (both part of Daimler
      Chrysler AG), Iveco Motors (part of Fiat S.p.A), MAN AG, Scania AB and Volvo
      Group AB. Some of these competitors are truck and/or bus manufacturers with
      proprietary diesel engines who also offer engines from independent manufacturers
      such as Caterpillar.

During
      2006,
      on-highway engine competitors worked to meet strong global demand for their
      products while, in North America, preparing to meet tightening January 1, 2007,
      United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions
      requirements.

During
      2006,
      Caterpillar continued in its leadership position in the North American
      on-highway truck market. Since the introduction of its five engine models with
      ACERT® Technology beginning in 2003, the company has shipped over 450,000 ACERT
      engines into the North American on-highway truck market and continued to
      maintain its leadership position in this market. Customer acceptance of
      Caterpillar ACERT engine performance, quality and reliability is strong, as
      evidenced by an unprecedented sixth J.D. Power and Associates
      Award.

Caterpillar
      received EPA certification for the C7, C13 and C15 ACERT engines in November
      2006. The C9 ACERT engine EPA application was recently submitted, and
      certification is expected in early 2007.

Caterpillar
      also
      continued to focus investment and resources on leveraging ACERT Technology
      into
      off-road markets, as well as into more of its engine platforms. The building
      blocks for ACERT Technology are very flexible and scaleable and are being
      applied as needed based on engine platform and application. From October 2004
      through year-end 2006, the company has shipped over 30,000 Caterpillar machines
      powered by engines with ACERT Technology. A line of ACERT industrial, electric
      power and marine engines has been released to further leverage the technology
      throughout Caterpillar’s businesses and engine platforms. Caterpillar was the
      first company to offer a full line of Tier 3/Stage IIIA emissions compliant
      off-highway engines.

Our
      2007 on-highway
      ACERT engines have been validated in the field to meet the new emissions
      regulations while maintaining the fuel economy and durability characteristics
      of
      our current on-highway engines. The 2007 production engines began shipping
      in
      January with volumes to increase throughout the year. The ACERT Technologies
      in
      this product were expanded to include the aftertreatment system. Caterpillar
      Environmental Technologies Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. was formed to design and
      manufacture the diesel particulate filter (DPF).

We
      believe ACERT
      provides Caterpillar a valuable foundation now and in the future to meet
      emissions and performance requirements, and we plan to continue investing in
      developing and leveraging ACERT Technology systems and components.

Caterpillar’s
      remanufacturing business provides services for a variety of products and
      services to Caterpillar and other external clients. The remanufacturing business
      competes on a regional basis with similarly sized or smaller companies. The
      company launched the remanufacturing business in the 1970s with engines/turbines
      and is now one of the world’s largest remanufacturers, processing more than two
      million units annually and recycling more than 100 million pounds of
      remanufactured products each year. The business continues to grow at rates
      well
      above that of the global economy as a whole.

                          Products

Cat
      Financial,
      incorporated in Delaware, is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar.
      Cat Financial's primary business is to provide retail financing alternatives
      for
      Caterpillar products to customers and Caterpillar dealers around the world.
      Such
      retail financing is primarily comprised of financing of Caterpillar equipment,
      machinery and engines. In addition, Cat Financial also provides financing for
      vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases,
      incorporate Caterpillar products.

In addition to
      retail financing,

Cat
      Financial
      provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term
      dealer receivables from Caterpillar.

The
      various

The
      retail
      financing business is highly competitive, with financing for users of
      Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally
      commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financial's competitors
      include CIT Group Inc.; CitiCapital, a business unit of Citigroup; General
      Electric Capital Corporation and local banks and finance companies. In addition,
      many of our manufacturing competitors use below-market interest rate programs
      (subsidized by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat
      Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising
      programs around the world to respond to these competing offers.

Cat
      Financial's
      results are largely dependent upon Caterpillar dealers' ability to sell
      equipment and customers' willingness to enter into financing or leasing
      agreements. It is also affected by the availability of funds from its financing
      sources and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest
      rates.

Cat
      Financial has a
      "match funding" policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the
      interest rate profile (fixed rate or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with
      the interest rate profile of its receivable portfolio (loans and leases with
      customers and dealers) within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In
      connection with that policy, Cat Financial issues debt with a similar interest
      rate profile to its receivables, and also uses interest rate swap agreements
      to
      manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some
      cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds. For more information regarding match
      funding, please see Note 3 - “Derivative financial instruments and risk
      management” of Exhibit 13.

In
      managing foreign
      currency risk for Cat Financial's operations, the objective is to minimize
      earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net
      foreign currency balance sheet positions. This policy allows the use of foreign
      currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency mismatch
      between the receivable and debt portfolios. None of these foreign currency

Cat
      Financial
      provides financing only when acceptable criteria are met. Credit decisions
      are
      based on, among other things, the customer's credit history, financial strength
      and equipment application. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest
      in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage
      on
      financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar
      dealers' sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment, especially in North
      America. Cat Financial's competitive position is improved by marketing programs,
      subsidized by Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers, which allow it to offer
      below-market interest rates. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer,
      subsidizes an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial
      then
      recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. Transaction processing
      time and supporting technologies continue to drive Cat Financial in its efforts
      to respond quickly to customers and improve internal processing efficiencies.

Cat
      Power Ventures,
      a wholly owned

subsidiary
      of
      Caterpillar, primarily invested equity and took ownership interests in power
      generation projects throughout the world that utilize Caterpillar power
      generation equipment. In some cases, these projects also utilize construction
      and operations and maintenance services that are provided by other Caterpillar
      subsidiaries. Cat Power Ventures has investments in power projects in Poland,
      the Dominican Republic and Tunisia and has created direct and indirect
      subsidiaries and affiliates to hold these investments. In December 2005, the
      company decided that it would no longer invest equity in power generation
      projects. As a result, Cat Power Ventures will not make any new equity
      investments in power generation projects and will sell its project investment
      portfolio. We expect these sales to be completed and for Cat Power Ventures
      to
      have ceased operations by the end of 2007.

Business
      Developments in 2006

In
      2006, the
      company

continued to focus
      on execution of our Vision 2020 strategy that was introduced in 2005. Through
      Vision 2020, we established key enterprise goals for 2010 grouped under the
      “3Ps” of people, performance and profitable growth. Our people goals include a
      highly engaged workforce and world-class safety. The performance goals are
      related to improved quality and market leadership in every major product group
      we serve. The profitable growth goals include a 2010 sales and revenues target.

Performance
      and Strategy

      marked the
      fourth straight year of double-digit profit growth and the third consecutive
      year of record sales and profit for Caterpillar, including 2006 sales and
      revenues of $41.517 billion and profit of $3.537 billion, or $5.17 per
      share.

In
      November 2006,
      the company’s Chairman and CEO, Jim Owens, updated analysts and investors on
      execution of the company’s strategy. Highlights of the update included: line of
      sight to $50+ billion of sales and revenues by 2010; profit per share growth
      in
      a range of 15 to 20 percent through 2010; strong cash flow through the end
      of
      the decade to fund continued growth and reward stockholders with continued
      dividend growth; strong internal focus on safety, quality and velocity with
      implementation of the Caterpillar Production System; continued focus on
      products, technology, and product support to deliver the best value to
      customers; and continued growth in the company’s less cyclical service-related
      businesses.

Page

In
      October 2006,
      the company announced plans to realign core manufacturing operations and to
      focus product design expertise on key industry segments. To achieve these goals,
      the company created three new divisions: the U.S. Operations Division; the
      Heavy
      Construction and Mining Division and the Infrastructure Development Division.
      The new divisions resulted from restructuring what was known as Wheel Loaders
      & Excavators Division, Track-Type Tractors Division, and Mining &
Construction Equipment Division. The new alignment will maximize the company's
      manufacturing synergies and support the company's vision for unmatched quality,
      velocity and safety.

Sustainability

In
      2006, the
      company released its first-ever Sustainability Report to highlight the company's
      efforts in sustainable development and its commitment to make sustainable
      development a "strategic area of improvement" in its new enterprise strategy.
      The company was selected as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability World
      Index
      (DJSI World) for the sixth consecutive year. DJSI uses a best-in-class approach
      designed to identify best practices across the economic, social and
      environmental dimensions of corporate sustainability.

In
      November 2006,
      the company received certification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
      (EPA) for the company’s C7, C13 and C15 engines equipped with ACERT Technology
      for 2007. This technology positions the company to meet future EPA emissions
      regulations and provides a long-term emissions solution for the global
      on-highway engine market. ACERT Technology relies on four basic systems —
emissions air management, precision combustion, advanced electronics and
      effective aftertreatment. These four systems work to decrease particulate
      matter, oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbon emissions, while preserving the
      engine’s reliability and durability, which keep owning and operating costs low.

Customer
      acceptance
      of Cat engines is reflected in the company’s unprecedented sixth J.D. Power and
      Associates Award, which the company received in 2006 for “Highest Customer
      Satisfaction With Vocational Heavy Duty Diesel Engines.”  No other engine
      manufacturer has ever won this customer feedback award, which measures customer
      satisfaction through J.D. Power’s annual survey of vehicle owners who operate in
      typically rugged vocations and use vehicles such as dump trucks or garbage
      trucks.

Growth
      in
      China

In
      2006, the
      company made progress toward its

commitment
      to
      continue expansion of our business in China in support of our overall enterprise
      strategy and Vision 2020. Caterpillar held “CONEXPO Asia 2006,” an international
      trade show for the construction industry, at the China National Agricultural
      Exhibition Center in Beijing. Also, the company relocated its Asia Pacific
      Operations headquarters from Tokyo, Japan, to Beijing, China. These activities
      support operational and sales success in China, which is a critical success
      factor for the company's long-term growth and profitability.

The
      company further
      expanded its business in China by signing an investment agreement with the
      Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee to begin construction of a
      new
      wheel loader manufacturing facility in the Suzhou Industrial Park in China’s
      Jiangsu province. The company

also signed a
      letter of intent with China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)

through
      which
      Caterpillar and NDRC will promote the development of China's remanufacturing
      industry. As part of the letter of intent, the company will provide expertise
      to
      assist NDRC and Chinese research institutions in supporting the development
      of
      the remanufacturing industry in China. The company and NDRC also agreed to
      form
      a Joint Working Group on Remanufacturing Programs to discuss matters related
      to
      the remanufacturing cooperation program in detail and to coordinate and promote
      further cooperation by both parties in sustainable manufacturing and other
      areas.

Caterpillar
      (China)
      Machinery Components Co., Ltd. in Wuxi began shipping hose and coupling
      assemblies in 2006, with valve production for SEM-built wheel loaders and
      Xuzhou-built motor graders scheduled to begin in late 2007.

Cat
      Logistics
      opened a new China Distribution Center in the Lingang Industrial Area in
      Shanghai. The distribution center provides parts for the company’s dealers in
      China and expanded parts distribution to dealers in Korea and Mongolia.

Solar
      Turbines and
      China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) signed a long-term strategic
      agreement between the two companies. Under terms of the strategic agreement,
      Solar Turbines will be a CNOOC preferred aftermarket supplier for goods and
      services for Solar Gas Turbines equipment.

Acquisitions/Alliances

In
      2006, the
      company continued its efforts to profitably grow its business. These efforts
      include the following:

·

The
                company
                announced plans to significantly increase the number of Cat-branded
                machines available to the Caterpillar dealer network for marketing
                to the
                forestry industry. Pursuant to the agreement with alliance partner
                Blount
                International, Inc. (Blount), the company is replacing the current
                Timberking

TM

brand name
                with the Caterpillar

brands. The
                Timberking line includes products manufactured by both the company
                and
                Blount and sold exclusively through the company’s dealers.

·

The
                company
                acquired Progress Rail for $1.0 billion in cash, stock and assumption
                of
                debt. Progress Rail is based in Albertville, Alabama, and is a leading
                provider of remanufactured locomotive and railcar products and services
                to
                the North American railroad industry. The rail aftermarket services
                business is a strong fit with the company’s strategic direction and
                leverages the company’s remanufacturing capability. The acquisition
                provided excellent diversified growth to the company, enhancing its
                ability to deliver attractive profitability throughout the business
                cycles. Progress Rail offers a full range of reconditioned and
                remanufactured railcar components, rail and track products, railcar
                and
                locomotive repair, rail welding, maintenance of way equipment and
                railcar

As
                part of
                the company’s plan to improve operational excellence in Asia, the company
                completed the acquisition of a former joint venture engine operation
                in
                India. The joint venture was originally formed in 1988 as Hindustan
                PowerPlus Limited. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the company
                and
                has been renamed Caterpillar Power India Private Limited. The acquisition
                aligns operations in India more closely with the other power systems
                groups that are part of the global Caterpillar family.

Acquisitions

Information
      related
      to acquisitions appears in Note 25 - “

Alliances
      and
      Acquisitions”

of Exhibit
      13.

Order
      Backlog

The
      dollar amount
      of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $14.5 billion at December
      31,
      2006, and $12.2 billion at December 31, 2005. Of the total backlog,
      approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2006, and $1.7 billion at December
      31, 2005, was not expected to be filled in the following year. Our backlog
      is
      generally highest in the first and second quarters because of seasonal buying
      trends in our industry.

Dealers

Our
      machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of
      independent dealers (dealer network

),


located in the United States and 128 located outside the United States.
      Worldwide, these dealers serve 182 countries and

operate

3,576

places of business, including

1,639

dealer
      rental outlets.

Reciprocating
      engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other
      manufacturers for use in their products. Some of the reciprocating engines
      manufactured by Perkins Engines Company Limited (Perkins) also are sold through
      a worldwide network of 132 distributors located in 181 countries. Most of the
      electric power generation systems manufactured by FG Wilson are sold through
      a
      worldwide network of 200 dealers located in 180 countries.

These
      dealers do
      not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and
      servicing of our products are the dealers' principal businesses. Turbines and
      large marine and large power generation reciprocating engines are sold through
      sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted
      by
      independent sales representatives.

The
      company's
      relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard
      sales and service agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the company grants
      the
      dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products
      in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established
      by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing
      in
      the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property
      and
      to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further
      grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the company's trademarks,
      service marks and brand names. In some instances a separate trademark agreement
      exists between the company and a dealer.

Page

In
      exchange for
      these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the
      sale
      of the company's products to current and prospective customers in the dealer's
      service territory. Each dealer specifically agrees to employ adequate sales
      and
      support personnel to market, sell and promote the company's products,
      demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the company's product improvement
      programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the
      safe
      operation of any of the company's products, and maintain detailed books and
      records of the dealer's financial condition, sales and inventories and make
      these books and records available at the company's reasonable request.

These
      sales and
      service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written
      notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for
      bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking
      protection from creditors.

Patents
      and Trademarks

Our
      products are
      sold primarily under the brands "Caterpillar," "CAT," design versions of "CAT"
      and "Caterpillar," "Solar Turbines," "MaK," "Perkins," "FG Wilson" and
      "Olympian." We own a number of patents and trademarks relating to the products
      we manufacture, which have been obtained over a period of years. These patents
      and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue
      to be of value in the future. We do not regard any of our business as being
      dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.

Research
      and Development

We
      have always
      placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating
      to
      the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components.
      In
      2006, 2005 and 2004, we spent $1,347

million,

$1,084 million and
      $928 million, or 3.2 percent, 3.0 percent and 3.1 percent of our sales and
      revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs.

Employment

As
      of December 31,
      2006, we employed 94,593 persons of whom 45,884 were located outside the United
      States. From a global, enterprise perspective, we believe our relationship
      with
      our employees is very good. We build and maintain a productive, motivated
      workforce by treating all employees fairly and equitably.

In
      the United
      States, most of our 48,709 employees are at-will employees and, therefore,
      not
      subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. At select business
      units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment
      contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other
      benefits.

As
      of December 31,
      2006, there were 14,315 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by
      collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The United
      Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)
      represents 12,085 Caterpillar employees under a six-year central labor agreement
      that will expire March 1, 2011. The International Association of Machinists
      (IAM) represents 2,036 employees under labor agreements that expire on April
      30,
      2012, and May 23, 2010.

Outside
      the United
      States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those
      countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions
      of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary
      terms
      in the subject jurisdiction.

Sales

Sales
      outside the
      United States were 54 percent of consolidated sales for 2006

,

53 percent

for
      2005 and 54 percent for 2004

.

Environmental
      Matters

We
      strive to be a
      global leader in sustainability, and we promote enterprise-wide commitment
      to
      sustainable development consistent with our business goals, in line with our
      Vision 2020 strategy.

Page 9

The
      company is
      regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing
      our
      use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition
      to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact
      the
      development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance
      with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines.
      Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital
      expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

We
      are engaged in
      remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies,
      pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial
      costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the costs are
      charged against our earnings. In formulating that estimate, we do not consider
      amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. The amount
      recorded for environmental remediation is not material and

is
      included in
      Statement 2 - “Consolidated Financial Position at December 31 -

Accrued
      Expenses

"

of Exhibit 13.

We
      cannot
      reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation.
      Currently, we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation, and
      there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial
      activities at any individual site, or at all sites in the aggregate, will be
      required.

Item
                    1A. Business Risk
                    Factors.

The
      statements in
      this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should
      be
      considered carefully in conjunction with the

-

“Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis”

of
      Exhibit 13.

In
      addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The discussion and analysis
      in
      this Form 10-K and in our 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders that are
      forward-looking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact
      results. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other
      materials we issue to the public or in the form of oral presentation to the
      public. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of
      future events about the company. You can identify these statements by the fact
      they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such
      as "believe," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "will be," "should," “plan,”
“project,” “intend,” and similar words or expressions that identify
      forward-looking statements made on behalf of Caterpillar.

Page 10

In
      particular,
      these forward-looking statements include statements relating to future actions,
      prospective products, products’ approvals, future performance or results of
      current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates,
      foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies and financial results.
      The
      statements are based on assumptions or on known or unknown risks and
      uncertainties. Although, we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions,
      we
      cannot guarantee the realization of these statements. Achievement of future
      results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate
      assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or
      underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ
      from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Uncertainties
      include factors that affect international businesses, as well as matters
      specific to the company and the markets it serves.

The
      company
      undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether
      as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You may however
      consult any further related disclosures we make in our Form 10-Q or any Form
      8-K
      reports to the SEC.

The
      following is a
      cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe
      are significant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in
      the
      aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from
      expected and past results. You should note it is impossible to predict or
      identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the
      following factors to be a complete discussion of risks and
      uncertainties.

Changes
      in Government Monetary and Fiscal Policies

Most
      countries have
      established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic
      activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect
      overall economic growth, which alter demand for residential and nonresidential
      structures, energy and mined products, which in turn affect sales of our
      products that serve these activities. Also, interest rates affect customers’
abilities to finance machine purchases and can change the optimal time to keep
      machines in a fleet. Our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest
      rates in a number of countries. Interest rates higher than those assumptions
      could result in lower sales than anticipated.

Government
      policies
      on taxes and spending affect our businesses. Throughout the world, government
      spending finances much infrastructure development, such as highways, airports,
      sewer and water systems, and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives
      and the amount of money users can retain, both of which influence investment
      decisions. Developments more unfavorable than anticipated, such as declines
      in
      government revenues, decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes,
      could negatively impact our results.

Government
      can also
      impact international trade and investment through a variety of policies, such
      as
      import quotas, inspections, capital controls or tariffs. Developments worse
      than
      anticipated in the outlook, which could include lower import quotas, more
      detailed inspections or higher tariffs, could negatively impact our
      results.

Environmental
      Regulations

Our
      facilities and
      operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and
      regulations, including laws and regulations governing emissions to air,
      discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation,
      treatment and disposal of general, non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials.
      While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these
      environmental laws and regulations, we cannot ensure that we will not be
      adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing
      or
      subsequently acquired operations, under present laws and regulations or those
      that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Compliance with all aforementioned
      existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures,
      earnings or competitive position.

Particularly
      our
      engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing
      emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory
      agencies in the U.S. and other various regulatory agencies around the world.
      Although current compliance with all existing emissions and noise requirements
      has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or
      competitive position, governments may set new standards that could impact our
      operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy. Thus,
      significant changes in standards, or the adoption of new standards, have the
      potential to impact our results negatively.

Changes
      in Economic Conditions of Industries We Serve

The
      energy and
      mining industries are major users of our machines and engines. Decisions to
      purchase our machines and engines are dependent upon performance of these
      industries. If demand of output in these industries increases, the demand
      for our products would likely increase and vice versa. Prices of commodities
      in
      these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to economic
      growth, commodity inventories and any disruptions in production. We assume
      certain prices for key commodities in preparing our outlooks. Commodity prices
      lower than those assumed have the potential to negatively impact our
      sales.

The
      rates of
      infrastructure spending, housing starts, and commercial construction, play
      a
      significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of
      these
      activities, and as these activities increase or decrease in the U.S. or abroad,
      demand for our products may be significantly impacted.

Changes
      in Price and Significant Shortages of Component Products

We
      are a
      significant user of steel and many commodities required for the manufacture
      of
      our products. So, increases in the prices of such commodities likely would
      boost
      costs higher than expected, negatively impacting profits.

We
      rely on
      suppliers to secure component products, particularly steel, required for the
      manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers
      or
      decreased in availability of such components or commodities could have an
      adverse affect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase
      our operating costs. We believe our source of supply of raw materials will
      be
      generally sufficient for our need in the foreseeable future. However, our
      results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted should
      the supply turn out to be insufficient for our operations.

Currency
      Fluctuations

The
      reporting
      currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets,
      liabilities, expenses and revenues, are denominated in currencies other than
      the
      U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate
      those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the
      applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value
      of
      the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis other currencies or vice versa will affect the amount
      of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value
      has
      not changed in their original currency.

This
      could have
      significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value
      of
      the U.S. dollar or other currencies is substantial

.

Dealer/Original
      Equipment Manufacturers Sourcing Practices

We
      sell finished
      products through an independent dealer network or directly to OEMs. Both carry
      inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those
      inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments can
      impact our results either positively or negatively.

In
      particular, some
      of our engine customers are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture or
      could in the future manufacture engines for their own products. Despite their
      engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen to outsource certain
      types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products
      and
      in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks and maintain company focus.
      However, we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine
      manufacture in the future. Increased levels of production insourcing by these
      customers could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our
      customers’ business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine
      manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet specifications
      and
      the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. A
      significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our
      truck manufacturers or OEM customers could significantly impact our revenues
      and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
      operations and financial condition.

Disease
      Epidemics

Historical
      data
      shows that major flu epidemics often caused sharp drops in economic output.
      Such
      epidemics are difficult to forecast, either in their occurrence or in their
      impact. So, such an event would have the potential to impact our results more
      unfavorably than we would assume in our outlooks.

Page 12

Impact
      of Acquisitions

We
      may from time to
      time engage in acquisitions involving some potential risks, including failure
      to
      successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions.
      For example, with any past or future acquisitions, there is the possibility
      that:

·

the
                    business
                    culture of the acquired business may not match well with our
                    culture;

·

technological
                    and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions
                    may not
                    occur as expected;

·

the
                company
                may acquire or assume unexpected
                liabilities;

·

unforeseen
                difficulties may arise in integrating operations and
                systems;

·

the
                company
                may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired
                business;

·

higher
                than
                expected finance costs due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade,
                environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any
                jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations;
                and

·

the
                company
                may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer
                bases.

Failure
      to continue
      implementing the company’s acquisition strategy, including successfully
      integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our
      business, financial condition and results of operations.

Competition

We
      operate in a
      highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on a forecast of the
      company's share of industry sales predicated on our ability to compete with
      others in the marketplace. The company competes on the basis of product
      performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance
      that
      our product will be able to compete successfully with these other companies.
      Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing
      or
      product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or
      manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively
      or
      an unexpected buildup in competitors' new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets,
      leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used
      equipment prices.

The
      environment
      remains competitive from a pricing standpoint. Our 2007 sales outlook assumes
      that the price increases announced for January 2007 hold in the marketplace.
      While we expect that the environment will continue to absorb these price
      actions, changes in marketplace acceptance would negatively impact our results.
      Moreover, additional price discounting to maintain our competitive position
      could result in lower than anticipated realization.

In
      addition, our
      results and ability to compete may be impacted positively or negatively by
      changes in the sales mix. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales
      as well as a product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected
      geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively
      impacted.

Litigation
      and Contingency

We
      face an inherent
      business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits. We are
      involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty,
      environmental claims and lawsuits, including other legal proceedings that arise
      in the ordinary course of our business. Although, it is not possible to predict
      with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit and the range of probable
      loss, we believe these lawsuits and claims will not individually or in the
      aggregate have a material impact on our results. However, we could in the future
      incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could
      have
      a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.
      In addition, while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain
      claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in
      the
      future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage
      against any such claims.

As
      required by U.S.
      generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves based on our
      assessment of such contingencies. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings,
      may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as
      a
      reserve requiring us to make additional materials payments, which could result
      in an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Page 13

Risks
      to Global Operations

Our
      global
      operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in
      the
      U.S. and internationally, including countries with political and economic
      instability, exposing our business operations to certain political and economic
      risks inherent in operating in some countries. These risks include:

·

changes
                in
                regulations; imposition of currency restrictions and other
                restraints;

·

imposition
                of
                burdensome tariffs and quotas;

·

national
                and
                international conflict, including terrorist acts;
                and

·

economic
                downturns, political instability and war or civil unrest may severely
                disrupt economic activity in affected countries.

As
      a normal
      practice, we do not assume such events in our outlooks unless already happening
      when the outlook is issued. So the occurrence of one of these events has the
      potential to negatively impact our results.

Risks
      to Financial Services Segment

Inherent
      in the
      operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers.
      The
      creditworthiness of each customer, and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions
      and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors,
      including, but not limited to, relevant industry and economic conditions, the
      availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's
      management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value
      of
      the underlying collateral. Additionally, interest rate movements create a degree
      of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments
      and
      the value of our fixed rate debt. Our "match funding" policy addresses interest
      rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of
      our
      debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio
      (loans and leases with customers and dealers) within pre-determined ranges
      on an
      ongoing basis. To achieve our match funding objectives, we issue debt with
      a
      similar interest rate profile to our receivables and also use interest rate
      swap
      agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes
      and in some cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds. If interest rates move
      upward more sharply than anticipated, our financial results could be negatively
      impacted. With respect to our insurance and investment management operations,
      changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value
      of
      our investment portfolio, thus requiring a negative adjustment to
      earnings.

Market
      Acceptance of Products

Our
      business relies
      on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business
      goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and
      customers. This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to
      manage and maintain key dealer relationships and our ability to develop
      effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued
      success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products
      and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the
      development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. Failure
      to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace,
      or
      to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products,
      could
      have material impact on our business.

Item
                      2. Properties.

General
      Information

Caterpillar's
      operations are highly integrated. Although the majority of our plants are
      involved primarily in the production of either machines or engines, several
      plants are involved in the manufacturing of both. In addition, several plants
      are involved in the manufacturing of components which are used in the assembly
      of both machines and engines. Caterpillar's parts distribution centers are
      involved in the storage and distribution of parts for machines and engines.
      Also, the research and development activities carried on at our Technical Center
      (as described below) involve both machines and engines.

Properties
      we own
      are believed to be generally well maintained and adequate for present use.
      Through planned capital expenditures, we expect these properties to remain
      adequate for future needs. Properties we lease are covered by leases expiring
      over terms of generally one to ten years. We anticipate no difficulty in
      retaining occupancy of any leased facilities, either by renewing leases prior
      to
      expiration or by replacing them with equivalent leased facilities.

Headquarters
      and Other Key Offices

Our

Item
                      3. Legal Proceedings.

We
      have disclosed
      certain individual legal proceedings in this filing. Additionally, we are
      involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course
      of
      business. The most prevalent

of
      these unresolved
      actions

involve disputes
      related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including
      claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues
      or
      intellectual property rights. Although it is not possible to predict with
      certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of probable
      loss, we believe that these unresolved legal actions will not individually
      or in
      the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
      position, liquidity or results of operations.

On
      August 24, 2006,
      Caterpillar announced the settlement of all current and pending litigation
      between Navistar International Corporation (Navistar), the parent company of
      International Truck and Engine Corporation, and Caterpillar. As part of the
      litigation settlement, Caterpillar received an up-front cash payment and a
      three-year promissory note from Navistar. Based on Caterpillar’s receivable
      balances related to the Navistar litigation at the time of settlement, the
      settlement resulted in a pre-tax charge to Caterpillar of approximately $70
      million in the third quarter

.

On
      September 29,
      2004, Kruse Technology Partnership (Kruse) filed a lawsuit against Caterpillar
      in the United States District Court for the Central District of California
      alleging that certain Caterpillar engines built from October 2002 to the present
      infringe upon certain claims of three of Kruse's patents on engine fuel
      injection timing and combustion strategies. Kruse seeks monetary damages,
      injunctive relief and a finding that the alleged infringement by Caterpillar
      was
      willful. Caterpillar denies Kruse's allegations, believes they are without
      merit
      and filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration from the court that Caterpillar
      is not infringing upon Kruse's patents and that the patents are invalid and
      unenforceable. The counterclaim filed by Caterpillar is pending, and no trial
      date is currently scheduled. In the opinion of management, the ultimate
      disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our
      consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of
      operations.

In
      November 2004,
      the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) alleged that Caterpillar had
      constructed a facility in Emporia, Kansas, that failed to comply with Section
      112(g)(2)(B) of the federal Clean Air Act. Caterpillar sold the Emporia, Kansas
      facility in December 2002. This matter has been settled and terminated by
      Consent Decree entered on June 12, 2006, in the United States District Court
      for
      the District of Kansas, and Caterpillar’s payment of a civil penalty of $300,000
      on June 14, 2006. Accordingly, in the opinion of our management, this matter
      is
      closed and did not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
      position, liquidity or results of operations.

On
      June 26, 2006,
      the UK Environment Agency filed a claim against Caterpillar Logistics Services
      (UK) Ltd. (CLS) before the Leicester & Rutland Magistrates Court in
      Leicestershire, UK. The complaint alleged that CLS failed to follow UK
      regulations in connection with the handling and disposal of special waste
      (primarily batteries) from January through September 2005. On August 17, 2006,
      CLS was fined £7,763 (approximately $15,000), thereby concluding the
      matter.

The
      World Trade
      Organization (WTO) previously found that the transitional and grandfathering
      provisions for extraterritorial income exclusion (ETI), under the American
      Jobs
      Creation Act of 2004, did not satisfy the United States' obligation to
      "withdraw" prohibited export subsidies. The WTO result allowed the European
      Union to impose already authorized sanctions on certain U.S. origin goods
      beginning May 16, 2006. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act
      of
      2005, signed by President Bush on May 17, 2006, repealed the grandfathering
      provisions for ETI. In response, the European Union Trade Commissioner announced
      the cancellation of sanctions ending the dispute. We were not materially
      impacted by this resolution.

Non-U.S.
      Employee Stock Purchase Plans

We
      have 30 employee
      stock purchase plans administered outside the United States for our foreign
      employees. As of December 31, 2006, those plans had approximately 12,700
      participants in the aggregate. During the fourth quarter of 2006, approximately
      90,500 shares of Caterpillar common stock or foreign denominated equivalents
      were distributed under the plans. Participants in some foreign plans have the
      option of receiving non-U.S. share certificates (foreign-denominated
      equivalents) in lieu of U.S. shares of Caterpillar common stock upon withdrawal
      from the plan. These equivalent certificates are tradable only on the local
      stock market and are included in our determination of shares
      outstanding.

On
                October 8, 2003, the board of directors approved an extension of
                the share
                repurchase program (through October 2008) with the goal of reducing
                the
                company's outstanding shares to 320,000,000. The share repurchase
                program
                goal was adjusted for the stock split announced on June 8, 2005,
                to
                reflect an adjusted goal of 640,000,000 shares outstanding by October
                2008. Amount represents the shares outstanding at the end of the
                period
                covered by this report less 640,000,000. In February 2007, the Board
                of
                Directors authorized a $7.50 billion stock repurchase program over
                the

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial
      Reporting

The
      management of
      Caterpillar Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
      internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial
      reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
      reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial
      statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes
      those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
      that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
      and
      dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
      that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
      statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
      that
      receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
      with
      authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
      reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
      acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
      material effect on the financial statements.

Because
      of its
      inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
      or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
      to
      future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
      because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
      policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness
      of
      the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
      2006.
      In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee
      of
      Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
      Control — Integrated Framework

.
      Based on our
      assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, the company's internal
      control over financial reporting was effective based on those
      criteria.

Management
      has
      excluded Progress Rail Services from our assessment of internal control over
      financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 because we acquired Progress Rail
      Services on June 19, 2006. Progress Rail Services is a wholly owned subsidiary
      of Caterpillar Inc. whose total assets and total revenues represent three
      percent and two percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial
      statement amount as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Our
      management's
      assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial
      reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
      LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. The report appears under
      - “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” of Exhibit
      13.

Changes
      in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During
      the last
      fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the company's internal
      controls over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
      likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial
      reporting.
