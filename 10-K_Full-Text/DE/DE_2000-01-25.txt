PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.

Products

Deere & Company (Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively called John Deere) have operations which are categorized into four major business segments.

The
worldwide

agricultural equipment

segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm equipment—including tractors; combine, cotton
and sugarcane harvesters; tillage, seeding and soil preparation machinery; sprayers; hay and forage equipment; materials handling equipment; and integrated precision farming technology.

The
worldwide

construction equipment

segment manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines used in construction, earthmoving and
forestry—including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; scrapers; motor graders; log skidders; and forestry harvesters.

The
worldwide

commercial and consumer equipment

segment manufactures and distributes equipment for commercial and residential uses—including
small tractors for lawn, garden, commercial and utility purposes; riding and walk-behind mowers; golf course equipment; snowblowers; handheld products such as chain saws, string trimmers and leaf
blowers; skid-steer loaders; utility vehicles; and other outdoor power products.

The
products produced by the equipment segments are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.

The

credit

segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agricultural, construction, and commercial and consumer
equipment and sales by non-Deere dealers of recreational products. In addition, it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment and finances retail revolving charge accounts.

John
Deere's worldwide agricultural, construction, and commercial and consumer equipment and special technologies operations are sometimes referred to as the "Equipment Operations."
The credit, health care and insurance operations are sometimes referred to as "Financial Services."

In
response to a recent accounting pronouncement, the Company's segments have been redefined to coincide with internal organizational structure, the way the operations are managed and
evaluated by management and materiality considerations. The manufacture and distribution of engines and drivetrain components for the original equipment manufacturer market, previously aggregated with
the construction equipment segment, are now allocated to all three major equipment segments. In addition, the operations of certain units involved in the development and marketing of special
technologies, which were previously aggregated with the agricultural equipment and the commercial and consumer equipment segments, have been aggregated and included with the health care and insurance
operations in the "Other" category, as they do not meet the materiality threshold included in the new accounting standard. The insurance operations were sold in 1999. Additional information is
presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on pages 25, 26 and 31 through 33. The John
Deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837. The present Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1958.

Market Conditions and Outlook

Agricultural Equipment.

As a result of continued weakness in farm commodity prices, industry retail sales of farm
machinery in North America are currently expected to be off by 5 to 10 percent next year. Declines of a similar nature are expected in other major markets. At the same time, farmers are in relatively
good financial condition due to higher government payments. In light of this outlook, the

Company has adopted a cautious approach, expecting sales and production volumes to trail prior-year levels early in 2000, but to be higher for the full year. The anticipated rise in sales is due to
production being increased to track more closely with retail demand than in 1999. Sales are also expected to benefit from a positive response to several important new products.

Construction Equipment.

Although higher interest rates and lower housing starts are expected to result in a moderate
slowdown in industry sales of construction equipment next year, the Company expects to have higher sales in the year 2000 due largely to an expanded product line. Company sales in the early part of
the year, however, are expected to be lower as a result of a continuation of dealer inventory adjustments. Made in conjunction with the Estimate to Cash initiative, these reductions should place the
Company in a favorable inventory position going into the following year. Industry inventory levels, however, are a source of concern with respect to price realization.

Commercial and Consumer Equipment.

Following strong gains this year, retail demand for the Company's commercial and
consumer equipment is expected to achieve further growth next year, assuming normal weather patterns and a continuation of current economic conditions. These operations are expected to benefit from
market-share growth, positive customer response to new products and continued international expansion.

Credit Operations.

Credit should continue to benefit from a larger receivable and lease portfolio next year. However,
higher growth expenditures, lower gains on the sale of retail notes and a weakened agricultural economy are expected to keep pressure on margins and bring about a sizeable reduction in overall
results.

Based
on these conditions, the Company's worldwide physical volume of sales is currently expected to increase by approximately 10 percent for the year 2000. First-quarter physical
volumes are expected to be slightly higher than in the comparable 1999 period. However, the mix of sales is expected to deteriorate and put significant downward pressure on profits for the first
quarter.

Despite
the lower 1999 results, the Company has put itself in position to benefit from an upturn in the farm economy, whenever it occurs. At the same time, the Company remains on
track with its product development plans, and numerous growth, quality, technology and Internet-related initiatives. In addition, the Company fulfilled its 1999 goal of generating strong cash flow and
is setting the stage for markedly better results once the agricultural economy starts moving ahead and as other business opportunities take shape.

1999 Consolidated Results Compared with 1998

Deere & Company net income in 1999 totaled $239 million, or $1.02 per share diluted ($1.03 basic), compared with last year's net income of $1,021
million, or $4.16 per share diluted ($4.20 basic). The
decline in profits was largely due to a continuation of weak demand for agricultural equipment caused by depressed farm commodity prices. Cash flow from operations, however, was higher due to a
reduction in agricultural equipment receivables of approximately $800 million, and a decline in construction equipment receivables of approximately $200 million. During the year, the Company
implemented aggressive production schedule reductions in order to help balance receivables and inventories with forecasted levels of demand.

Net
sales and revenues decreased 15 percent to $11,751 million in 1999 compared with $13,822 million in 1998. Net sales of the Equipment Operations decreased 19 percent in 1999 to
$9,701 million from $11,926 million last year. Overseas net sales were $2,678 million for the year, compared with $3,049 million in 1998. Overall, the Company's worldwide physical volume of sales
decreased 18 percent for the year.

The
Company's Equipment Operations, which exclude the Financial Services operations, had operating profit of $272 million in 1999 compared with $1,476 million in 1998.

Net
income of the Company's Financial Services operations improved in 1999, totaling $187 million compared with $175 million in 1998. Finance and interest income increased to $1,027
million in 1999, compared with $887 million last year. Additional information is presented in the discussion of credit operations on pages 28 and 29.

EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS

Agricultural Equipment

Sales of agricultural equipment, particularly in the United States and Canada, are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm commodity
prices, acreage planted, crop yields and government payments. Sales are also influenced by general economic conditions, farm land prices, farmers' debt levels, interest rates, agricultural trends and
the levels of costs associated with farming. Weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of equipment purchasers.

Innovations
to machinery and technology also influence buying. Reduced tillage practices have been adopted by many farmers to control soil erosion and lower production costs. John
Deere has responded to this shift by delivering leading edge planters, drills and tillage equipment. Additionally, the Company has developed a precision farming approach using advanced technology and
satellite positioning that should enable farmers to better control input costs and yields and to improve environmental management.

Large,
cost-efficient, highly-mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of total North American and Australian farm output. The large-size agricultural
equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to John Deere. A large proportion of the Equipment Operations' total agricultural equipment sales in the United States is comprised of
tractors over 100 horsepower, self-propelled combines and self-propelled cotton pickers.

Seasonal
patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the
year. Seasonal demand must be estimated in advance, and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout
the year. For certain equipment, the Company offers early order discounts to retail customers. Production schedules are based, in
part, on these early order programs. The Equipment Operations incur substantial seasonal indebtedness with related interest expense to finance production and inventory of equipment, and to finance
sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand. The Equipment Operations often encourage early retail sales decisions for both new and used equipment, by waiving retail finance charges or offering
low-rate financing, during off-season periods and in early order promotions.

An
important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse variety of short-line and specialty manufacturers with
differing manufacturing and marketing methods. Because of industry conditions, especially the merger of certain large integrated competitors, the competitive environment is undergoing significant
change.

Construction Equipment

The construction equipment industry is broadly defined as including construction, earthmoving and forestry equipment, as well as some materials handling
equipment and a variety of machines for specialized construction applications, including uses in the mining industry. The Equipment Operations provide types and sizes of equipment that compete for
approximately two-thirds of the estimated total United States market for all types and sizes of construction equipment (other than the market for cranes and specialized mining equipment). Retail sales
of John Deere construction equipment are influenced by prevailing levels of residential, industrial and public construction and the condition of the forest products industry. Sales are also influenced
by general economic conditions and the level of interest rates.

John
Deere construction equipment falls into three broad categories: smaller earthmoving equipment; medium capacity construction and earthmoving equipment; and forestry machines. The
Equipment

Operations' construction equipment business began in the late 1940s with wheel and crawler tractors of a size and horsepower range similar to agricultural tractors, utilizing common components.
Through the years, the Equipment Operations have substantially increased production capacity for construction equipment, adding to the line larger machines such as crawler loaders and dozers, log
skidders, motor graders, hydraulic excavators and four-wheel-drive loaders. During 1999, the division added articulated dump trucks, larger excavators and mini-excavators to its product line. The
division's products incorporate technology and many major components similar to those used in agricultural equipment, including diesel engines, transmissions and sophisticated hydraulics and
electronics. In addition to the construction equipment manufactured by the construction equipment division, certain products are purchased from other manufacturers for resale by John Deere.

The
Company and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Inc. of Japan ("Hitachi") have a joint venture for the manufacture of hydraulic excavators in the United States and Mexico
and for the distribution of excavators in North, Central and South America. The Company also has supply agreements with Hitachi under which a broad range of construction products manufactured by John
Deere in the United States, including four-wheel-drive loaders and small crawler dozers, are distributed by Hitachi in Japan and other Far East markets. The Company also has an agreement with Bell
Equipment of South Africa to distribute articulated dump tucks in North America.

The
division has also taken a number of initiatives in the rental equipment market for construction machinery including specially designed rental programs for Deere dealers, expanded
cooperation with major national equipment rental companies, and direct participation in the rental market, through the Company's minority ownership in Sunstate Equipment Co., LLC. After the end of the
fiscal year, the Company announced the pending acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, of the Timberjack Group,
a producer of forestry equipment headquartered in Helsinki, Finland. Additional information on the pending acquisition appears on page 42.

Commercial and Consumer Equipment

John Deere commercial and consumer equipment includes rear-engine riding mowers, front-engine lawn tractors, lawn and garden tractors, compact utility
tractors, utility tractors, skid steer loaders, front mowers, small utility vehicles, handheld products such as chain saws, string trimmers and leaf blowers, and a broad line of associated implements
for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating, and many other residential, commercial, golf and sports turf care applications. The product line also includes walk-behind mowers, snow
throwers and other outdoor power products. Retail sales of commercial and consumer equipment products are influenced by weather conditions, consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions.

The
division sells entry-level lawn, yard and garden tractors and walk-behind mowers under the name "Sabre by John Deere" in North America. The division also sells consumer products
under the Homelite and Green Machine brand names and sells walk-behind mowers in Europe under the SABO brand name and commercial mowing equipment under the Roberine brand name. The division also
builds products for sale by others. Beginning in 1999, the Company has built products under the Scott's™ brand for sale through Home Depot stores.

In
addition to the equipment manufactured by the commercial and consumer division, certain products are purchased from other manufacturers for resale by John Deere.

Engineering and Research

John Deere makes large expenditures for engineering and research to improve the quality and performance of its products, and to develop new products. Such
expenditures were $458 million, or 4.7 percent of net sales of equipment in 1999, and $444 million, or 3.7 percent in 1998.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing Plants.

In the United States and Canada, the Equipment Operations own and operate 22 factory locations,
which contain approximately 30.2 million square feet of floor space. Seven of the factories are devoted primarily to the manufacture of agricultural equipment, eight to commercial and consumer
equipment, two to construction equipment, one to engines, one to hydraulics and power train components, two to special technology equipment, and one to power train components manufactured mostly for
OEM markets. Overseas, the Equipment Operations own and operate tractor factories in Germany, Mexico and Brazil; agricultural equipment factories in France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, the Netherlands
and South Africa; engine factories in France, Mexico and Argentina; a component factory in Spain; and commercial and consumer facilities in Germany, Mexico and the Netherlands. These overseas
facilities contain approximately 8.5 million square feet of floor space. The Equipment Operations also have financial interests in other manufacturing organizations, which include agricultural
equipment manufacturers in China and the United States and a joint venture that builds construction excavators in the United States.

John
Deere's facilities are well maintained, in good operating condition and are suitable for their present purposes. These facilities, together with planned capital expenditures, are
expected to meet John Deere's manufacturing needs in the foreseeable future.

The
Equipment Operations manufacture many of the components included in their products. The principal raw materials required for the manufacture of products are purchased from
numerous suppliers. Although the Equipment Operations depend upon outside sources of supply for a substantial number of components, manufacturing operations are extensively integrated. Similar or
common manufacturing facilities and techniques are employed in the production of components for agricultural, construction, and commercial and consumer equipment.

The
physical volume of sales in 1999 was 18 percent lower than in 1998. Capacity is adequate to satisfy anticipated retail demand. The Equipment Operations' manufacturing strategy
involves the implementation of appropriate levels of technology and automation, so that manufacturing processes can remain viable at varying production levels and can be flexible enough to accommodate
many of the product design changes required to meet market requirements.

In
order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, the Equipment Operations pursue continuous improvements in manufacturing processes. These include steps
to streamline manufacturing processes and enhance customer responsiveness. The Company has implemented flexible assembly lines that can handle a wider product mix and deliver products at the times
when dealers and customers require them. Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing
technology, enhanced environmental management systems, supply management and compensation incentives related to productivity and organizational structure. The Equipment Operations also pursue the sale
to other companies of selected parts and components that can be manufactured and supplied to third parties on a competitive basis.

Capital Expenditures.

The agricultural, construction, and commercial and consumer operations' capital expenditures
totaled $291 million in 1999 compared with $425 million in 1998 and $479 million in 1997. Provisions for depreciation applicable to these operations' property, plant and equipment during these years
were $268 million, $267 million and $253 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for these operations in 2000 are currently estimated to approximate $500 million. The 2000 expenditures will be
associated with new products, operations improvement programs and the manufacture and marketing of products in new markets such as Mexico, India, China, Brazil and the former Soviet Union. Future
levels of capital expenditures will depend on business conditions.

Patents and Trademarks

John Deere owns a significant number of patents, licenses and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years. The Company believes that, in the
aggregate, the rights under these patents, licenses and trademarks are generally important to its operations, but does not consider that any patent, license, trademark or related group of them (other
than its house trademarks) is of material importance in relation to John Deere's business.

Marketing

In the United States and Canada, the Equipment Operations, excluding certain consumer product lines, distribute equipment and service parts through one
agricultural equipment sales and administration office supported by seven agricultural equipment sales branches, one construction equipment sales and administration office and one commercial and
consumer equipment sales and administration office (collectively called sales branches). In addition, the Equipment Operations operate a centralized parts distribution warehouse in coordination with
several regional parts depots in the United States and Canada and have an agreement with a third party to operate a high-volume parts warehouse in Indiana.

The
sales branches in the United States and Canada market John Deere products at approximately 3,380 dealer locations, all of which are independently owned. 1,675 sell agricultural
equipment, while 420 sell construction equipment. Smaller construction equipment is sold by nearly all of the construction equipment dealers and larger construction equipment, forestry equipment and a
line of light construction equipment are sold by most of these dealers. Commercial and consumer equipment is sold by most John Deere agricultural equipment dealers, a few construction equipment
dealers, and about 1,285 commercial and consumer equipment dealers, many of whom also handle competitive brands and dissimilar lines of products. In addition, the Sabre, Homelite, Green Machine and
Scott's™ product lines are sold through independent dealers and various general and mass merchandisers.

Outside
North America, John Deere agricultural equipment is sold to distributors and dealers for resale in over 110 countries by sales branches located in five European countries,
South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Australia, by export sales branches in Europe and the United States, and by associated companies doing business in the former Soviet Union and
China. Commercial and consumer equipment sales overseas occur primarily in Europe and Australia. Outside North America, construction equipment is sold primarily by an export sales branch located in
the United States.

Wholesale Financing

The Equipment Operations provide wholesale financing to dealers in the United States for extended periods, to enable dealers to carry representative
inventories of equipment and to encourage the purchase of goods by dealers in advance of seasonal retail demand. Down payments are not required, and interest is not charged for a substantial part of
the period for which the inventories are financed. A security interest is retained in dealers' inventories, and periodic physical checks are made of dealers' inventories. Generally, terms to dealers
require payments as the equipment which secures the indebtedness is sold to retail customers. Variable market rates of interest are charged on balances outstanding after certain interest-free periods,
which currently are one to twelve months for agricultural tractors,
one to five months for construction equipment, and two to 24 months for most other equipment. Financing is also provided to dealers on used equipment accepted in trade, on repossessed equipment, and
on approved equipment from other manufacturers. A security interest is obtained in such equipment. Dealer defaults in recent years have not been significant.

In
Canada, John Deere products (other than service parts and commercial and consumer equipment) in the possession of dealers are inventories of the Equipment Operations that are
consigned to the dealers. Dealers are required to make deposits on consigned equipment remaining unsold after specified periods.

Sales
to overseas dealers are made by the Equipment Operations' overseas and export sales branches and are, for the most part, financed by John Deere in a manner similar to that
provided for sales to dealers in the United States, although maturities tend to be shorter overseas and a security interest is not always retained in the equipment sold.

Receivables
from dealers, which largely represent dealer inventories, were $3.3 billion at October 31, 1999 compared with $4.1 billion at October 31, 1998 and $3.3
billion at October 31, 1997. At those dates, the ratios of worldwide net dealer receivables to fiscal year net sales, were 34 percent, 34 percent and 30 percent, respectively. The
highest month-end balance of such receivables during each of the past two fiscal years was $4.3 billion at April 30, 1999 and $4.4 billion at April 30, 1998. Wholesale financing is also
provided by the Company's credit segment. See "Financial Services—Credit Operations" below.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

Credit Operations

United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France and the United Kingdom.

The Company's credit
subsidiaries provide and administer financing for retail purchases of new and used John Deere agricultural, construction, and commercial and consumer equipment. The credit operations also provide
wholesale financing for wholesale inventories of John Deere agricultural and John Deere construction equipment owned by dealers of those products. The Company's credit subsidiaries include John Deere
Credit Company, John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) and its subsidiaries (Deere Credit, Inc., Farm Plan Corporation, Deere Credit Services, Inc., John Deere Receivables, Inc.,
John Deere Funding Corporation, Senstar Capital Corporation, Arrendadora John Deere, S.A. de C.V., John Deere Credit Group, Plc and John Deere Credit Limited—United Kingdom, and John Deere
Credit Limited— Australia, among others), and John Deere Credit Inc. (Canada) (collectively referred to as the Credit Companies). Deere & Company and John Deere Construction
Equipment Company are referred to as the "sales companies." The Capital Corporation purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. These retail notes
are acquired by the sales companies through John Deere retail dealers in the United States and Mexico. John Deere Credit Inc. purchases and finances retail notes acquired by John Deere's equipment
sales branches in Canada. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the Credit Companies acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with the sales companies.
During the year, the Credit Companies also purchased and financed retail notes unrelated to John Deere, representing primarily recreational product notes acquired from independent dealers of
recreational vehicles. The Credit Companies also finance and service revolving charge accounts through merchants or leading farm input providers in the agricultural, construction, and lawn and grounds
care retail markets and, additionally, provide
wholesale financing for wholesale inventories of recreational vehicles, manufactured housing units, yachts and John Deere engines.

Retail
notes acquired by the sales companies have been immediately sold to the Credit Companies. The Equipment Operations have been the Credit Companies' major source of business, but
in some cases, retail purchasers of John Deere products finance their purchases outside the John Deere organization.

The
Credit Companies' terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items purchased through unsecured revolving charge accounts) provide for retention of a security
interest in the equipment financed. The Credit Companies' guidelines for minimum down payments, which vary with the types of equipment and repayment provisions, are generally not less than 20 percent
on agricultural and construction equipment, 10 percent on lawn and grounds care equipment used for personal use, and 10 percent for recreational vehicles. Finance charges are sometimes waived for
specified periods or reduced on certain John Deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions. The Credit Companies generally receive compensation from the
Equipment Operations equal to a competitive interest rate for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases. The cost is accounted for as a deduction in
arriving at net sales by the Equipment Operations.

Retail
leases are offered to equipment users in the United States, Mexico, France, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. A small number of leases are executed with units of
local government. Leases are usually written for periods of one to six years, and frequently contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail
leases are also offered in a generally similar manner to customers in Canada through John Deere Credit Inc. and the Company's Canadian subsidiary, John Deere Limited.

The
Company has an agreement with the Capital Corporation to make income maintenance payments to the Capital Corporation such that its ratio of earnings before fixed charges to fixed
charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. For 1999 and 1998, the Capital Corporation's ratios were 1.64 to 1 and 1.63 to 1, respectively. The Company has also committed to own at
least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of the Capital Corporation and to maintain the Capital Corporation's consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. These
arrangements are not intended to make the Company responsible for the payment of any indebtedness, obligation or liability of the Capital Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. No
payments were necessary under this agreement in 1998 or 1999. Additional information on the Credit Companies appears under the caption "Credit Operations" on pages 28 and 29.

Overseas.

John Deere Credit Limited (United Kingdom) offers equipment financing products within the United Kingdom.
Arrendadora John Deere, S.A. de C.V. offers equipment financing products within Mexico. John Deere Credit-Germany, a partnership, offers equipment financing within Germany. John Deere Credit Limited
(Australia) offers equipment financing products within Australia and New Zealand. John Deere Credit S.A.S., a joint venture, offers equipment financing in France. Banco John Deere (Brazil) offers
equipment financing products within Brazil. Retail sales financing outside of the United States and Canada is affected by a diversity of customs and regulations.

Health Care

In 1985, the Company formed John Deere Health Care, Inc. to commercialize the Company's expertise in the field of health care, which had been developed
from efforts to control its own health care costs. John Deere Health Care currently provides health management programs and related administrative
services, through its health maintenance organization subsidiaries, John Deere Family Healthplan, Inc. and John Deere Health Plan, Inc., for companies located in Illinois, Iowa, South Carolina,
Tennessee and Virginia. At October 31, 1999, approximately 414,000 individuals were enrolled in these programs, of which approximately 70,800 were John Deere employees, retirees and their
dependents. During the fiscal year, John Deere Health Care dissolved its subsidiary, John Deere Healthplan of Georgia, Inc., and exited the Georgia market for commercial insured business. In
addition, John Deere Health Care's subsidiary, Heritage National Healthplan, Inc., changed its name to John Deere Health Plan, Inc. In December 1999, John Deere Health Care's
other subsidiary, John Deere Family Healthplan, Inc., was merged into John Deere Health Plan, Inc., effectively creating one health maintenance subsidiary.

Insurance

The Company's insurance subsidiaries, consisting of John Deere Insurance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, were sold during 1999. The insurance group marketed
commercial property/casualty insurance coverages and services to selected market segments, including agricultural equipment, construction equipment and automobile dealerships, trucking operations, and
specialty insurance.

Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to a wide variety of state, federal and international environmental laws, rules and regulations. These laws, rules and
regulations may affect the way the Company conducts its operations and failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties. The

Company is also involved in the evaluation and clean-up of a limited number of sites currently owned and the evaluation of a limited number of sites that may be acquired in pending acquisitions,
including the pending acquisition of the Timberjack Group. Additional information on the pending acquisition appears on page 42. Management does not expect that these matters will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.

Employees

At October 31, 1999, John Deere had approximately 38,700 full-time employees, including approximately 25,900 employees in the United States and Canada.
From time to time, John Deere also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 45 percent of John
Deere's United States employees. Most of the Company's United States production and maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW), with an
expiration date of September 30, 2003.

The
majority of employees at John Deere facilities in Canada and overseas are also represented by unions.

Company administrative offices, research facilities and certain facilities for health care activities, all of which are owned by John Deere, together contain about 2.1
million square feet of floor space and miscellaneous other facilities total 0.5 million square feet. John Deere also leases space in various locations totaling about 2.9 million square feet.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product
liability, retail credit, software licensing, patent and

trademark matters. On August 13, 1999 the Federal District Court in Chicago granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of the Company in a lawsuit entitled

Caterpillar Inc. v. Deere & Company

in which Caterpillar had charged Deere & Company with infringement of a patent on rubber tracked
tractors. In granting the motion for summary judgment filed by Deere & Company, the District Court Judge determined there was no infringement. Caterpillar has appealed the case. Although it is
not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, the Company believes these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect
on its financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

See the information under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on pages 25 through 30.

Year 2000 Status Update

No public infrastructure problems or any facilities related problems were encountered by John Deere locations during the rollover to the year 2000. After
extensive system verification and testing the Company's systems are operating normally. The Company is not aware of any significant issues related to the Year 2000 problem.

John
Deere manufactured products do not contain microprocessors with date-related functions so therefore are unaffected by Year 2000 rollover concerns.

The
Company continues to monitor the status of our operations, suppliers and distribution channels to ensure no significant business interruptions.

The
Company took a multi-faceted approach to minimize business interruption arising from the rollover to the Year 2000 and approached Year 2000 readiness as an enterprise-wide
project. The Company's Year 2000 Program addressed the eight major assessment areas identified by Automotive Industry Action Group. These areas include business information systems, mainframe and
personal computers, the distributed network and purchased software, the shop floor, facilities systems, the Company's products and product research and development facilities, and the readiness of the
Company's suppliers and distribution network.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

The Company is exposed to a variety of market risks, including interest rates and currency exchange rates. The Company attempts to actively manage these risks.
See the information under "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on page 30, the "Financial Instruments" note on page 41 and the supplementary data under "Financial Instrument Risk

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSIONAND ANALYSIS (Unaudited)

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997

Deere & Company and its subsidiaries manufacture, distribute and finance a full line of agricultural equipment; a broad range of equipment for
construction and forestry; a variety of commercial and consumer equipment; and other technological products and services. The company also provides credit services and managed health care plans.
Additional information on these business segments is presented beginning on page 31.

1999 COMPARED WITH 1998

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Net income in 1999 totaled $239 million, or $1.02 per share diluted ($1.03 basic), compared with $1,021 million, or $4.16 per share diluted
($4.20 basic), in 1998. The decline in profits was largely due to a continuation of weak demand for agricultural equipment caused by depressed farm commodity prices. Cash flow from operations,
however, was higher due to a reduction in agricultural equipment receivables of approximately $800 million, and a decline in construction equipment receivables of approximately
$200 million. During the year, the company implemented aggressive production schedule reductions in order to help balance receivables and inventories with forecasted levels of demand.

Net
sales and revenues decreased 15 percent to $11,751 million in 1999, compared with $13,822 million in 1998. Net sales of the Equipment Operations decreased
19 percent in 1999 to $9,701 million from $11,926 million last year. Overseas net sales were $2,678 million for the year, compared with $3,049 million in 1998.
Overall, the company's worldwide physical volume of sales decreased 18 percent for the year.

The
company's Equipment Operations, which exclude the Financial Services operations, had operating profit of $272 million in 1999, compared with $1,476 million in 1998.
Lower sales and production volumes of agricultural and construction equipment, an adverse sales mix and the cost of early-retirement programs affected the 1999 results. Largely due to the reduction in
agricultural and construction trade receivables, equipment operations' assets ended the year at $8,702 million, 4 percent below the previous year.

Net
income of the company's Financial Services operations improved in 1999 totaling $187 million, compared with $175 million in 1998. Finance and interest income
increased to $1,027 million in 1999, compared with $887 million last year. Additional information for the credit operations is presented on pages 28 and 29.

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS

In 1999, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Consequently, the operating
segments have been redefined to coincide with internal management reporting and previously reported operating results have been restated. The following discussion of operating results by reportable
segment and geographic area relates to information beginning on page 31. Operating profit is income before interest expense, foreign exchange gains and
losses, income taxes and corporate expenses. However, operating profit of the credit segment includes the effect of interest expense.

The agricultural equipment segment incurred an operating loss of $51 million in 1999, compared with an operating profit of $941 million in 1998. Lower sales and production volumes,
especially of high-horsepower, high-margin agricultural equipment, were primary reasons for the loss as sales decreased 31 percent in 1999, compared with 1998. Lower
production volumes, however, have helped achieve a substantial reduction in trade receivables and improved cash flow. Results were also affected by the $68 million pretax cost of
early-retirement programs and higher sales incentive costs, with an emphasis on used goods. Overseas operations, which experienced a more moderate decline in sales than in North America, continued to
be positive contributors to the segment's results. These operations, as well, are benefitting from increased market shares and strong response to innovative products.

The construction equipment segment had an operating profit of $149 million in 1999, compared to $326 million in 1998. Sales decreased 18 percent in 1999, compared to last year.
During the early part of 1999, the segment began implementation of its Estimate to Cash order-fulfillment initiative, which is aimed at better matching product availability with customer requirements,
while reducing field inventories. Although retail sales remained at favorable levels, company sales and production volumes declined as dealers reduced field inventories largely due to this initiative.
The reduction, however, also reflects a weaker business outlook. In addition, the 1999 results were affected by higher sales incentive costs.

The
company's other operations had an aggregate operating loss of $33 million for the year, compared with an operating profit of $11 million in 1998. These results
reflected start-up costs and goodwill amortization at the newly formed John Deere Special Technologies Group, which encompasses communications, electronics, software and Internet-related
products and services. Additionally, losses were incurred in the insurance subsidiaries, which were sold during the year. Partly offsetting these factors were higher earnings from the company's health
care operations.

The
overseas equipment operations had an operating profit of $224 million in 1999, compared with $299 million last year, primarily due to lower sales and production
volumes. As previously mentioned, the decline in overseas sales has been more moderate than in North America. In addition, these
operations benefited from increased market shares and strong customer reception to innovative products. Overseas sales were 12 percent lower than last year, while the physical volume of sales
decreased 13 percent in 1999, compared with 1998.

MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK

Agricultural Equipment

As a result of continued weakness in farm commodity prices, industry retail sales of farm machinery in North America are currently expected to be off by 5 to
10 percent next year. Declines of a similar nature are expected in other major markets. At the same time, farmers are in relatively good financial condition due to higher government payments.
In light of this outlook, the company has adopted a cautious approach, expecting sales and production volumes to trail prior-year levels early in 2000, but to be higher for the full year.
The anticipated rise in sales is due to production being increased to track more closely with retail demand than in 1999. Sales are also expected to benefit from a positive response to several
important new products.

Construction Equipment

Although higher interest rates are expected to result in a moderate slowdown in industry sales next year, the company expects to have higher sales in the year
2000 due largely to an expanded product line. Company sales in the early part of the year, however, are expected to be lower as a result of a continuation of dealer inventory adjustments. Made in
conjunction with the Estimate to Cash initiative, these reductions place the company in a favorable inventory position going into the following year. Industry inventory levels, however, are a source
of concern with respect to price realization.

Commercial and Consumer Equipment

Following strong gains this year, retail demand for the company's commercial and consumer equipment is expected to achieve further growth next year, assuming
normal weather patterns and a continuation of current economic conditions. These operations are expected to benefit from market-share growth, positive customer response to new products and continued
international expansion.

Credit Operations

Credit should continue to benefit from a larger receivable and lease portfolio next year. However, higher growth expenditures, lower gains on the sale of
retail notes and a weakened agricultural economy are expected to keep pressure on margins and bring about a sizeable reduction in overall results.

Based
on these conditions, the company's worldwide physical volume of sales is currently expected to increase by approximately 10 percent for the year 2000. First-quarter
physical volumes are expected to be slightly higher than in the comparable 1999 period. However, the mix of sales is expected to deteriorate and put significant downward pressure on profits for the
quarter.

Despite
the lower 1999 results, the company has put itself in position to benefit from an upturn in the farm economy, whenever it occurs. At the same time, the company remains on
track with its product development plans, and numerous growth, quality, technology and Internet-related initiatives. In addition, the company fulfilled its 1999 goal of generating strong cash flow and
is setting the stage for
markedly better results once the agricultural economy starts moving ahead and as other business opportunities take shape.

YEAR 2000

The company established a global program (the "Year 2000 Program") to address the inability of certain computer and infrastructure systems to process dates in
the Year 2000 and later. The major assessment areas included information systems, mainframe and personal computers, software, the distributed network, the shop floor, facilities systems, the company's
products, product research and development facilities, and the readiness of the company's suppliers and distribution network.

All
of the company's systems identified as being mission critical have been tested and verified as being Year 2000 ready. The company also assessed the Year 2000 readiness of its
product suppliers and dealers and developed contingency plans for its mission critical suppliers. Although there could be some inconveniences, the company believes the dealers will be able to service
their customers without any significant disruptions. The total cost of the modifications and upgrades including internal costs has been approximately $43 million pretax since the beginning of
1997. The future costs to complete the Year 2000 Program are expected to be approximately $4 million. These costs are expensed as incurred and do not include the cost of software replaced in
the ordinary course of business. Other major systems projects have not been deferred due to the Year 2000 compliance projects.

Although
no assurances can be given as to the company's readiness at the time of this report, particularly as it relates to third-parties, based upon the progress to date, the company
does not expect the consequences of any of the company's unanticipated or unsuccessful modifications to have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. However, the
failure to correct a material Year 2000 problem could result in lost sales or profits. The company believes that its "most reasonably likely worst case scenario" may involve the Year 2000
noncompliance of a critical third party causing that third party to fail to deliver, with the result that production is interrupted at one or more facilities. The company believes this risk is greater
outside North America and Europe. The company has developed contingency plans in all of the assessment areas noted above that it believes will mitigate the impact of any interruptions related to the
Year 2000.

EURO CONVERSION

The company is well advanced in the process of identification, implementation and testing of its systems to adopt the euro currency in its operations. The
transition period for this change is January 1, 1999 through January 1, 2002. The company's affected suppliers, distribution network and financial institutions have been contacted and to
date the currency change has not had a significant impact on these relationships. The cost of information systems modifications, effects on product pricing and purchase

contracts, and the impact on foreign currency financial instruments, including derivatives, are not expected to be material.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:

Statements under the "Market
Conditions and Outlook", "Year 2000" and "Euro Conversion" headings, the "Supplemental Information (Unaudited)" on pages 42 and 43 and other statements herein that relate to future operating periods
are subject to important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Forward-looking statements relating to the company's businesses involve certain factors that
are subject to change, including: the many interrelated factors that affect farmers' confidence, including worldwide demand for agricultural products, world grain stocks, commodities prices, weather
conditions, real estate values, animal diseases, crop pests, harvest yields, and government farm programs; general economic conditions and housing starts; legislation, primarily legislation relating
to agriculture, the environment, commerce and government spending on infrastructure; actions of competitors in the various industries in which the company competes; levels of new and used field
inventories, production difficulties, including capacity and supply constraints; dealer practices; labor relations; interest and currency exchange rates (including conversion to the euro);
technological difficulties (including Year 2000 readiness); accounting standards; and other risks and uncertainties. Economic difficulties in various parts of the world could continue to adversely
affect North American grain and meat exports. The number of housing starts is especially important to sales of construction equipment. Sales of commercial and consumer equipment during the winter are
affected by the amount and timing of snowfall. The company's outlook is based upon assumptions relating to the factors described above, which are sometimes based upon estimates and data prepared by
government agencies. Such estimates and data are often revised. Further information, including factors that potentially could materially affect the company's financial results, is included in the
company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

1998 COMPARED WITH 1997

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Deere & Company achieved record net income in 1998, totaling $1,021 million, or $4.16 per share diluted ($4.20 basic), compared with income of
$960 million, or $3.74 per share diluted ($3.78 basic) in 1997. The Equipment Operations and the Financial Services operations both contributed to the higher level of earnings.

Net
sales and revenues increased 8 percent to a record $13,822 million in 1998, compared with $12,791 million in 1997. Net sales of the Equipment Operations
increased 8 percent in 1998 to $11,926 million from $11,082 million in 1997. Export sales from the United States totaled $1,970 million for 1998, compared with
$2,013 million in 1997. Overseas sales, which were affected by weaker economic conditions and adverse currency fluctuations, were slightly lower in 1998. Overall, the company's worldwide
physical volume of sales increased 8 percent in 1998.

The
company's Equipment Operations, which exclude income from the Financial Services operations and unconsolidated affiliates, had income of $831 million in 1998, compared with
$817 million in 1997. The strong performances of the commercial and consumer equipment and construction equipment operations led to the record results. Overall, the improvement was due to
higher sales and production volumes, partially offset by higher sales incentive costs, growth expenditures, interest expense and unfavorable currency fluctuations. Operating profit of the Equipment
Operations represented 12.4 percent of net sales in 1998, compared to 12.6 percent in 1997.

Net
income of the company's Financial Services operations improved in 1998 totaling $175 million, compared with $138 million in 1997. Finance and interest income
increased to $887 million in 1998,

compared with $758 million in 1997. Additional information for the credit operations is presented on pages 28 through 29.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

Operating profit of the agricultural equipment segment decreased to $941 million in 1998, compared with $1,048 million in 1997, as a result of
higher sales incentive costs, an unfavorable sales mix and inefficiencies associated with production cuts, partially offset by an increase in sales. Agricultural equipment sales increased
2 percent in 1998, compared with 1997. However, during the fourth quarter of 1998, sales of agricultural equipment decreased 18 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 1997, as lower
farm commodity prices and weaker farm economic conditions adversely affected retail demand. As a result, the company reduced production of large tractors and combines in order to keep inventories in
balance.

The
construction equipment operations generated a significantly higher operating profit of $326 million in 1998, compared to $245 million in 1997. The increased
operating profit in 1998 reflected higher sales and production volumes, lower operating expenses and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher sales incentive costs and production
start-up expenses at the engine facility in Torreon, Mexico. In 1998, construction equipment sales increased 14 percent, compared with 1997.

The
commercial and consumer equipment segment's operating profit increased significantly to $213 million in 1998, compared with $115 million in 1997, as a result of
higher sales and production volumes driven by strong retail demand for the company's products, as well as improved operating efficiencies. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher expenses for
the promotion of new products and the start-up of new facilities. The results in 1997 were adversely affected by write-offs related to the Homelite product line. Commercial and
consumer equipment sales increased 22 percent in 1998, compared with 1997.

The
operating profit of the credit operations improved to $256 million in 1998, compared with $232 million in 1997. The credit operations are discussed on pages 28 and
29.

CREDIT OPERATIONS

The credit operations primarily finance sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agricultural, construction and commercial and consumer
equipment, and sales by non-Deere dealers of recreational products. In addition, these operations provide wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment and finance retail
revolving charge accounts.

Acquisition
volumes of financing receivables and leases increased 8 percent in 1999, compared with 1998. The volumes of revolving charge accounts, wholesale notes, leases and
retail notes increased 13 percent, 11 percent, 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, driven primarily by the growth in construction equipment leasing and retail notes and
agricultural revolving charge accounts. The credit operations also

sold retail notes receiving proceeds of $2,482 million during 1999, compared with $1,860 million last year. At October 31, 1999 and 1998, net financing receivables and leases
administered, which include receivables previously sold but still administered, were $10,992 million and $9,625 million, respectively. The discussion of "Financing Receivables" on pages
36 and 37 presents additional information.

Net
income of the credit operations was $175 million in 1999, compared with $163 million in 1998 and $147 million in 1997. Net income in 1999 was higher than in
1998 due primarily to higher earnings from a larger average receivable and lease portfolio, a reduction in leverage and a gain on the sale of the yacht retail note portfolio and related intangibles,
partially offset by higher receivable write-offs, lower financing spreads and higher operating expenses. Total revenues of the credit operations increased in 1999, reflecting the larger
average portfolio, compared with 1998. The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 6 percent higher in 1999, compared with 1998. Higher average borrowings in 1999 resulted in a
small increase in interest expense, compared with 1998.

Net
income in 1998 was higher than in 1997 due primarily to higher earnings from a larger average receivable and lease portfolio and higher gains from the sales of retail notes,
partially offset by higher operating expenses. Total revenues of the credit operations increased 19 percent in 1998, reflecting the larger average portfolio, compared with 1997. The average
balance of receivables and leases financed was 13 percent higher in 1998, compared with 1997. Higher average borrowings in 1998 resulted in a 16 percent increase in interest expense,
compared with 1997.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The discussion of capital resources and liquidity has been organized to review separately, where appropriate, the company's Equipment Operations, Financial
Services operations and the consolidated totals.

EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS

The company's equipment businesses are capital intensive and are subject to large seasonal variations in financing requirements for receivables from dealers
and inventories. Accordingly, to the extent necessary, funds provided by operations are supplemented from external borrowing sources.

Cash
provided by operating activities during 1999 was $1,075 million, primarily resulting from the significant decrease in trade receivables and from net income. The operating
cash flows and proceeds from

the sale of a business of $179 million were used primarily to fund a decrease in borrowings of $481 million, purchases of property and equipment of $304 million, the payment of
dividends to stockholders of $205 million, acquisitions of businesses for $152 million and an increase in cash and cash equivalents.

Over
the last three years, operating activities have provided an aggre gate of $2,193 million in cash. In addition, borrowings increased $733 million and cash and cash
equivalents decreased $396 million. The aggregate amount of these cash flows was used mainly to fund repurchases of common stock of $1,354 million, purchases of property and equipment of
$1,200 million, stockholders' dividends of $622 million and acquisitions of businesses for $285 million.

Trade
accounts and notes receivable result mainly from sales to dealers of equipment that is being carried in their inventories. Trade receivables decreased by $808 million
during 1999. North American agricultural equipment trade receivables decreased $753 million and construction equipment receivables decreased $206 million, while commercial and consumer
equipment receivables increased $182 million and other equipment receivables increased $12 million. Total overseas equipment receivables were $43 million lower than one year ago.
Agricultural equipment receivables decreased significantly in 1999 due to the aggressive production schedule reductions implemented by the company in order to help balance the levels of receivables
with forecasted demand. Construction equipment receivables declined due to the Estimate to Cash order-fulfillment initiative. Commercial and consumer equipment receivables are higher than a year ago
to support increased retail sales. The ratios of worldwide trade accounts and notes receivable at October 31 to fiscal year net sales were 34 percent in 1999, compared with
34 percent in 1998 and 30 percent in 1997. Although receivables decreased significantly in 1999, the ratio was also affected by the decrease in net sales.

The
collection period for trade receivables averages less than 12 months. The percentage of receivables outstanding for a period exceeding 12 months was
12 percent at October 31, 1999, compared with 8 percent at October 31, 1998 and 5 percent at October 31, 1997.

Company-owned
inventories were approximately the same in 1999 as in 1998.

Total
interest-bearing debt of the Equipment Operations was $1,678 million at the end of 1999, compared with $2,065 million at the end of 1998 and $711 million at
the end of 1997. The ratio of total debt to total capital (total interest-bearing debt and stockholders' equity) at the end of 1999, 1998 and 1997 was 29.1 percent, 33.6 percent and
14.6 percent, respectively.

During
1999, Deere & Company issued $250 million of 6.55% notes due in 2004 and $250 million of medium-term notes.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

The Financial Services' credit operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Their
primary sources of funds for this purpose are a combination of borrowings and equity capital. Additionally, the credit operations periodically sell substantial amounts of retail notes.

Cash
flows from the company's Financial Services operating activities were $435 million in 1999. The cash provided by operating activities was used primarily to increase total
receivables and leases. Cash used for investing activities totaled $364 million in 1999, primarily due to acquisitions of receivables and leases exceeding collections by $2,972 million,
which was partially offset by proceeds of $2,482 million from the sale of receivables and $191 million from the sale of equipment on operating leases. Acquisitions of businesses also
totaled $64 million in the current year. Cash used for financing activities totaled $128 million in 1999, representing mainly a decrease in total borrowings of $53 million and
$75 million of dividends paid to the Equipment Operations.

Over
the past three years, the Financial Services operating activities have provided $1,084 million in cash. In addition, the sale of receivables and an increase in borrowings
have provided $5,309 million and $908 million, respectively. These amounts have been used mainly to fund receivable and lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections by
$7,362 million.

Marketable
securities held by Financial Services decreased $757 million during 1999 primarily due to the sale of the insurance subsidiaries and the transfer of securities to
Deere & Company before the sale. The remaining portfolio consists of the securities held by the Financial Services' health care subsidiaries and those transferred to Deere & Company.
Additional information is presented on pages 35 and 36.

Financing
receivables and leases increased by $1,039 million in 1999, compared with 1998. The discussion of "Credit Operations" on pages 28 and 29 provides further information.

Total
outside interest-bearing debt of the credit operations was $6,616 million at the end of 1999, compared with $6,049 million at the end of 1998 and
$5,686 million at the end of 1997. The credit subsidiaries' ratio of total interest-bearing debt to total stockholder's equity was 6.0 to 1 at the end of 1999, compared with 6.1 to 1 at the end
of 1998 and 6.6 to 1 at the end of 1997.

During
1999, the credit operations issued $300 million of 6% notes due in 2009 and $300 million of 7% notes due in 2002. These operations also retired
$150 million of 9


/


% subordinated notes, $97 million of 5% Swiss franc bonds, $200 million of 6% notes, $200 million of 6.3% notes and $99 million of
other miscellaneous notes all due in 1999. The credit operations also issued $1,804 million and retired $1,031 million of medium-term notes in 1999.

CONSOLIDATED

The company maintains unsecured lines of credit with various United States and foreign banks. The discussion of "Short-Term Borrowings" on page 38
provides further information.

The
company is naturally exposed to various interest rate and foreign currency risks. As a result, the company enters into derivative transactions to hedge certain of these exposures
that arise in the normal course of business, and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. Similar to other large credit companies, the company's credit operations actively
manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate fluctuations, while responding to
favorable financing opportunities. Accordingly, from time to time, these operations enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge their interest rate exposure. The company also has foreign
currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies. The company has entered into agreements
related to the management of these currency transaction risks. The credit and market risks under these interest rate and foreign currency agreements are not considered to be significant. Additional
detailed financial instrument information is included on pages 41 through 43.

Stockholders'
equity was $4,094 million at October 31, 1999, compared with $4,080 million and $4,147 million at October 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The increase in 1999 was caused primarily by net income of $239 million, partially offset by cash dividends declared of $204 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of all companies in which Deere & Company has a majority ownership. Deere &
Company records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (20 to 50 percent ownership) at its related equity in the net assets of such affiliate. Other investments (less than
20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost. Consolidated retained earnings at October 31, 1999 include undistributed earnings of the unconsolidated affiliates of $58 million.
Dividends from unconsolidated affiliates were $6 million in 1999, $6 million in 1998 and $4 million in 1997.

The
company's consolidated financial statements and some information in the notes and related commentary are presented in a format which includes data grouped as follows:

Equipment Operations—

These data include the company's agricultural equipment, construction equipment, commercial and
consumer equipment and special technologies operations with Financial Services reflected on the equity basis. Data relating to the above equipment operations, including the consolidated group data in
the income statement, are also referred to as "Equipment Operations" in this report.

Financial Services—

These data include the company's credit, insurance and health care operations The insurance operations
were sold in the fourth quarter of 1999.

Consolidated—

These data represent the consolidation of the Equipment Operations and Financial Services in conformity with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 94. References to "Deere & Company" or "the company" refer to the entire enterprise.

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Sales
of equipment and service parts are generally recorded by the company when they are shipped to independent dealers. Provisions for sales incentives and product warranty costs are
recognized at the time of sale or at the inception of the incentive programs and are based on certain estimates the company believes are appropriate.

In
1999, the company adopted FASBStatements No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and
No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. See information beginning on pages 24, 31, and 33, respectively. These Statements had no effect on the
company's financial position or net income. In 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Under the new standard, all derivatives
will be recorded at fair value in the financial statements. The company will adopt this statement in fiscal year 2001. The effect on the company's financial position or net income is not expected to
be material. In 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. This SOP requires the
capitalization of costs for software developed for internal use, which were previously expensed. The SOP will be adopted in fiscal year 2000 and the effect on the company's financial position or net
income is not expected to be material.

In
1999, the company completed the following acquisitions and dispositions. The company purchased the remaining 60 percent interest in SLC-John Deere, a Brazilian
farm equipment manufacturer of combines, tractors and planters. The acquisition cost was $174 million, including $42 million of goodwill, which will be amortized over 20 years.
The company purchased the remaining 50 percent interest in InterAg Technologies, Inc., a developer of electronic controls and agribusiness software, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia for
$55 million. The acquisition cost included 1.5 million shares of Deere & Company

common stock valued at $49 million with the remainder in cash. The company purchased a 32 percent interest in Bell Equipment Company, a manufacturer of articulated dump trucks, located
in Richards Bay, South Africa for $29 million. The company's subsidiary, John Deere Capital Corporation, purchased Senstar Capital Corporation, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for
$41 million and the remaining 50 percent interest in John Deere Credit Limited located in Gloucester, England for $18 million. The company sold John Deere Insurance
Group, Inc. (JDIG), which provides certain lines of property and casualty coverages. JDIG had a net loss of $.4 million in the first eleven months of 1999 compared with net income of
$8.9 million and $29.6 million during the years 1998 and 1997, respectively. The gain on the sale was immaterial. Neither the acquisitions nor the sale had a material effect on the
company's financial position or results of operations.

Certain
amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with 1999 financial statement presentations.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997

In 1999, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Consequently, the segments
have been redefined to coincide with internal organizational structure, the way the operations are managed and evaluated by management and materiality considerations. The manufacture and distribution
of engines and drivetrain components for the original equipment manufacturer market, previously aggregated with the construction equipment segment, are now allocated to all three major equipment
segments. In addition, the operations of certain units involved in the development and marketing of special technologies, which were previously aggregated with the agricultural equipment and the
commercial and consumer equipment segments, have been aggregated and included with the health care and insurance operations in the "Other" category, as they do not meet the materiality threshold of
FASB Statement No. 131. The insurance operations were sold in 1999. Prior periods have been restated for the adoption of the Statement. The company's operations are now organized and reported
in four major business segments described as follows.

The
company's worldwide agricultural equipment segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm equipment—including tractors; combine, cotton and sugarcane
harvesters; tillage, seeding and soil preparation machinery; sprayers; hay and forage equipment; materials handling equipment; and integrated precision farming technology.

The
company's worldwide construction equipment segment manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines used in construction, earthmoving and forestry—including
backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; scrapers; motor graders; log skidders and forestry harvesters.

The
company's worldwide commercial and consumer equipment segment manufactures and distributes equipment for commercial and residential uses—including small tractors for
lawn, garden, commercial and utility purposes; riding and walk-behind mowers; golf course equipment; snowblowers; handheld
products such as chain saws, string trimmers and leaf blowers; skid-steer loaders; utility vehicles; and other outdoor power products.

The
products produced by the equipment segments are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.

The
company's credit segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agricultural, construction and commercial and consumer equipment and sales by
non-Deere dealers of recreational products. In addition, it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment and finances retail revolving charge accounts.

Corporate
assets are primarily the Equipment Operations' prepaid pension costs, deferred income tax assets, other receivables and cash and short-term investments as
disclosed in the financial statements, net of certain minor intercompany eliminations.

Because
of integrated manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing support, a substantial number of allocations must be made to determine operating segment and
geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues represent sales of components and finance charges which are generally based on market prices. Overseas operations are defined to include all
activities of divisions, subsidiaries and affiliated companies conducted outside the United States and Canada.

Information
relating to operations by operating segment in millions of dollars follows with related comments included in Management's Discussion and Analysis. In addition to the
following unaffiliated sales and revenues by segment, intersegment sales and revenues in 1999, 1998, and 1997 were as follows: agricultural equipment net sales of $106 million,
$132 million and $103 million and credit revenues of $1 million, $2 million and $2 million, respectively.

The company views and has historically disclosed its operations as consisting of two geographic areas, the United States and Canada, and overseas, shown below in millions of dollars.
Operating income for these areas has been disclosed in addition to the requirements under FASB Statement No. 131. No individual foreign country's net sales and revenues were material for
disclosure purposes. The percentages shown in the captions for net sales and revenues indicate the approximate proportion of each amount that relates to the United States only. The percentages are
based upon a three-year average for 1999, 1998 and 1997.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
    The following disclosure has been revised in 1999 for the adoption of FASB Statement No. 132, Employers' Disclosures About Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits. The company has several defined benefit pension plans covering its United States employees and employees in certain foreign countries. The company also has several defined
benefit health care and life insurance plans for retired employees in the United States and Canada.

In addition to the special termination benefits included in the pension and postretirement benefit plans shown above, the company provided $34 million of other special
early-retirement benefits to certain employees in 1999. These benefits and the special termination benefits included in the benefit plans totaled $68 million in 1999.
    The annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (the health care cost trend rates) used to determine 1999, 1998 and 1997 costs were assumed to be
6.0 percent for 2000, decreasing gradually to 4.5 percent by the year 2003, 9.1 percent for 1999, decreasing gradually to 4.5 percent by the year 2003 and
9.0 percent for 1998, decreasing gradually to 4.5 percent by the year 2003, respectively. An increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at October 31, 1999 by $269 million and the net periodic postretirement benefits cost for that year by $35 million. A decrease
of one percentage point

would decrease the postretirement benefit obligations by $241 million and the cost by $31 million for the same period.

Based
upon location of the company's operations, the consolidated income before income taxes in the United States in 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $21 million, $1,158 million
and $1,057 million, respectively, and in foreign countries was $344 million, $402 million and $450 million, respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches of
Deere & Company and are, therefore, subject to United States as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision by
taxing jurisdiction are, therefore, not directly related.

A
comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision and reasons for related differences in millions of dollars follows:

At
October 31, 1999, accumulated earnings in certain overseas subsidiaries totaled $797 million for which no provision for United States income taxes or foreign
withholding taxes has been made, because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested overseas indefinitely. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these
unremitted earnings is not practical.

Deere &
Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes the wholly-owned Financial Services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account
for income taxes generally as if they filed separate income tax returns.

At
October 31, 1999, certain foreign tax loss and tax credit carryforwards for $12 million were available with an unlimited expiration date.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

Marketable securities are held by Deere & Company and its health care subsidiaries. The securities held by Deere & Company at October 31,
1999 are those transferred from John Deere Insurance Group, Inc. (JDIG) prior to the sale of the subsidiary (see page 31). All marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale under FASB Statement No. 115, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains or losses from the sales
of marketable securities are based on the specific identification method.

available-for-sale securities were $19 million in 1999, $105 million in 1998 and $114 million in 1997. Gross realized gains and losses on those sales were
not significant. In addition, $502 million of marketable securities were included in the sale of JDIG in 1999. The increase (decrease) in the net unrealized holding gain after income taxes was
$(19) million, $3 million and $8 million during 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

At October 31, 1999 and 1998, dealer notes included above were $856 million and $955 million, respectively.

Trade
accounts and notes receivable arise from sales to dealers of John Deere agricultural, construction and commercial and consumer equipment. The company generally retains as
collateral a security interest in the equipment associated with these receivables. Generally, terms to dealers require payments as the equipment which secures the indebtedness is sold to retail
customers. Interest is charged on balances outstanding after certain interest-free periods, which range from one to 12 months for agricultural tractors, one to five months for
construction equipment, and from two to 24 months for most other equipment. Trade accounts and notes receivable have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agricultural, construction
and commercial and consumer business sectors as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area.

The
maximum terms for retail notes are generally eight years for agricultural equipment, five years for construction equipment, six years for commercial and consumer equipment and
15 years for recreational products. The maximum term for financing leases is generally five years, while the maximum term for wholesale notes is generally 12 months.

The
company's United States and Canadian credit subsidiaries received proceeds of $2,482 million in 1999, $1,860 million in 1998 and $968 million in 1997 from the
sale of retail notes. At October 31, 1999 and 1998, the unpaid balances of retail notes previously sold were $2,716 million and $2,388 million, respectively. The company's maximum
exposure under all retail note recourse provisions at October 31, 1999 and 1998 was $176 million and $193 million, respectively. There is no anticipated credit risk related to
nonperformance by the counterparties. The retail notes sold are collateralized by security interests in the related equipment sold to customers. At October 31, 1999 and 1998, worldwide
financing receivables administered, which include financing receivables previously sold but still administered, totaled $9,459 million and $8,721 million, respectively.

Total
financing receivable amounts 60 days or more past due were $35 million at October 31, 1999 compared with $29 million at October 31, 1998.
These past-due amounts represented .52 percent of the receivables financed at October 31, 1999 and .44 percent at October 31, 1998. The allowance for doubtful
financing receivables represented 1.36 percent and 1.40 percent of financing receivables outstanding at October 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. In addition, at October 31,
1999 and 1998, the company's credit subsidiaries had $139 million and $176 million, respectively, of deposits withheld from dealers and merchants available for potential credit losses.

EQUIPMENT ON OPERATING LEASES

Operating leases arise from the leasing of John Deere equipment to retail customers in the United States and Canada. Initial lease terms generally range from
36 to 60 months. The net value of equipment on operating leases was $1,655 million and $1,209 million at October 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Of these leases, at
October 31, 1999, $3 million was financed by the Equipment Operations and $1,652 million by the credit subsidiaries. The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the leases. The accumulated depreciation on this equipment was $352 million and $226 million at October 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The corresponding
depreciation expense was $204 million in 1999, $146 million in 1998 and $95 million in 1997.

Future
payments to be received on operating leases totaled $648 million at October 31, 1999 and are scheduled as follows: 2000—$260, 2001—$189,
2002—$102, 2003—$69 and 2004—$28.

INVENTORIES

Substantially all inventories owned by Deere & Company and its United States equipment subsidiaries are valued at cost, on the "last-in,
first-out" (LIFO) basis. Remaining inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost, on the "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) basis, or market. The value of gross
inventories on the LIFO basis represented 77 percent and 84 percent of worldwide gross inventories at FIFO value on October 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. If all inventories had
been valued on a FIFO basis, estimated inventories by major classification at October 31 in millions of dollars would have been as follows:

Property
and equipment additions in 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $309 million, $442 million and $492 million and depreciation was $281 million,
$279 million and $265 million, respectively. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised products, increased capacity and the replacement or major renewal of significant
items of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred. Most of the company's property and equipment is
depreciated using the straight-line method for financial accounting purposes. Depreciation for United States federal income tax purposes is computed using accelerated depreciation methods.

It
is not expected that the cost of compliance with foreseeable environmental requirements will have a material effect on the company's financial position or results of operations.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Net intangible assets totaled $295 million and $218 million at October 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The balance at October 31,
1999 consisted primarily of unamortized goodwill, which resulted from the
purchase cost of assets acquired exceeding their fair value, and an intangible asset of $25 million related to the additional minimum pension liability required by FASB Statement No. 87.

Intangible
assets, excluding the intangible pension asset, are being amortized over 25 years or less, and the accumulated amortization was $89 million and
$66 million at October 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The intangible pension asset is remeasured and adjusted annually. The unamortized goodwill is reviewed periodically for potential
impairment.

The
weighted average interest rates on total short-term borrowings, excluding current maturities of long-term borrowings, at October 31, 1999 and 1998
were 5.3 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively. All of the Financial Services' short-term borrowings represent obligations of the credit subsidiaries.

Unsecured
lines of credit available from United States and foreign banks were $5,815 million at October 31, 1999. Some of these credit lines are available to both the
Equipment Operations and
certain credit subsidiaries. At October 31, 1999, $3,647 million of the worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, total
short-term borrowings, excluding the current maturities of long-term borrowings, were considered to constitute utilization.

Included
in the above lines of credit is a long-term committed credit agreement expiring in February 2003 for $3,500 million. The agreement is mutually
extendable and the annual facility fee is not significant. The credit agreement has various requirements of John Deere Capital Corporation, including the maintenance of its consolidated ratio of
earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt to total stockholder's equity plus subordinated debt at not more than 8 to 1 at the end of any
fiscal quarter. The credit agreement also contains a provision requiring Deere & Company to maintain consolidated tangible net worth of $500 million according to United States generally
accepted accounting principles in effect at October 31, 1994. Under this provision, $3,299 million of the company's retained earnings balance was free of restriction at
October 31, 1999.

Deere &
Company has a contractual agreement to conduct business with the John Deere Capital Corporation on such terms that the Capital Corporation will continue to satisfy the
ratio requirement discussed above for earnings to fixed charges, the Capital Corporation's tangible net worth will be maintained at not less than $50 million and Deere & Company will own
at least 51 percent of Capital Corporation's voting capital stock. These arrangements are not intended to make Deere & Company responsible for the payment of obligations of this credit
subsidiary.

2002—$768, 2003—$227 and 2004—$1.

LEASES

At October 31, 1999, future minimum lease payments under capital leases totaled $4 million. Total rental expense for operating leases during 1999
was $73 million compared with $73 million in 1998 and $61 million in 1997. At October 31, 1999, future minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to
$151 million as follows: 2000—$45, 2001—$34, 2002—$21, 2003—$13, 2004—$21 and later years $17.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

On October 31, 1999, the company's maximum exposure under all credit receivable recourse provisions was $176 million for retail notes sold by the
Financial Services subsidiaries. Also, at October 31, 1999, the company had commitments of approximately $57 million for construction and acquisition of property and equipment.

The
company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability, retail credit,
software licensing, patent and trademark matters. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, the company
believes these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

The
company has previously announced it would repurchase up to $1,500 million of Deere & Company common stock. The stock repurchased under the program to date totals
$1,308 million. In 1999, repurchases of 1.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $46 million were related to the repurchase program.

computation because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the company's common stock during the related periods.

STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

The company issues stock options and restricted stock to key employees under plans approved by stockholders. Restricted stock is also issued to nonemployee
directors. Options are generally awarded with the exercise price equal to the market price and become exercisable in one year. Certain other options are awarded with the exercise prices greater than
the market price and become exercisable in one year or longer, depending on the achievement of company performance goals. Options generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. The periods
of restriction for restricted stock issued to employees range up to eight years, generally depending on the achievement of company performance goals. If the company exceeds

these goals, additional shares could be granted at the end of the restricted periods. According to these plans at October 31, 1999, the company is authorized to grant stock options and
restricted stock for an additional 8.1 million and 2.8 million shares, respectively.

The
company has retained the intrinsic value method of accounting for its plans in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, and no compensation expense for stock options was
recognized under this method. For disclosure purposes only under FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to calculate
the "fair values" of stock options on the date the options were awarded. Based on this model, the weighted-average fair values of stock options awarded during 1999, 1998 and 1997 with the exercise
price equal to the market price were $7.96, $19.84 and $13.70 per option, respectively. Stock options awarded during 1999 and 1998 with the exercise price greater than the market price were valued at
$4.26 and $14.81 per option, respectively.

Fair Value Estimates

Fair values of the long-term financing receivables with fixed rates were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at current
market interest rates. The fair values of the remaining financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts.

Fair
values of long-term borrowings with fixed rates were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at current market interest rates. Certain
long-term borrowings of the credit operations have been swapped to current variable interest rates. Fair values of these swaps were also based on discounted values of their related cash
flows at current market interest rates.

Fair
values and carrying values of the company's other interest rate swaps associated with short-term borrowings, foreign exchange forward contracts and options were not
material.

Derivatives

The company enters into derivative transactions only to hedge exposures arising in the normal course of business, and not for the purpose of creating
speculative positions or trading. The following notional or contract amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not representative of the company's risk. The net
amounts exchanged are calculated on the basis of the notional amounts and other terms of the derivatives such as interest rates and exchange rates, and represent only a small portion of the notional
amounts. The credit and market risks under these agreements are not considered to be significant since the counterparties have high credit ratings and the fair values and carrying values are not
material.

Interest Rate Swaps

The company's credit operations enter into interest rate swap agreements related to their borrowings and certain asset backed securitizations. These swaps are
utilized to more closely match the type of interest rates of the borrowings to those of the assets being funded or to hedge interest rate exposures from securitizations. The differential to be paid or
received on all swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognized over the lives of the agreements in interest expense. The fair value adjustments for swap agreements related to
securitizations are recognized in other income.

At
October 31, 1999 and 1998, the total notional principal amounts of interest rate swap agreements related to short-term borrowings were $1,037 million and
$1,063 million, having rates of 4.7 to 6.8 percent and 4.0 to 6.4 percent, terminating in up to 59 months and 58 months, respectively.

The
credit operations have entered into interest rate swap agreements with independent parties that change the effective rate of interest on certain long-term borrowings.
The "Long-Term Borrowings" table on page 39 reflects the effective year-end variable interest rates relating to these swap agreements. The notional principal amounts and
maturity dates of these swap agreements are the same as the principal amounts and maturities of the related borrowings. The credit operations also have interest rate swap agreements associated with
medium-term notes. The "Long-Term Borrowings" table reflects the interest rates relating to these swap agreements. At October 31, 1999 and 1998, the total notional
principal amounts of these swap agreements were $540 million and $375 million, terminating in up to 92 months and 104 months, respectively.

At
October 31, 1999, the total notional principal amount of interest rate swap agreements related to asset backed securitizations was $361 million, having rates of
4.7 percent to 5.9 percent, terminating in up to 68 months.

Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts, Swaps and Options

The company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts, swaps and purchased options in order to hedge the currency exposure of certain receivables,
liabilities, expected inventory purchases and equipment sales. The foreign exchange forward contract and swap gains or losses are accrued as foreign exchange rates change for hedges of receivables and
liabilities or deferred until expiration of the contract for hedges of future commitments. The contract gains or losses and premiums are recognized in other operating expenses, cost of sales or
interest expense, and the premiums are either amortized or deferred over the terms of the contracts depending on the items being hedged. The foreign exchange purchased option premiums and any gains
are deferred and recognized in cost of sales for future inventory purchases or sales for future sales of equipment. At October 31, 1999 and 1998, the company had foreign exchange forward
contracts of $778 million and $697 million maturing in
up to 19 months and 12 months, respectively, and foreign currency swap agreements for $147 million and $237 million maturing in up to 43 months and 55 months,
respectively. At October 31, 1999 and 1998, the company had purchased options for $131 million and $215 million maturing in up to 23 months and 27 months,
respectively. The total deferred gains or losses on these foreign exchange hedges were not material at October 31, 1999 and 1998.

CASH FLOW INFORMATION

For purposes of the statement of consolidated cash flows, the company considers investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Substantially all of the company's short-term borrowings mature within three months or less.

regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in year 2000. Timberjack Group, a leading manufacturer of forestry equipment, reported annual sales of $580 million in 1998. This
acquisition will broaden the forestry product line and customer base for the company's construction equipment segment.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

Sensitivity Analysis

The following is a sensitivity analysis for the company's derivatives and other financial instruments which have interest rate risk. These instruments are held
for other than trading purposes. The gains or losses in the following table represent the changes in the financial instruments' fair values which would be caused by decreasing the interest rates by
10 percent of the current market rates at October 31,1999 and increasing the interest rates by 10 percent of the current market rates at October 31, 1998. The fair values
were determined based on the discounted values of their related cash flows. The gains or losses in fair values would have been as follows in millions of dollars:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Deere
& Company:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deere & Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1999 and 1998 and the related statements of
consolidated income, changes in consolidated stockholders' equity and consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1999. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index under Part IV, Item 14(a)(2). These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Deere & Company and subsidiaries at
October 31, 1999 and 1998 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.
