PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

Products

Deere &
Company (Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively called John Deere) have
operations which are categorized into four major business segments.

The

agricultural equipment

segment manufactures and distributes
a full line of farm equipment and related service parts — including tractors;
combine, cotton and sugarcane harvesters; tillage, seeding and soil preparation
machinery; sprayers; hay and forage equipment; integrated agricultural
management systems technology; and precision agricultural irrigation equipment.

The

commercial and consumer equipment

segment manufactures and
distributes equipment, products and service parts for commercial and
residential uses — including tractors for lawn, garden, commercial and utility
purposes; mowing equipment, including walk-behind mowers; golf course
equipment; utility vehicles; landscape and nursery products; irrigation
equipment; and other outdoor power products.

The

construction and forestry

segment manufactures, distributes
to dealers and sells at retail a broad range of machines and service parts used
in construction, earthmoving, material handling and timber harvesting —
including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive
loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders;
skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log
forwarders, log harvesters and related attachments.

The products and
services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through
independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.

The

credit

segment primarily finances sales and leases by John
Deere dealers of new and used agricultural, commercial and consumer, and
construction and forestry equipment. In addition, it provides wholesale
financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, provides operating loans,
finances retail revolving charge accounts, offers certain crop risk mitigation
products and invests in wind energy generation.

John Deere’s
worldwide agricultural equipment; commercial and consumer equipment; and
construction and forestry operations are sometimes referred to as the “Equipment
Operations.” The credit and certain miscellaneous service operations are
sometimes referred to as “Financial Services.”

Additional
information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic
area results on pages 16 and 17. The John Deere enterprise has
manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837. The present Company was
incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1958.

The Company’s
Internet address is http://www.JohnDeere.com. Through that address, the Company’s
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available free of
charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The information contained on the Company’s
website is not included in, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Market
Conditions and Outlook

Company equipment sales
are projected to increase by about 12 percent for the full year 2008 and to be
up approximately 25 percent for the first quarter of 2008. The operations of LESCO, Inc.
(LESCO), a supplier of landscape products acquired by John Deere in May 2007,
are expected to account for about 2 percentage points of the sales increase for
the year and 3 points in the first quarter. The Company’s net income is
forecast to be about $2.1 billion for 2008 and about $325 million for the first
quarter.

Agricultural Equipment

. Driven by continuing strength in the farm sector, worldwide
sales of John Deere agricultural equipment are expected to increase by about 17
percent for fiscal year 2008. Included in the segment’s sales forecast is one


percentage point for
currency translation and one point related to the acquisition of Ningbo Benye
Tractor & Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd., a Chinese-based tractor
manufacturer purchased by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Worldwide farm conditions
remain quite positive, benefiting from growing economic prosperity, healthy
commodity prices and demand for renewable fuels. Relative to consumption,
global grain stocks such as wheat and corn are continuing to run at or near thirty-year
lows. The Company’s sales are expected to receive further support from the
planned introduction of a number of advanced new products globally.

On an industry basis,
sales of farm machinery in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be up 10 to 15
percent for the year, due in part to a substantial jump in farm cash
receipts. Large tractors and combines are expected to pace the sales
improvement, while demand for cotton pickers is expected to be lower. Industry
sales in Western Europe are forecast to be flat to up slightly for the year
with greater increases expected in Eastern Europe and the CIS (Commonwealth of
Independent States) countries, including Russia. These latter areas are
expected to continue experiencing strong growth due to rising demand for
productive farm machinery. South American markets are expected to show further
improvement in 2008, with industry sales forecast to increase by 10 to 15
percent. Farm machinery demand in Brazil, while receiving support from strong
commodity prices, may be tempered by uncertainties over the status of
government-backed financing programs. The Company anticipates its sales will be
helped by an expanded product line and additional production capacity
associated with the opening of a new tractor manufacturing facility in
Montenegro, Brazil.

Commercial & Consumer Equipment.

The Company’s
commercial and consumer equipment sales are projected to be up about 10 percent
for the year, including about 8 percentage points from a full year of LESCO
sales. Segment sales, in addition, are expected to benefit from new products,
such as an expanded line of innovative commercial mowing equipment. Given the
nature of the Company’s commercial and consumer businesses, sales tend to have
a high degree of sensitivity to weather patterns. Sales of residential
equipment are also affected by U.S. housing markets.

Construction & Forestry.

U.S. markets for
construction and forestry equipment are forecast to remain under pressure in
2008 due in large part to a continuing slump in housing starts.
Non-residential construction is expected to remain flat at last year’s
relatively strong levels. Pressure on the U.S. housing market is expected to
contribute to lower worldwide sales of forestry equipment in 2008, though sales
in Europe are forecast to remain at strong levels. Despite this generally weak
environment, the Company’s sales are expected to benefit from new products and
a return to factory production levels in closer alignment with retail demand.
Last year, the Company made a significant reduction in construction and
forestry inventories, which restrained production. In addition, the Company’s
sales to the independent rental channel, which saw a large decline in 2007, are
expected to be flat in the coming year. For 2008, the Company’s worldwide sales
of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to be approximately equal
to the prior year.

Credit.

Fiscal
year 2008 net income for the Company’s credit operations is forecast to be
approximately $375 million, with the improvement driven by growth in the credit
portfolio.

2007 Consolidated Results Compared with 2006

Worldwide net income in 2007
was $1,822 million, or $4.00 per share diluted ($4.05 basic), compared with
$1,694 million, or $3.59 per share diluted ($3.63 basic), in 2006. Income from
continuing operations, which excludes the Company’s discontinued health care
business (see Note 2), was also $1,822 million, or $4.00 per share diluted
($4.05 basic), in 2007, compared with $1,453 million, or $3.08 per share
diluted ($3.11 basic) in 2006. Net sales and revenues from continuing
operations increased 9 percent to $24,082 million in 2007, compared with
$22,148 million in 2006. Net sales of the Equipment Operations increased 8
percent in 2007 to $21,489 million from $19,884 million last year. This
included a positive effect for currency translation and price changes of 5
percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada were flat in 2007. Net sales outside
the U.S. and Canada increased by 27 percent, which included a positive effect
of 7 percent for currency translation. All per share information reflects a
two-for-one stock split effective November 26, 2007 (see Note 1 to
Consolidated Financial Statements).

Worldwide Equipment
Operations had an operating profit of $2,318 million in 2007, compared with
$1,905 million in 2006. Higher operating profit was primarily due to improved
price realization and higher sales and production volumes. Partially offsetting
these factors were higher selling, administrative and general expenses,
increased raw material costs and higher research and development costs.


The Equipment Operations’
net income was $1,429 million in 2007, compared with $1,089 million in 2006.
The same operating factors mentioned above along with the expense related to
the repurchase of certain outstanding debt securities last year and lower
effective tax rates this year affected these results.

Net income of the Company’s
Financial Services operations in 2007 decreased to $364 million, compared with
$584 million in 2006, primarily due to the sale of the health care operations
last year. Income from the Financial Services continuing operations in 2007 was
also $364 million, compared with $344 million in 2006. The increase was
primarily a result of growth in the credit portfolio, partially offset by
increased selling, administrative and general expenses and a higher provision
for credit losses. Additional information is presented in the discussion of the
“Credit Operations.”

Income from discontinued
operations was $241 million in 2006, or $.51 per share diluted ($.52 basic),
primarily due to the sale of the health care operations last year.

The cost of sales to net
sales ratio for 2007 was 75.6 percent, compared with 77.3 percent last year.
The decrease was primarily due to improved price realization and higher sales and
production volumes, partially offset by higher raw material costs.

Finance and interest income,
and interest expense increased this year primarily due to growth in the credit operations
portfolio and higher financing rates. Other income increased this year
primarily from increased service revenues. Research and development costs
increased this year due to increased spending in support of new products and
the effect of currency translation. Selling, administrative and general
expenses increased primarily due to growth and the effect of currency
translation. Other operating expenses were higher primarily as a result of
increased cost of services, higher depreciation expense on operating lease
equipment and the effect of currency translation, partially offset by the
expense related to the repurchase of outstanding notes last year (see Note 3).

The Company has several
defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life
insurance plans. The Company’s postretirement benefit costs for these plans in
2007 were $415 million, compared with $447 million in 2006. The long-term
expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an
expected gain of 8.3 percent in 2007 and 8.4 percent in 2006, or $838 million
in 2007, compared with $795 million in 2006. The actual return was a gain of
$1,503 million in 2007, compared with a gain of $1,364 million in 2006. In
2008, the expected return will be approximately 8.2 percent. The Company
expects postretirement benefit costs in 2008 to be lower, compared with 2007,
primarily due to lower amortizations of actuarial losses. The Company makes any
required contributions to the plan assets under applicable regulations and
voluntary contributions from time to time based on the Company’s liquidity and
ability to make tax-deductible contributions. Total Company contributions to
the plans were $646 million in 2007 and $866 million in 2006, which include
direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. These contributions also included
voluntary contributions to total plan assets of approximately $520 million in
2007 and $760 million in 2006. Total Company contributions in 2008 are expected
to be approximately $428 million, including voluntary contributions to plan
assets of approximately $300 million. See the following discussion of “Critical
Accounting Policies” for more information about postretirement benefit
obligations.

Additional
information on 2007 results is presented on pages 15 - 17.

EQUIPMENT
OPERATIONS

Agricultural
Equipment

Sales of agricultural equipment, particularly in the
United States and Canada, are affected by total farm cash receipts, which
reflect levels of farm commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields and the
amount and timing of government payments. Sales are also influenced by general
economic conditions, farm land prices, farmers’ debt levels, interest rates,
agricultural trends, including the production of and demand for renewable
fuels, energy costs and other input costs associated with farming. Other
important factors affecting new equipment sales are the value and level of used
equipment, including tractors, harvesting equipment, self-propelled sprayers
and seeding equipment. Weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying
decisions of equipment purchasers.

Innovations to machinery
and technology also influence buying. For example, larger, more productive
equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in
their operations. The Company has developed a comprehensive agricultural
management systems approach using advanced technology and global satellite
positioning to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields, improve
soil conservation and minimize chemical use and to gather information.


Large, cost-efficient,
highly-mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of
worldwide farm output. The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms
has been particularly important to John Deere. A large proportion of the
Equipment Operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the United States
is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower, self-propelled combines,
self-propelled cotton pickers, self-propelled forage harvesters and
self-propelled sprayers.

Seasonality

.
Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in
substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail
customers during various times of the year. Seasonal demand must be estimated
in advance, and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand
in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout
the year. For certain equipment, the Company offers early order discounts to
retail customers. Production schedules are based, in part, on these early order
programs. The agricultural equipment segment incurs substantial seasonal
variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of equipment. The agricultural
equipment segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of
seasonal demand. New combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold
under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to
customers who take delivery of machines during off-season periods. In the
United States and Canada, used equipment trade-ins, of which there are
typically several transactions for every new combine and cotton harvesting
equipment sale, are supported with a fixed pool of funds available to dealers
which are then responsible for all associated inventory and sale costs.

An important part of the competition within the
agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse
variety of short-line and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing
and marketing methods. Because of industry conditions, especially the merger of
certain large integrated competitors and the global capability of many
competitors, the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo
significant change and may become even more competitive.

Commercial
and Consumer Equipment

The John Deere commercial and consumer segment
includes lawn and garden tractors, compact utility tractors, residential and
commercial zero-turn radius mowers, front mowers, utility vehicles, and golf
and turf equipment. A broad line of associated implements for mowing, tilling,
snow and debris handling, aerating, and many other residential, commercial,
golf and sports turf care applications are also included. The product line also
includes walk-behind mowers and other outdoor power products. Retail sales of
these commercial and consumer equipment products are influenced by weather
conditions, consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions. To
increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories
through the year the production and shipment schedules of the Company’s product
lines closely correspond to the seasonal pattern of retail sales.

The Company
manufactures and sells walk-behind mowers in Europe under the SABO brand as
well as the John Deere brand. The division also builds products for sale by
mass retailers. Since 1999, the Company has built products for sale through The
Home Depot. In 2006, the Company began selling products through Lowe’s as well.

John Deere
Landscapes, Inc., a unit of the segment, distributes irrigation equipment,
nursery products and landscape supplies, including seed, fertilizer and
hardscape materials, primarily to landscape service professionals. In 2007,
John Deere acquired LESCO, Inc., expanding its customer base for these
products.

In addition to the
equipment manufactured by the Commercial and Consumer segment, John Deere
purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale.

Seasonality.

Retail demand for
the segment’s equipment normally is higher in the second and third quarters. The
division is pursuing a strategy of building and shipping as close to retail
demand as possible. Consequently, production, shipping and retail sales
normally will be proportionately higher in the second and third quarters of
each year.

Construction
and Forestry

John Deere construction,
earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment includes a broad range of
backhoe loaders, crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders,
excavators, motor graders, articulated dump trucks, landscape loaders,
skid-steer loaders, log skidders, log feller bunchers, log loaders, log
forwarders, log harvesters and a variety of attachments.

Today, this segment
provides sizes of equipment that compete for over 90 percent of the estimated
total North American market for those categories of construction, earthmoving
and material handling equipment in which it competes. This segment also
provides the most complete line of forestry machines and attachments available
in the world. These forestry


machines and attachments
are distributed under the Deere, Timberjack and Waratah brand names. In
addition to the equipment manufactured by the Construction and Forestry segment,
John Deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale.

The prevailing levels of
residential, commercial and public construction and the condition of the forest
products industry influence retail sales of John Deere construction,
earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment. General economic
conditions, the level of interest rates and certain commodity prices such as
those applicable to pulp, paper and saw logs also influence sales.

The Company and Hitachi
have a joint venture for the manufacture of hydraulic excavators and track log
loaders in the United States and Canada. The Company also distributes Hitachi
brands of construction and mining equipment in North, Central and South
America. The Company also has supply agreements with Hitachi under which a
range of construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry products manufactured
by John Deere in the United States, Finland and New Zealand are distributed by
Hitachi in certain Asian markets.

The division has a number
of initiatives in the rent-to-rent, or short-term rental, market for
construction, earthmoving and material handling equipment. These include
specially designed rental programs for John Deere dealers and expanded
cooperation with major, national equipment rental companies.

The Company also
owns Nortrax, Inc., Nortrax Investments, Inc. and Ontrac Equipment
Services, Inc. (collectively called Nortrax). Nortrax is an authorized
John Deere dealer for construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry
equipment in a variety of markets in the United States and Canada.

Engineering and Research

John Deere invests
heavily in engineering and research to improve the quality and performance of
its products, and to develop new products. Such expenditures were $817 million
or 3.8 percent of net sales of equipment in 2007, $726 million or 3.7 percent
in 2006, and $677 million or 3.5 percent in 2005.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing
Plants

. In the United States and Canada, the Equipment
Operations own and operate 18 factory locations and lease and operate another four
locations, which contain approximately 27.4 million square feet of floor space.
Of these 22 factories, 13 are devoted primarily to agricultural equipment, four
to commercial and consumer equipment, two to construction and forestry
equipment, and one engine and two hydraulic and power train component
facilities. Outside the United States and Canada, the Equipment Operations own or
lease and operate:  agricultural
equipment factories in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Mexico, the
Netherlands and Russia; engine factories in Argentina, France, India and
Mexico; a component factory in Spain; a commercial and consumer equipment
factory in Germany and forestry equipment factories in Finland and New Zealand.
These factories outside the United States and Canada contain approximately 14.8
million square feet of floor space. The Equipment Operations also have
financial interests in other manufacturing organizations, which include
agricultural equipment manufacturers in the United States, an industrial truck
manufacturer in South Africa, the Hitachi joint venture that builds hydraulic
excavators and track log loaders in the United States and Canada and ventures
that manufacture transaxles and transmissions used in certain Commercial and Consumer
equipment segment products.

The engine
factories referred to above manufacture non-road, heavy duty diesel engines a
majority of which are manufactured for the Company’s Equipment Operations; the
remaining engines are sold to other regional and global original equipment
manufacturers.

John Deere’s facilities
are well maintained, in good operating condition and are suitable for their
present purposes. These facilities, together with both short-term and long-term
planned capital expenditures, are expected to meet John Deere’s manufacturing
needs in the foreseeable future.

Capacity is
adequate to satisfy the Company’s current expectations for retail market
demand. The Equipment Operations’ manufacturing strategy involves the
implementation of appropriate levels of technology and automation to allow
manufacturing processes to remain profitable at varying production levels.
Operations are also designed to be flexible enough to accommodate the product
design changes required to meet market conditions. Common manufacturing
facilities and techniques are employed in the production of components for
agricultural, commercial and consumer and construction and forestry equipment.


In order to utilize
manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, the Equipment
Operations pursue continuous improvements in manufacturing processes. These
include steps to streamline manufacturing processes and enhance responsiveness
to customers. The Company has implemented flexible assembly lines that can
handle a wider product mix and deliver products when dealers and customers
require them. Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to
manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design,
advanced manufacturing technology, enhanced environmental management systems,
supply management and logistics as well as compensation incentives related to
productivity and organizational structure. The Company continues to experience
raw materials and fuel cost pressures. The Company has offset and expects to continue
to offset any increased costs through the above-described cost reduction
measures and through pricing. Significant cost increases, if they occur, could
have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results. The Equipment
Operations also pursue external sales of selected parts and components that can
be manufactured and supplied to third parties on a competitive basis.

Capital Expenditures.

The
agricultural equipment, commercial and consumer equipment and construction and
forestry operations’ capital expenditures totaled $575 million in 2007,
compared with $481 million in 2006, and $465 million in 2005. Provisions for
depreciation applicable to these operations’ property, plant and equipment
during these years were $389 million, $370 million, and $349 million
respectively. Capital expenditures for the Equipment Operations in 2008 are
currently estimated to be $600 million to $700 million. The 2008 expenditures
will relate primarily to the modernization and restructuring of key
manufacturing facilities and will also relate to the development of new
products. Future levels of capital expenditures will depend on business
conditions.

Patents
and Trademarks

John Deere owns a
significant number of patents, licenses and trademarks. The Company believes
that, in the aggregate, the rights under these patents, licenses and trademarks
are generally important to its operations, but does not consider that any
patent, license, trademark or related group of them (other than its house
trademarks, which include but are not limited to the “John Deere” mark, the
leaping deer logo, the “Nothing Runs Like a Deere” slogan and green and yellow
equipment colors) is of material importance in relation to John Deere’s
business.

Marketing

In the United
States and Canada, the Equipment Operations distribute equipment and service
parts through the following facilities (collectively called sales
branches):  one agricultural equipment
and one commercial and consumer equipment sales and administration office each
supported by seven agricultural equipment and commercial and consumer equipment
sales branches; and one construction, earthmoving, material handling and
forestry equipment sales and administration office.

In addition, the
Equipment Operations operate a centralized parts distribution warehouse in
coordination with several regional parts depots in the United States and Canada
and have an agreement with a third party to operate a high-volume parts
warehouse in Indiana.

The sales branches
in the United States and Canada market John Deere products at approximately 2,984
dealer locations, most of which are independently owned. Of these,
approximately 1,581 sell agricultural equipment, while 510 sell construction,
earthmoving, material handling and/or forestry equipment. Nortrax owns some of
the 510 locations. Commercial and consumer equipment is sold by most John Deere
agricultural equipment dealers, a few construction, earthmoving, material
handling and forestry equipment dealers, and about 717 commercial and consumer
equipment dealers, many of which also handle competitive brands and dissimilar
lines of products. In addition, certain lawn and garden product lines are sold
through The Home Depot and Lowe’s.

John Deere
Landscapes operates its business from 299 branch locations throughout the
United States and Canada, along with an additional 358 LESCO locations and 112 “Stores-on-Wheels”
acquired in May 2007 with the acquisition of LESCO, Inc.

Outside the United
States and Canada, John Deere agricultural equipment is sold to distributors
and dealers for resale in over 100 countries. Sales branches are located in
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, France, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland,
Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom
and Uruguay. Export sales branches are located in Europe and the United States.
Associated companies doing business in China also sell agricultural equipment.
Commercial and consumer equipment sales outside the United States and Canada
occur primarily in Europe and Australia. Construction, earthmoving, material
handling and forestry equipment is sold to distributors and dealers primarily
by sales offices located in the United States, Brazil, Singapore and Finland. Some
of these dealers are independently owned while the Company owns others.


John Deere engines are
marketed worldwide through five sales branches to large original equipment
manufacturers and independently owned engine distributors.

Trade
Accounts and Notes Receivable

Trade accounts and notes
receivable arise primarily from sales of goods to independent dealers. Most
trade receivables originated by the Equipment Operations are purchased by
Financial Services. The Equipment Operations compensate Financial Services at
market rates of interest for these receivables. Additional information appears
in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL
SERVICES

Credit
Operations

United
States and Canada

. The Company’s credit subsidiaries
(collectively referred to as the Credit Companies) primarily provide and
administer financing for retail purchases from John Deere dealers of new
equipment manufactured by the Company’s agricultural equipment, commercial and
consumer equipment, and construction and forestry divisions and used equipment
taken in trade for this equipment. Deere & Company and John Deere
Construction & Forestry Company are referred to as the “sales
companies.” John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a United
States credit subsidiary, generally purchases retail installment sales and loan
contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. These retail notes are
acquired by the sales companies through John Deere retail dealers in the United
States. John Deere Credit Inc., a Canadian credit subsidiary, purchases and
finances retail notes acquired by John Deere Limited, the Company’s Canadian sales
branch. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the Credit Companies
acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with
the sales companies. The Credit Companies also finance and service revolving
charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in
the agricultural, commercial and consumer, and construction and forestry markets
(revolving charge accounts). Further, the Credit Companies finance and service
operating loans, in most cases offered through and acquired from farm input
providers or through direct relationships with agricultural producers or
agribusinesses (operating loans). Additionally, the Credit Companies provide
wholesale financing for inventories of John Deere agricultural, commercial and
consumer, and construction and forestry equipment owned by dealers of those
products (wholesale notes). In the United States, the Credit Companies also
offer certain crop risk mitigation products and invest in wind energy
generation.

Retail notes
acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the Credit Companies.
The Equipment Operations are the Credit Companies’ major source of business,
but many retail purchasers of John Deere products finance their purchases
outside the John Deere organization.

The Credit
Companies offer retail leases to equipment users in the United States. A small
number of leases are executed with units of local government. Leases are
usually written for periods of two to five years, and frequently contain an
option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the
lease term. Retail leases are also offered in a generally similar manner to
customers in Canada through John Deere Credit Inc. and John Deere Limited.

The Credit
Companies’ terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items
financed with unsecured revolving charge accounts) provide for retention of a
security interest in the equipment financed. The Credit Companies’ guidelines
for minimum down payments, which vary with the types of equipment and repayment
provisions, are generally not less than 20 percent on agricultural equipment,
10 percent on construction and forestry equipment and 10 percent on lawn and
grounds care equipment used for personal use. Finance charges are sometimes
waived for specified periods or reduced on certain John Deere products sold or
leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions. The Credit
Companies generally receive compensation from the sales companies equal to a
competitive interest rate for periods during which finance charges are waived
or reduced on the retail notes or leases. The cost is accounted for as a deduction
in arriving at net sales by the Equipment Operations.

The Company has an
agreement with the Capital Corporation to make income maintenance payments to
the Capital Corporation such that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not
less than 1.05 to 1 for any fiscal quarter. For 2007 and 2006, the Capital
Corporation’s ratios were 1.54 to 1 and 1.60 to 1, respectively, and never less
than 1.54 to 1 and 1.53 to 1 for any fiscal quarter of 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The Company has also committed to continue to own at least 51
percent of the voting shares of capital stock of the Capital Corporation and to
maintain the Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth at not less
than $50 million. The Company’s obligations to make payments to the Capital
Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether the Capital
Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities.
Further, the Company’s


obligations under the
agreement are not measured by the amount of the Capital Corporation’s
indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. The Company’s obligations to
make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of
any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of the Capital Corporation
and are enforceable only by or in the name of the Capital Corporation. No
payments were required under this agreement in 2007 or 2006.

Outside
the United States and Canada

. The Credit Companies also offer
financing, primarily for John Deere products, in Australia, New Zealand,
Russia, and in several countries in Europe and in Latin America. In certain
areas, financing is offered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures.
Financing outside of the United States and Canada is affected by a variety of
customs and regulations.

The Credit Companies also
offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export
financing for the purchase of John Deere products.

Capital
Expenditures

. The Credit Companies’ capital expenditures
totaled $450 million in 2007, compared with $292 million in 2006, and $46
million in 2005. Provisions for depreciation applicable to these operations’
property, plant and equipment during these years were $13 million, $8 million and
$5 million respectively. Capital expenditures for the credit operations in 2008
are currently estimated to be $550 million. The increases in capital
expenditures since 2004 have related primarily to wind energy generation.

Additional information on
the Credit Companies appears on pages 16, 17, and 19.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS

The Company is subject to
a wide variety of state, federal and international environmental laws, rules and
regulations. These laws, rules and regulations may affect the way the
Company conducts its operations, and failure to comply with these regulations
could lead to fines and other penalties. The Company is also involved in the
evaluation and clean-up of a limited number of sites. Management does not
expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company. With
respect to acquired properties and businesses, the Company cannot be certain
that it has identified all adverse environmental conditions. The Company
expects that it will acquire additional properties and businesses in the
future.

EMPLOYEES

At October 31,
2007, John Deere had approximately 52,000 full-time employees, including
approximately 29,800 employees in the United States and Canada. From time to
time, John Deere also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary
and part-time workers. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for
approximately 35

percent of John Deere’s United
States employees. Most of the Company’s United States production and
maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the
United Auto Workers (UAW), with an expiration date of September 30, 2009.

Unions also
represent the majority of employees at John Deere manufacturing facilities
outside the United States.


EXECUTIVE
OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

Following are the
names and ages of the executive officers of the Company, their positions with
the Company and summaries of their backgrounds and business experience. All
executive officers are elected or appointed by the Board of Directors and hold
office until the annual meeting of the Board of Directors following the annual
meeting of stockholders in each year.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
FACTORS.

Governmental
Actions

. The Company’s agricultural business is exposed to a
variety of risks and uncertainties related to the action or inaction of
governmental bodies. The outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices
of the World Trade Organization could have a material effect on the
international flow of agricultural commodities which may result in a
corresponding effect on the demand for agricultural equipment in many areas of
the world.

In the United
States, the 2007 Farm Bill may significantly affect prices for farm
commodities, particularly corn, cotton and rice, and this in turn could affect
farmers’ demand for the Company’s products and services.

The policies of
the Brazilian government (including those related to exchange rates and
commodity prices) could significantly change the dynamics of the agricultural
economy in that country.


Changing
Demand for Farm Outputs

. Changing worldwide demand for food
and the demand for different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on prices
for farm commodities and consequently the demand for the Company’s agricultural
equipment.

Globalization

.
The continuing globalization of agricultural businesses may significantly
change the dynamics of the Company’s competition, customer base and product
offerings. The Company’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large
extent on its success in developing additional geographic markets.

Economic
Condition and Outlook

. General economic conditions can affect
the demand for the Company’s equipment as well. Negative economic conditions or
a negative outlook, for example, can decrease housing starts and other
construction and dampen demand for equipment. Weakness in the overall farm
economy can have a similar effect on agricultural equipment sales.

Consumer
Attitudes

. The confidence the Company’s customers have in the
general economic outlook can have a significant effect on their propensity to
purchase equipment and, consequently, on the Company’s sales. The Company’s
ability to match its new product offerings to its customers’ anticipated
preferences for enhanced technologies and different types and sizes of
equipment is important as well.

Weather.

Poor
or unusual weather conditions, particularly in the spring, can significantly
affect the purchasing decisions of the Company’s customers, particularly the
customers of the agricultural and commercial and consumer segments. Sales in
the important spring selling season can have a dramatic effect on the
commercial and consumer segment’s financial results.

Raw
Material Costs

. Changes in the availability and price of raw
materials (such as steel, rubber and fuel) used in the production of the
Company’s equipment could have an effect on its costs of production and, in
turn, on the profitability of the business.

Interest
Rates and Credit Ratings

. If interest rates rise, they could
have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and could affect the
demand for the Company’s equipment. In addition, credit market dislocations
could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to the Company’s
credit segment. Decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the
availability and cost of funding for the Company. Credit rating downgrades or
negative changes to ratings outlooks can increase the Company’s cost of capital
and hurt its competitive position. Guidance from rating agencies as to
acceptable leverage can affect the Company’s returns as well.

Environmental.

Our
operations are subject to and affected by environmental, health and
safety laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities in the
United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign
operations. Violations of such laws or regulations can lead to
investigation and remediation costs, significant fines or penalties. In
addition, increased requirements of governmental authorities, and claims for
damages to property or injury to persons resulting from the environmental,
health or safety impacts of our operations or past contamination, could prevent
or restrict our operations, require significant expenditures to achieve
compliance, involve the imposition of cleanup liens and/or give rise to civil
or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such
legislation and/or regulations, which results in enforcement actions or private
claims will not have consequences which result in a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The risks
identified above should be considered in conjunction with Management’s
Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 15, and, specifically, the other
risks described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 17 and 18. The
Company’s results of operations may be affected by these identified risks
and/or by risks not currently contemplated.

PROPERTIES.

See “Manufacturing”
in Item 1.

The Equipment
Operations own 13 facilities housing sales branches, one centralized parts
depot, regional parts depots, transfer houses and warehouses throughout the
United States and Canada. These facilities contain approximately 4.3 million
square feet of floor space. The Equipment Operations also own and occupy
buildings housing sales branches, one centralized parts depot and regional
parts depots in Australia, Brazil, Europe and New Zealand. These facilities
contain approximately 1.0 million square feet of floor space.


Deere &
Company administrative offices and research facilities, all of which are owned
by John Deere, together contain about 2.6 million square feet of floor space
and miscellaneous other facilities total 1.0 million square feet.

Overall, the
Company owns approximately 48.8 million square feet of facilities and leases
approximately 12.3 million additional square feet in various locations.

ITEM
3.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is
subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of
its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability
(including asbestos-related liability), retail credit, software licensing,
patent and trademark matters. Although it is not possible to predict with
certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of
possible loss, the Company believes these unresolved legal actions will not
have a material effect on its financial statements.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Deere & Company’s internal control system was
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2007, using the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of October 31, 2007,
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. That
report is included herein.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS
ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005

OVERVIEW

Organization

The company’s Equipment
Operations generate revenues and cash primarily from the sale of equipment to
John Deere dealers and distributors. The Equipment Operations manufacture and distribute
a full line of agricultural equipment; a variety of commercial and consumer
equipment; and a broad range of equipment for construction and forestry. The
company’s continuing Financial Services primarily provide credit services, which
mainly finance sales and leases of equipment by John Deere dealers and trade
receivables purchased from the Equipment Operations. In addition, Financial
Services offer certain crop risk mitigation products and invest in wind energy
generation. The health care operations, included in Financial Services, were
classified as discontinued operations due to their sale (see Note 2). These
operations provided managed health care services for the company and certain
outside customers. The information in the following discussion is presented in
a format that includes information grouped as consolidated, Equipment
Operations and Financial Services. The company also views its operations as
consisting of two geographic areas, the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S.
and Canada.

Trends and Economic Conditions

The company’s businesses are
currently affected by the following key trends and economic conditions.
Worldwide farm conditions remain positive, benefiting from growing economic
prosperity, healthy commodity prices and demand for renewable fuels. Industry
sales of farm machinery in the U.S. and Canada in 2008 are expected to be up 10
to 15 percent for the year, while sales in Western Europe are forecast to be
flat to up slightly. South American industry sales for 2008 are expected to
increase by 10 to 15 percent. The company’s agricultural equipment net sales
were up 18 percent for 2007 and are forecast to be up approximately 17 percent
in 2008. The company’s commercial and consumer equipment net sales were up 12
percent in 2007, including about 9 percent from LESCO, Inc. (LESCO), which
was acquired in May 2007. Commercial and consumer equipment sales are
forecast to be up about 10 percent in 2008, including about 8 percent from a
full year’s sales from LESCO. U.S. markets for construction and forestry
equipment are forecast to remain under pressure in 2008 due in large part to a continuing
slump in housing starts. The company’s construction and forestry net sales
decreased 13 percent in 2007 and are forecast to be approximately flat in 2008.
Net income for the company’s credit operations in 2008 is expected to improve
to approximately $375 million due to growth in the credit portfolio.

Items of concern include the
price of raw materials and certain supply constraints, which have an impact on
the results of the company’s equipment operations. The impacts of inflation and
sub-prime credit issues, which could affect interest rates and the housing
market, are also a concern. Producing engines that continue to meet high
performance standards, yet also comply with increasingly stringent emissions
regulations is one of the company’s major priorities. In this regard, the
company is making and intends to continue to make the financial and technical
investment needed to produce engines in conformance with global emissions rules for
off-road diesel engines. Potential changes in government sponsored farmer
financing programs and supplier constraints in Brazil are a concern. In addition,
there is uncertainty over the direction of U.S. farm legislation.

In 2007, the company
benefited from an improving global farm economy, while also experiencing
weakening construction, forestry, commercial and consumer sectors primarily as
a result of the U.S. housing downturn. As it maintains its focus on cost and
asset management, the company believes it has successfully entered new markets,
made important acquisitions and expanded its global customer base with advanced
lines of products and services. In addition to achieving strong financial
performance, the company in 2007 returned $1.9 billion to investors through share
repurchases and dividends.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Worldwide net income in 2007
was $1,822 million, or $4.00 per share diluted ($4.05 basic), compared with
$1,694 million, or $3.59 per share diluted ($3.63 basic), in 2006. Income from continuing
operations, which excludes the company’s discontinued health care business (see
Note 2), was also $1,822 million, or $4.00 per share diluted ($4.05 basic), in
2007, compared with $1,453 million, or $3.08 per share diluted ($3.11 basic) in
2006. Net sales and revenues from continuing operations increased 9 percent to
$24,082 million in 2007, compared with $22,148 million in 2006. Net sales of
the Equipment Operations increased 8 percent in 2007 to $21,489 million from
$19,884 million last year. This included a positive effect for currency translation
and price changes of 5 percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada were flat in
2007. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada increased by 27 percent, which
included a positive effect of 7 percent for currency translation. All per share
information reflects a two-for-one stock split effective November 26, 2007
(see Note 1).

Worldwide Equipment
Operations had an operating profit of $2,318 million in 2007, compared with
$1,905 million in 2006. Higher operating profit was primarily due to improved price
realization and higher sales and production volumes. Partially offsetting these
factors were higher selling, administrative and general expenses, increased raw
material costs and higher research and development costs.

The Equipment Operations’
net income was $1,429 million in 2007, compared with $1,089 million in 2006.
The same operating factors mentioned above along with the expense related to
the repurchase of certain outstanding debt securities last year and lower
effective tax rates this year affected these results.

Net income of the company’s
Financial Services operations in 2007 decreased to $364 million, compared with
$584 million in 2006, primarily due to the sale of the health care operations last
year. Income from the Financial Services continuing operations in 2007 was also
$364 million, compared with $344 million in 2006. The increase was primarily a
result of growth in the credit portfolio, partially offset by increased
selling,


administrative and general
expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Additional information is
presented in the following discussion of the credit operations on this page.

Income from discontinued
operations was $241 million in 2006, or $.51 per share diluted ($.52 basic),
primarily due to the sale of the health care operations last year.

The cost of sales to net
sales ratio for 2007 was 75.6 percent, compared with 77.3 percent last year.
The decrease was primarily due to improved price realization and higher sales
and production volumes, partially offset by higher raw material costs.

Finance and interest income,
and interest expense increased this year primarily due to growth in the credit operations
portfolio and higher financing rates. Other income increased this year
primarily from increased service revenues. Research and development costs
increased this year due to increased spending in support of new products and
the effect of currency translation. Selling, administrative and general
expenses increased primarily due to growth and the effect of currency translation.
Other operating expenses were higher primarily as a result of increased cost of
services, higher depreciation expense on operating lease equipment and the
effect of currency translation, partially offset by the expense related to the
repurchase of outstanding notes last year (see Note 3).

The company has several
defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life
insurance plans. The company’s postretirement benefit costs for these plans in 2007
were $415 million, compared with $447 million in 2006. The long-term expected
return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain
of 8.3 percent in 2007 and 8.4 percent in 2006, or $838 million in 2007,
compared with $795 million in 2006. The actual return was a gain of $1,503 million
in 2007, compared with a gain of $1,364 million in 2006. In 2008, the expected
return will be approximately 8.2 percent. The company expects postretirement
benefit costs in 2008 to be lower, compared with 2007, primarily due to lower
amortization of actuarial losses. The company makes any required contributions
to the plan assets under applicable regulations and voluntary contributions
from time to time based on the company’s liquidity and ability to make
tax-deductible contributions. Total company contributions to the plans were $646
million in 2007 and $866 million in 2006, which include direct benefit payments
for unfunded plans. These contributions also included voluntary contributions
to total plan assets of approximately $520 million in 2007 and $760 million in
2006. Total company contributions in 2008 are expected to be approximately $428
million, including voluntary contributions to plan assets of approximately $300
million. See the following discussion of “Critical Accounting Policies” for
more information about postretirement benefit obligations.

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA
RESULTS

The following discussion
relates to operating results by reportable segment and geographic area.
Operating profit is income before external interest expense, certain foreign exchange
gains or losses, income taxes and corporate expenses. However, operating profit
of the credit segment includes the effect of interest expense and foreign
exchange gains or losses.

Worldwide Agricultural Equipment
Operations

The agricultural equipment
segment had an operating profit of $1,443 million in 2007, compared with $882
million in 2006. Net sales increased 18 percent this year due to higher
volumes, the favorable effects of currency translation and improved price realization.
The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher sales and
production volumes, and improved price realization, partially offset by higher
selling, administrative and general expenses attributable in large part to
growth initiatives and currency translation. Also affecting the profit were increased
raw material costs and higher research and development costs.

Worldwide Commercial and Consumer
Equipment Operations

The commercial and consumer
equipment segment had an operating profit of $304 million in 2007, compared
with $221 million in 2006. Net sales increased 12 percent for the year, which
included 9 percent from the LESCO operations. The improved operating profit was
primarily due to higher sales volumes and improved price realization, partially
offset by higher selling, administrative and general expenses largely attributed
to the acquisition.

Worldwide Construction and Forestry
Operations

The construction and
forestry segment had an operating profit of $571 million in 2007, compared with
$802 million in 2006. Net sales decreased 13 percent for the year reflecting
the downturn in U.S. housing starts. The operating profit was lower primarily
due to lower sales and production volumes and higher raw material costs,
partially offset by positive price realization. Last year’s results included expenses
related to the closure of a Canadian forestry equipment facility (see Note 3).

Worldwide Credit Operations

The operating profit of the
credit operations was $548 million in 2007, compared with $520 million in 2006.
The increase in operating profit was primarily due to growth in the credit portfolio,
partially offset by increased selling, administrative and general expenses and
a higher provision for credit losses. Total revenues of the credit operations,
including intercompany revenues, increased 13 percent in 2007, primarily
reflecting the larger portfolio and higher average finance rates. The average balance
of receivables and leases financed was 8 percent higher in 2007, compared with
2006. An increase in average borrowings and higher interest rates in 2007
resulted in a 16 percent increase in interest expense, compared with 2006. The
credit operations’ ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.55 to 1 in 2007, compared
with 1.61 to 1 in 2006.

Equipment Operations in U.S. and
Canada

The equipment operations in
the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $1,539 million in 2007, compared
with $1,445 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to improved price
realization, partially offset by increased selling, administrative and general
expenses, higher raw material costs and higher research and development costs.
Net sales were approximately the same in both years due to lower volumes, offset
by growth from acquisitions and higher price realization. The physical volume
decreased 5 percent excluding acquisitions, compared with 2006.


Equipment Operations outside U.S. and
Canada

The equipment operations
outside the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $779 million in 2007,
compared with $460 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to the
effects of higher shipments and production volumes and improved price realization,
partially offset by increases in selling, administrative and general expenses,
increases in raw material costs and higher research and development costs. Sales
increased from higher volumes, the effect of currency translation and
improvements in price realization. Net sales increased 27 percent in 2007,
while the physical volume increased 17 percent, compared with 2006.

MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK

Company equipment sales are
projected to increase by about 12 percent for the fiscal year and to be up
approximately 25 percent for the first quarter of 2008, compared to the same periods
in 2007. LESCO operations are expected to account for about 2 percentage points
of the sales increase for the year and 3 points in the first quarter. The
company’s net income is forecast to be about $2.1 billion for 2008 and about
$325 million for the first quarter.

Agricultural Equipment.

Driven by
continuing strength in the farm sector, worldwide sales of the company’s
agricultural equipment are expected to increase by about 17 percent for fiscal
year 2008. Included in the segment’s sales forecast is one percentage point for
currency translation and one point related to the acquisition of Ningbo Benye
Tractor & Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd., a Chinese-based tractor
manufacturer purchased by the company in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Worldwide farm conditions
remain quite positive, benefiting from growing economic prosperity, healthy
commodity prices and demand for renewable fuels. Relative to consumption,
global grain stocks such as wheat and corn are continuing to run at or near
thirty-year lows. The company’s sales are expected to receive further support
from the planned introduction of a number of advanced new products globally.

On an industry basis, sales
of farm machinery in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be up 10 to 15 percent
for the year, due in part to a substantial jump in farm cash receipts. Large
tractors and combines are expected to pace the sales improvement, while demand
for cotton pickers is expected to be lower. Industry sales in Western Europe
are forecast to be flat to up slightly for the year with greater increases
expected in Eastern Europe and the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)
countries, including Russia. These latter areas are expected to continue
experiencing strong growth due to rising demand for productive farm machinery.
South American markets are expected to show further improvement in 2008, with
industry sales forecast to increase by 10 to 15 percent. Farm machinery demand
in Brazil, while receiving support from strong commodity prices, may be
tempered by uncertainties over the status of government-backed financing
programs. The company anticipates its sales will be helped by an expanded product
line and additional production capacity associated with the opening of a new
tractor manufacturing facility in Montenegro, Brazil.

Commercial and Consumer Equipment.

The company’s commercial
and consumer equipment sales are projected to be up about 10 percent for the
year, including about 8 percentage points from a full year of LESCO sales.
Segment sales, in addition, are expected to benefit from new products, such as
an expanded line of innovative commercial mowing equipment. Given the nature of
the company’s commercial and consumer businesses, sales tend to have a high
degree of sensitivity to weather patterns and U.S. housing markets.

Construction and Forestry.

U.S. markets
for construction and forestry equipment are forecast to remain under pressure
in 2008 due in large part to a continuing slump in housing starts. Non-residential
construction is expected to remain flat at last year’s relatively strong
levels. Pressure on the U.S. housing market is expected to contribute to lower
worldwide sales of forestry equipment in 2008, though sales in Europe are
forecast to remain at strong levels. Despite this generally weak environment, the
company’s sales are expected to benefit from new products and a return to
factory production levels in closer alignment with retail demand. Last year,
the company made a significant reduction in construction and forestry
inventories, which restrained production. In addition, the company’s sales to
the independent rental channel, which saw a large decline in 2007, are expected
to be flat in the coming year. For 2008, the company’s worldwide sales of
construction and forestry equipment are forecast to be approximately equal to
the prior year.

Credit.

Fiscal year 2008
net income for the company’s credit operations is forecast to be approximately
$375 million, with the improvement driven by growth in the credit portfolio.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

Safe
Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:

Statements
under “Overview,” “Market Conditions and Outlook” and other statements herein
that relate to future operating periods are subject to important risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of
these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while
others could affect all of the company’s businesses.

Forward looking statements
involve certain factors that are subject to change, including for the company’s
agricultural equipment segment the many interrelated factors that affect farmers’
confidence. These factors include worldwide demand for agricultural products,
world grain stocks, weather conditions (including drought in the southeastern
U.S.), soil conditions, harvest yields, prices for commodities and livestock,
crop production expenses, availability of transport for crops, the growth of
non-food uses for some crops (including ethanol and biodiesel production), real
estate values, available acreage for farming, the land ownership policies of
various governments, changes in government farm programs (including those that
may result from farm economic conditions in Brazil), international reaction to
such programs, uncertainties over passage of the U.S. Farm Bill, global trade
agreements, animal diseases and their effects on poultry and beef consumption
and prices (including bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as “mad
cow” disease and avian flu), crop pests and


diseases (including Asian
rust), and the level of farm product exports (including concerns about
genetically modified organisms). The success of the fall harvest and the prices
realized by farmers for their crops especially affect retail sales of
agricultural equipment in the winter.

Factors affecting the outlook
for the company’s commercial and consumer equipment segment include weather
conditions, general economic conditions, customer profitability, consumer confidence,
consumer borrowing patterns, consumer purchasing preferences, housing starts,
infrastructure investment, and spending by municipalities and golf courses.

The number of housing
starts, interest rates and consumer spending patterns are especially important
to sales of the company’s construction equipment. The levels of public and
non-residential construction also impact the results of the company’s
construction and forestry segment. Prices for pulp, lumber and structural panels
are important to sales of forestry equipment.

All of the company’s
businesses and its reported results are affected by general economic conditions
in, and the political and social stability of, the global markets in which the
company operates; production, design and technological difficulties, including
capacity and supply constraints and prices, including for supply commodities
such as steel and rubber; the availability and prices of strategically sourced
materials, components and whole goods; delays or disruptions in the company’s
supply chain due to weather or natural disasters; start-up of new plants and
new products; the success of new product initiatives and customer acceptance of
new products; oil and energy prices and supplies; inflation and deflation
rates, interest rate levels and foreign currency exchange rates; the
availability and cost of freight; trade, monetary and fiscal policies of
various countries, wars and other international conflicts and the threat
thereof; actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other central banks;
actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; actions by environmental
regulatory agencies, including those related to engine emissions and the risk
of global warming; actions by other regulatory bodies; actions by rating
agencies; capital market disruptions; customer borrowing and repayment practices,
the number and size of customer loan delinquencies and defaults, and the
sub-prime credit market crisis; actions of competitors in the various
industries in which the company competes, particularly price discounting;
dealer practices especially as to levels of new and used field inventories;
labor relations; changes to accounting standards; changes in tax rates; the
effects of, or response to, terrorism; and changes in laws and regulations
affecting the sectors in which the company operates. The spread of major
epidemics (including influenza, SARS, fevers and other viruses) also could
affect company results. Company results are also affected by changes in the
level of employee retirement benefits, changes in market values of investment
assets and the level of interest rates, which impact retirement benefit costs,
and significant changes in health care costs. Other factors that could affect
results are changes in company declared dividends, acquisitions and
divestitures of businesses and common stock issuances and repurchases.

The company’s outlook is
based upon assumptions relating to the factors described above, which are
sometimes based upon estimates and data prepared by government agencies. Such
estimates and data are often revised. The company, except as required by law, undertakes
no obligation to update or revise its outlook, whether as a result of new
developments or otherwise. Further information concerning the company and its
businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect the
company’s financial results, is included in other filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Worldwide net income in 2006
was $1,694 million, or $3.59 per share diluted ($3.63 basic), compared with
$1,447 million, or $2.94 per share diluted ($2.97 basic), in 2005. Income from continuing
operations, which excludes the company’s discontinued health care business (see
Note 2), was $1,453 million, or $3.08 per share diluted ($3.11 basic) in 2006,
compared to $1,414 million, or $2.87 per share diluted ($2.90 basic) in 2005. Net
sales and revenues from continuing operations increased 5 percent to $22,148
million in 2006, compared with $21,191 million in 2005. Net sales of the
Equipment Operations increased 2 percent in 2006 to $19,884 million from
$19,401 million in 2005. This included a positive effect for price changes of 3
percent. Equipment net sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 3 percent in
2006. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada increased by 2 percent, which
included a negative effect of 1 percent for currency translation.

Worldwide Equipment
Operations had an operating profit of $1,905 million in 2006, compared with
$1,842 million in 2005. Higher operating profit was primarily due to improved
price realization and lower retirement benefit costs. Partially offsetting these
factors were increased raw material costs, higher selling and administrative
expenses, the impact of lower shipping volumes and increased spending for
research and development.

The Equipment Operations’
net income was $1,089 million in 2006, compared with $1,096 million in 2005.
The same operating factors mentioned above along with the expense related to
the repurchase of certain outstanding debt securities and higher effective tax
rates in 2006 affected these results.

Net income of the company’s
Financial Services operations in 2006 increased to $584 million, compared with $345
million in 2005, primarily due to the sale of the health care operations.
Income from the Financial Services continuing operations in 2006 was $344
million, compared with $312 million in 2005. The increase was primarily a
result of growth in the credit portfolio, partially offset by a higher
provision for credit losses. Additional information is presented in the following
discussion of the credit operations.

Income from discontinued
operations was $241 million in 2006, or $.51 per share diluted ($.52 basic),
compared with $33 million, or $.07 per share diluted ($.07 basic), in 2005. The
increase was primarily due to the previously mentioned sale of the health care
operations.


The cost of sales to net
sales ratio for 2006 was 77.3 percent, compared with 78.2 percent in 2005. The
decrease was primarily due to improved price realization and lower retirement
benefit costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs and lower shipping
volumes.

Finance and interest income,
and interest expense increased in 2006 primarily due to growth in the credit
operations portfolio and higher financing rates. Other income increased in 2006
primarily due to investment income from marketable securities, insurance
premiums for extended warranties, crop insurance commissions and service
income. Research and development costs increased in 2006 due to a large number of
new products. Selling, administrative and general expenses increased primarily
due to growth, share-based compensation expense and the provision for credit
losses. Other operating expenses were higher primarily as a result of the
expense related to the repurchase of outstanding notes (see Note 3), extended warranty
claims, depreciation related to a higher level of equipment on operating
leases, and service expenses.

The company has several
defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life
insurance plans. The company’s postretirement benefit costs for these plans in 2006
were $447 million, compared with $538 million in 2005. The long-term expected
return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain
of 8.4 percent in 2006 and 8.5 percent in 2005, or $795 million in 2006,
compared with $744 million in 2005. The actual return was a gain of $1,364 million
in 2006, compared with a gain of $1,057 million in 2005. Total company
contributions to the plans were $866 million in 2006 and $859 million in 2005,
which include direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. These contributions
also included voluntary contributions to the U.S. plan assets of $739 million in
2006 and $556 million in 2005.

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA
RESULTS

Worldwide Agricultural Equipment
Operations

The agricultural equipment
segment had an operating profit of $882 million in 2006, compared with $970
million in 2005. Net sales decreased 3 percent in 2006 due to lower shipments, partially
offset by improved price realization. The decrease in operating profit was
primarily due to the impact of lower shipments and production volumes, as well
as higher selling and administrative expenses and research and development
costs. Partially offsetting these factors were improved price realization and
lower retirement benefit costs.

Worldwide Commercial and Consumer
Equipment Operations

The commercial and consumer
equipment segment had an operating profit of $221 million in 2006, compared
with $183 million in 2005. Net sales increased 8 percent in 2006, primarily due
to higher sales in the landscapes operations. The improved operating profit was
primarily due to the improved profitability of the landscapes operations and
lower retirement benefit costs.

Worldwide Construction and Forestry
Operations

The construction and
forestry segment had an operating profit of $802 million in 2006, compared with
$689 million in 2005. Net sales increased 10 percent in 2006, reflecting strong
activity at the retail level. The operating profit improvement was primarily
due to improved price realization, margin on increased shipments and
efficiencies from stronger production volumes. These factors were partially
offset by higher material costs, expenses to close a facility in Canada (see
Note 3) and higher research and development costs.

Worldwide Credit Operations

The operating profit of the
credit operations was $520 million in 2006, compared with $491 million in 2005.
The increase in operating profit was primarily due to growth in the credit portfolio,
partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and lower financing
spreads. Total revenues of the credit operations, including intercompany
revenues, increased 24 percent in 2006, primarily reflecting the larger
portfolio and higher average finance rates. The average balance of receivables
and leases financed was 15 percent higher in 2006, compared with 2005. An
increase in average borrowings and higher interest rates in 2006 resulted in a
44 percent increase in interest expense, compared with 2005. The larger average
portfolio financed on the balance sheet and the higher average borrowings were
primarily due to an increase in securitizations of retail notes accounted for
as secured borrowings rather than sales of receivables. The credit operations’
ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.61 to 1 in 2006, compared with 1.86 to
1 in 2005.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The discussion of capital
resources and liquidity has been organized to review separately, where appropriate,
the company’s consolidated totals, Equipment Operations and Financial Services
operations.

CONSOLIDATED

Positive cash flows from
consolidated operating activities in 2007 were $2,759 million. This resulted
primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash provisions, an increase in
accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in trade receivables, which
were partially offset by an increase in inventories and a decrease in
retirement benefit accruals. Cash outflows from investing activities were
$1,933 million in 2007, primarily due to the cost of financing receivables and
equipment on operating leases exceeding collections of financing receivables
and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $1,160 million,
purchases of property and equipment of $1,023 million and acquisitions of
businesses for $189 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from
maturities and sales of marketable securities exceeding the cost of marketable
securities purchased by $207 million, and the proceeds from sales of financing
receivables of $141 million. Cash outflows from financing activities were $281
million in 2007, primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $1,518 million
and dividends paid of $387 million, which were partially offset by an increase in
borrowings of $1,247 million, proceeds from issuance of


common stock of $286 million
(resulting from the exercise of stock options) and excess tax benefits from
share-based compensation of $102 million. Cash and cash equivalents also increased
$591 million during 2007.

Over the last three years,
operating activities have provided an aggregate of $4,949 million in cash. In
addition, increases in borrowings were $6,185 million, proceeds from issuance
of common stock were $767 million and the proceeds from sales of businesses
were $567 million. The aggregate amount of these cash flows was used mainly to
fund receivable and lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections and the proceeds
from sales of equipment on operating leases by $4,797 million, repurchase
common stock for $3,736 million, fund purchases of property and equipment of
$2,301 million, purchase marketable securities, which exceeded proceeds from maturities
and sales of marketable securities by $1,564 million, pay dividends to
stockholders of $1,025 million and acquire businesses for $415 million. Cash
and cash equivalents also decreased $903 million over the three-year period.

Sources of liquidity for the
company include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds from
operations, the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, the securitization of
retail notes and committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit.

Because of the multiple
funding sources that have been and continue to be available, the company expects
to have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its funding needs. The company’s
commercial paper outstanding at October 31, 2007 and 2006 was
approximately $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, while the total cash
and cash equivalents and marketable securities position was $3.9 billion and
$3.5 billion, respectively. The company has for many years accessed diverse
funding sources, including short-term and long-term unsecured debt capital
markets globally, as well as public and private securitization markets in the
U.S. and Canada.

Lines of Credit.

The company also has access
to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines
are available to both Deere & Company and John Deere Capital
Corporation (Capital Corporation). Worldwide lines of credit totaled $3,894
million at October 31, 2007, $904 million of which were unused. For the
purpose of computing unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank
borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings,
were considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines
at October 31, 2007 was a long-term credit facility agreement of $3.75
billion, expiring in February 2012. The credit agreement requires the Capital
Corporation to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at
not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt,
excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt
and stockholder’s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)) at not more than 9.5 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreement
also requires the Equipment Operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to
total capital (total debt and stockholders’ equity excluding accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end of each fiscal
quarter according to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. in
effect at October 31, 2006. Under this provision, the company’s excess
equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at October 31,
2007 was $6,661 million. Alternatively under this provision, the Equipment
Operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of $12,370 million at October 31,
2007. All of these requirements of the credit agreement have been met during
the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.

Debt Ratings.

To access public debt
capital markets, the company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term
and long-term credit ratings to the company’s securities as an indicator of
credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a
recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell or hold company securities. A
credit rating agency may change or withdraw company ratings based on its
assessment of the company’s current and future ability to meet interest and principal
repayment obligations. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently.
Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced
access to debt capital markets. The senior long-term and short-term debt
ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured company securities by the
rating agencies engaged by the company are as follows:

Trade accounts and notes
receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. Trade
receivables increased by $17 million in 2007. The ratio of trade accounts and
notes receivable at October 31 to fiscal year net sales was 14 percent in
2007, compared with 15 percent in 2006. Total worldwide agricultural equipment
trade receivables increased $220 million, commercial and consumer equipment receivables
decreased $52 million and construction and forestry receivables decreased $151
million. The collection period for trade receivables averages less than 12
months. The percentage of trade receivables outstanding for a period exceeding
12 months was 3 percent at both October 31, 2007 and 2006.

Stockholders’ equity was
$7,156 million at October 31, 2007, compared with $7,491 million at October 31,
2006. The decrease of $335 million resulted primarily from an increase in treasury
stock of $1,342 million, an incremental charge to accumulated other
comprehensive income of $1,091 million resulting from the adoption of FASB
Statement No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans (see Note 5) and dividends declared of $409 million. These
items were partially offset by net income of $1,822 million, an increase in
common stock of $574 million and an increase in the cumulative translation
adjustment of $329 million. Common stock increased primarily due to the exercise
of stock options and a $268 million transfer from retained earnings for the par
value relating to a stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend
(see Note 23).


The cash flows from
discontinued operations included in the consolidated cash flows were not
material except for the cash inflow from the sale of the health care operations
(net of cash sold) of approximately $440 million included in the proceeds from
sales of businesses in 2006.

EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS

The company’s equipment
businesses are capital intensive and are subject to seasonal variations in
financing requirements for inventories and certain receivables from dealers.
The Equipment Operations sell most of their trade receivables to the company’s credit
operations. As a result, there are relatively small seasonal variations in the
financing requirements of the Equipment Operations. To the extent necessary,
funds provided from operations are supplemented by external financing sources.

Cash provided by operating
activities of the Equipment Operations during 2007, including intercompany cash
flows, was $2,689 million primarily due to net income adjusted for non-cash
provisions and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially
offset by a decrease in retirement benefit accruals.

Over the last three years,
these operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, have provided an
aggregate of $5,661 million in cash.

Trade receivables held by
the Equipment Operations increased by $42 million during 2007. The Equipment Operations
sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to the credit operations
(see previous consolidated discussion).

Inventories increased by
$380 million in 2007. Most of these inventories are valued on the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. The ratios of inventories on a first-in, first-out
(FIFO) basis (see Note 15), which approximates current cost, to fiscal year
cost of sales were 22 percent and 20 percent at October 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Total interest-bearing debt
of the Equipment Operations was $2,103 million at the end of 2007, compared
with $2,252 million at the end of 2006 and $3,101 million at the end of 2005. The
ratio of total debt to total capital (total interest-bearing debt and stockholders’
equity) at the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 23 percent, 23 percent and 31
percent, respectively.

Purchases of property and
equipment for the Equipment Operations in 2007 were $557 million, compared with
$493 million in 2006. Capital expenditures in 2008 are estimated to be
approximately $600 million to $700 million.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

The Financial Services’
credit operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds
to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Their primary sources of
funds for this purpose are a combination of commercial paper, term debt,
securitization of retail notes and equity capital.

Cash flows from the company’s
Financial Services operating activities, including intercompany cash flows,
were $851 million in 2007. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $900
million in 2007, representing primarily a $1,463 million increase in external
borrowings, partially offset by the payment of $588 million of dividends to
Deere & Company. The cash provided by operating and financing
activities was used primarily to increase receivables and leases. Cash used by investing
activities totaled $1,720 million in 2007, primarily due to the cost of
financing receivables and equipment on operating leases exceeding collections
of financing receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating
leases by $1,487 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $465
million. Cash and cash equivalents also increased $48 million.

Over the last three years,
the Financial Services operating activities, including intercompany cash flows,
have provided $2,229 million in cash. In addition, an increase in borrowings of
$6,064 million and proceeds from sales of financing receivables of $502 million
provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used mainly to fund receivable
and lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections and the proceeds from sales
of equipment on operating leases by $7,127 million, pay dividends to Deere &
Company of $862 million and fund purchases of property and equipment of $784
million. Cash and cash equivalents also decreased $7 million over the
three-year period.

Receivables and leases
increased by $1,741 million in 2007, compared with 2006. Acquisition volumes of
receivables and leases increased 1 percent in 2007, compared with 2006. The
volumes of financing leases, revolving charge accounts, retail notes and
operating leases increased approximately 15 percent, 8 percent, 7 percent and 2
percent, while wholesale notes, operating loans and trade receivables were 9
percent, 4 percent and 1 percent lower, respectively. At October 31, 2007
and 2006, net receivables and leases administered, which include receivables
previously sold but still administered, were $22,543 million and $21,547 million,
respectively.

Total external
interest-bearing debt of the credit operations was $19,665 million at the end
of 2007, compared with $17,453 million at the end of 2006 and $15,522 million
at the end of 2005. Included in this debt are secured borrowings of $2,344
million at the end of 2007, $2,403 million at the end of 2006 and $1,474
million at the end of 2005. Total external borrowings have increased generally
corresponding with the level of the receivable and lease portfolio, the level
of cash and cash equivalents and the change in payables owed to the Equipment
Operations. The credit subsidiaries’ ratio of total interest-bearing debt to
total stockholder’s equity was 8.2 to 1 at the end of 2007, 7.1 to 1 at the end
of 2006 and 7.2 to 1 at the end of 2005.

The credit operations have
utilized a revolving multi-bank conduit facility to securitize floating rate
retail notes that were structured as either sales or secured borrowings (see
Note 12). In September 2007, the company amended the facility and simultaneously
repurchased $264 million of retail notes previously sold into the facility and
elected not to renew the facility for any future securitizations. At October 31,
2007, $657 million of securitized retail notes remained in the facility
relating only to secured borrowings, which are recorded on the balance sheet. These
secured borrowings will be liquidated as payments on the retail notes are
collected.

During 2007, the credit
operations issued $4,284 million and retired $3,129 million of long-term
borrowings, which were primarily medium-term notes.


Purchases of property and
equipment for Financial Services in 2007 were $465 million, compared with $273
million in 2006, primarily related to investments in wind energy generation. Capital
expenditures for 2008 are estimated to be approximately $550 million, also
primarily related to investments in wind energy generation.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The company’s credit
operations offer crop insurance products through a managing general agency
agreement (Agreement) with an insurance company (Insurance Carrier) rated “Excellent”
by A.M. Best Company. The credit operations have guaranteed certain
obligations under the Agreement, including the obligation to pay the Insurance
Carrier for any uncollected premiums. At October 31, 2007, the maximum exposure
for uncollected premiums was approximately $57 million. Substantially all of
the crop insurance risk under the Agreement has been mitigated by a syndicate
of private reinsurance companies. In the event of a widespread catastrophic crop
failure throughout the U.S. and the default of all the reinsurance companies on
their obligations, the company would be required to reimburse the Insurance
Carrier approximately $489 million at October 31, 2007. The company
believes the likelihood of this event is substantially remote.

At October 31, 2007,
the company had approximately $190 million of guarantees issued primarily to
banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the retail
financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any
required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the
equipment collateralizing the receivables. The maximum remaining term of the
receivables guaranteed at October 31, 2007 was approximately eight years.

Prior to 2005, the company’s
credit operations periodically sold retail notes to special purpose entities
(SPEs) in securitization transactions. The credit operations have used these
SPEs in a manner consistent with conventional practices in the securitization
industry to isolate the retail notes for the benefit of securitization
investors. The use of the SPEs has enabled these operations to access the
historically liquid and efficient securitization markets for the sales of these
types of financial assets. The amounts of funding the company chooses to obtain
from securitizations reflect such factors as capital market accessibility,
relative costs of funding sources and assets available for securitization. The
company’s total exposure to recourse provisions related to securitized retail
notes, which were sold in prior periods, was $20 million and the total assets
held by the SPEs related to these securitizations were $120 million at October 31,
2007.

AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The payment schedule for the
company’s contractual obligations at October 31, 2007 in millions of
dollars is as follows:

*

Principal payments.

**

Notes payable of $2,344
  million classified as short-term on the balance sheet related to the
  securitization of retail notes are included in this table based on the
  expected payment schedule (see Note 18).

For additional information
regarding pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations,
short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings and lease obligations, see Notes 5,
18, 20 and 21, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of the
company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a
significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies below
are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the
company’s financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments. The company’s other accounting policies are described in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sales
Incentives

At the time a sale to a
dealer is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales
incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when the
dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on historical
data, announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and settlement
volumes. The final cost of these programs and the amount of accrual required
for a specific sale is fully determined when the dealer sells the equipment to
the retail customer. This is due to numerous programs available at any particular
time and new programs that may be announced after the company records the sale.
Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these estimates, which are
reviewed quarterly.

The sales incentive accruals
at October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $711 million, $629 million and
$592 million, respectively. The increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily due
to the increases in sales.


The estimation of the sales
incentive accrual is impacted by many assumptions. One of the key assumptions
is the historical percentage of sales incentive costs to settlements from dealers.
Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by approximately plus
or minus .7 percent, compared to the average sales incentive costs to
settlements percentage during that period. Holding other assumptions constant,
if this cost experience percentage were to increase or decrease .7 percent, the
sales incentive accrual at October 31, 2007 would increase or decrease by
approximately $40 million.

Product
Warranties

At the time a sale to a
dealer is recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs.
The company generally determines its total warranty liability by applying historical
claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold
and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The
historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims
costs and consideration of current quality developments. Variances in claims
experience and the type of warranty programs affect these estimates, which are
reviewed quarterly.

The product warranty
accruals at October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $549 million, $507
million and $535 million, respectively. The increase in 2007, compared to 2006,
was primarily due to an increase in sales volume. The decrease in 2006 was due
to a higher level of special warranty programs in 2005.

Estimates used to determine
the product warranty accruals are significantly affected by the historical
percentage of warranty claims costs to sales. Over the last five fiscal years,
this loss experience percent has varied by approximately plus or minus .05
percent, compared to the average warranty costs to sales percentage during that
period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience
percentage were to increase or decrease .05 percent, the warranty accrual at October 31,
2007 would increase or decrease by approximately $15 million.

Postretirement
Benefit Obligations

Pension obligations and
other postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) obligations are based on various
assumptions used by the company’s actuaries in calculating these amounts. These
assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected
return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement rates, mortality
rates and other factors. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and
changes in assumptions affect future expenses and obligations.

The pension assets, net of
pension liabilities, recognized on the balance sheet at October 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005 were $1,467 million, $1,945 million and $1,986 million, respectively.
The OPEB liabilities on these same dates were $3,065 million, $1,985 million
and $2,455 million, respectively. The decrease in the pension net assets and
the increase in the OPEB liabilities on the balance sheet in 2007 were
primarily due to the adoption in 2007 of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans (see Note 5). This standard required unrecognized
gains or losses relating to postretirement benefit obligations to be recorded
on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding charge or credit to
stockholders’ equity.

The effect of hypothetical
changes to selected assumptions on the company’s major U. S. retirement benefit
plans would be as follows in millions of dollars:

*

Projected benefit
  obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit
  obligation (APBO) for OPEB plans.

**

Pretax impact on service
  cost, interest cost and amortization of gains or losses.

Allowance
for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit
losses represents an estimate of the losses expected from the company’s
receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many quantitative
and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience by product
category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and
credit risk quality. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly.
Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes
to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses.

The total allowance for credit
losses at October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $236 million, $217 million
and $194 million, respectively. The increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily due
to growth in the receivable portfolio.

The assumptions used in
evaluating the company’s exposure to credit losses involve estimates and
significant judgment. The historical loss experience on the receivable portfolio
represents one of the key assumptions involved in determining the allowance for
credit losses. Over the last five fiscal years, the average loss experience has
fluctuated between 2 basis points and 18 basis points in any given fiscal year
over the applicable prior period. Holding other estimates constant, a 5 basis
point increase or decrease in estimated loss experience on the receivable portfolio
would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $10 million to the
allowance for credit losses at October 31, 2007.


Operating
Lease Residual Values

The carrying value of
equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the
equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the
lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party,
in which case the company may record a gain or a loss for the difference
between the estimated residual value and the sales price. The residual values
are dependent on current economic conditions and are reviewed quarterly.
Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation
expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases.

The total operating lease
residual values at October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $1,072 million,
$917 million and $812 million, respectively. The increases in 2007 and 2006 were
primarily due to the higher levels of operating leases.

Estimates used in
determining end of lease market values for equipment on operating leases
significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. If future
market values for this equipment were to decrease 5 percent from the company’s
present estimates, the total impact would be to increase the company’s annual
depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately $18 million.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK INFORMATION

The company is naturally
exposed to various interest rate and foreign currency risks. As a result, the
company enters into derivative transactions to manage certain of these
exposures that arise in the normal course of business and not for the purpose
of creating speculative positions or trading. The company’s credit operations
manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to
their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to
interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable
financing opportunities. Accordingly, from time to time, these operations enter
into interest rate swap agreements to manage their interest rate exposure. The
company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic
operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than
the local currencies. The company has entered into agreements related to the management
of these currency transaction risks. The credit risk under these interest rate
and foreign currency agreements is not considered to be significant.

Interest
Rate Risk

Quarterly, the company uses
a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of its financial
instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest rates.
The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows. Cash
flows for financing receivables are discounted at the current prevailing rate
for each receivable portfolio. Cash flows for marketable securities are
primarily discounted at the treasury yield curve. Cash flows for borrowings are
discounted at the treasury yield curve plus a market credit spread for
similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for securitized borrowings are discounted
at the industrial composite bond curve for similarly rated borrowers. Cash
flows for interest rate swaps are projected and discounted using forecasted
rates from the swap yield curve at the repricing dates. The net loss in these
financial instruments’ fair values which would be caused by increasing the
interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at October 31, 2007 and
2006 would have been approximately $22 million and $14 million, respectively.

Foreign
Currency Risk

In the Equipment Operations,
it is the company’s practice to hedge significant currency exposures. Worldwide
foreign currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the Equipment
Operations’ anticipated and committed foreign currency cash inflows and
outflows for the next twelve months and the foreign currency derivatives at
year end, the company estimates that a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the
U.S. dollar relative to other currencies through 2008 would decrease the 2008
expected net cash inflows by $77 million. At last year end, a hypothetical 10
percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar under similar assumptions and
calculations indicated a potential $32 million adverse effect on the 2007 net
cash inflows.

In the Financial Services
operations, the company’s policy is to hedge the foreign currency risk if the
currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable portfolio.
As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the value of the U.S.
dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a material
effect on the Financial Services cash flows.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following are
significant accounting policies in addition to those included in other notes to
the consolidated financial statements.

Principles
of Consolidation

The consolidated financial
statements represent the consolidation of all companies in which Deere &
Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs)
related to the securitization of financing receivables for secured borrowings, and
a supplier operation are consolidated since the company is the primary
beneficiary. Deere & Company records its investment in each unconsolidated
affiliated company (generally 20 to 50 percent ownership) at its related equity
in the net assets of such affiliate. Other investments (less than 20 percent ownership)
are recorded at cost. Consolidated retained earnings at October 31, 2007
include undistributed earnings of the unconsolidated affiliates of $75 million.
Dividends from unconsolidated affiliates were $13 million in 2007, $3 million in
2006 and $2 million in 2005 (see Note 8).

Reclassification

Certain items previously
reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to
conform to the 2007 financial statement presentation. In particular, unamortized
restricted stock compensation previously presented separately has been eliminated
against common stock as a result of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123
(revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, in 2006.

Structure
of Operations

Certain information in the
notes and related commentary are presented in a format which includes data
grouped as follows:

Equipment Operations

— Includes the company’s agricultural equipment, commercial and
consumer equipment and construction and forestry operations with Financial
Services reflected on the equity basis except for the health care operations, which
were disposed of in February 2006 and are reported on a discontinued basis (see
Note 2).

Financial Services

— Includes the company’s credit and certain miscellaneous service
operations with the health care operations reported on a discontinued basis.

Consolidated

— Represents the consolidation of the Equipment Operations and
Financial Services with the health care operations reported on a discontinued
basis. References to “Deere & Company” or “the company” refer to the entire
enterprise.

Stock Split
in Form of Dividend

On November 14, 2007, a
special meeting of stockholders was held authorizing a two-for-one stock split
effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to holders of record on
November 26, 2007, distributed on December 3, 2007. All share and per share
data (except par value) have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock
split for all periods presented. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon
exercise of outstanding stock options, vesting of other stock awards, and the
number of shares reserved for issuance under various employee benefit plans
were proportionately increased in accordance with terms of the respective plans
(see Notes 23 and 24).

Use of
Estimates in Financial Statements

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

Sales of equipment and
service parts are recorded when the sales price is determinable, and title and
all risk of ownership are transferred to independent parties based on the sales
agreements in effect. In the U.S. and most international locations, this transfer
occurs primarily when goods are shipped. In Canada and some other international
locations, certain goods are shipped to dealers on a consignment basis under
which title and risk of ownership are not transferred to the dealer.
Accordingly, in these locations, sales are not recorded until a retail customer
has purchased the goods. In all cases, when a sale is recorded by the company,
no significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchaser’s obligation to
pay. No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Service parts returns are
estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized. The company makes
appropriate provisions based on experience for costs such as doubtful receivables,
sales incentives and product warranty.

Financing revenue is
recorded over the lives of related receivables using the interest method.
Deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are recognized as a
reduction in finance revenue over the expected lives of the receivables using
the interest method. Income from operating leases is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms.

Sales
Incentives

At the time a sale is
recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs
for allowances and financing programs that will be due when a dealer sells the
equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on historical data,
announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and settlement volumes.

Product
Warranties

At the time a sale is
recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs. These
costs are usually estimated based on historical warranty claims (see Note 22).

Sales Taxes

The company collects and
remits taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both
imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the company
and its customers. These taxes may include sales, use, value-added and some
excise taxes. The company reports the collection of these taxes on a net basis
(excluded from revenues).

Securitization
of Receivables

Certain financing
receivables are periodically transferred to SPEs in securitization transactions
(see Note 12). For securitizations that qualify as collateral for secured
borrowings, no gains or losses are recognized at the time of securitization.
These receivables remain on the balance sheet and are classified as “Restricted
financing receivables - net.” The company recognizes finance income over the
lives of these receivables using the interest method. For any securitizations
that qualify as sales of receivables, the gains or losses from the sales are
recognized in the period of


sale based on the relative
fair value of the portion sold and the portion allocated to interests that
continue to be held by the company. These interests are recorded at fair value
estimated by discounting future cash flows. Changes in these fair values are
recorded after-tax in other comprehensive income in unrealized gain or loss on
investments. Other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in net income.

Shipping
and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs
related to the sales of the company’s equipment are included in cost of sales.

Advertising
Costs

Advertising costs are
charged to expense as incurred. This expense was $169 million in 2007, $165
million in 2006 and $157 million in 2005.

Depreciation
and Amortization

Property and equipment,
capitalized software and other intangible assets are depreciated over their
estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. Equipment on
operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the
straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised
products, increased capacity and the replacement or major renewal of
significant items are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and
minor renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred.

Receivables
and Allowances

All financing and trade receivables
are reported on the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any
charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts, and any
deferred fees or costs on originated financing receivables. Allowances for
credit losses and doubtful accounts are maintained in amounts considered to be
appropriate in relation to the receivables outstanding based on collection
experience, economic conditions and credit risk quality.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The company evaluates the
carrying value of long-lived assets (including property and equipment, goodwill
and other intangible assets) when events and circumstances warrant such a
review. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested
for impairment annually. Goodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by
reporting units, which consist primarily of the operating segments. The
goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created
the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of
each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of
the goodwill or long-lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized
based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the
asset.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

It is the company’s policy
that derivative transactions are executed only to manage exposures arising in
the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative
positions or trading. The company’s credit operations manage the relationship
of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease
portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign
currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities.
The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and
domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies
other than the local currencies.

All derivatives are recorded
at fair value on the balance sheet. Each derivative is designated as either a
cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge, or remains undesignated. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges
are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the income
statement when the effects of the item being hedged are recognized in the
income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated
and effective as fair value hedges are recognized currently in net income. This
is offset to the extent the hedge was effective by the fair value changes
related to the risk being hedged on the hedged item. Changes in the fair value
of undesignated hedges are recognized currently in the income statement. All
ineffective changes in derivative fair values are recognized currently in net
income.

All designated hedges are
formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as the
risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis the hedging
instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness, when applicable. If and when a
derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, or the
underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the derivative
is terminated, the hedge accounting discussed above is discontinued. Any past
or future changes in the derivative’s fair value that will not be effective as
an offset to the income effects of the item being hedged are recognized
currently in the income statement (see Note 27).

Foreign
Currency Translation

The functional currencies
for most of the company’s foreign operations are their respective local
currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into
U.S. dollars at the end of the period exchange rates, and the revenues and
expenses are translated at weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or
losses from these translations are included in other comprehensive income,
which is part of stockholders’ equity. Gains or losses from transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary
involved and foreign exchange forward contracts and options are included in net
income or other comprehensive income as appropriate. The total foreign exchange
pretax net gain (loss) for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $(28) million, $2 million
and $(7) million, respectively.

New
Accounting Standards Adopted

In the first quarter of
2007, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections. This Statement requires voluntary changes in accounting principles
to be recorded retrospectively for prior periods presented rather than a
cumulative adjustment in the current period. This treatment would also be
required for new accounting pronouncements if there are no specific transition
provisions. The accounting for changes in estimates in the current period and
the accounting for errors as restatements of prior periods have not changed. In
the first quarter of 2007, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 155,
Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments. This Statement primarily
resolves certain issues addressed in the implementation of


FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, concerning
beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. In the first quarter of
2007, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of
Financial Assets. This Statement clarifies the criteria for recognizing
servicing assets and liabilities, requires these items to be initially measured
at fair value and permits subsequent measurements on either an amortization or
fair value basis. The adoption of these Statements did not have a material
effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

At October 31, 2007, the
company adopted FASB Statement No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (see Note 5). This Statement
requires retirement benefit accruals or prepaid benefit costs on the balance
sheet to be adjusted to the difference between the benefit obligations and the
plan assets at fair value. The offset to the adjustment is recorded directly in
stockholders’ equity net of tax. The amount recorded in stockholders’ equity represents
the after-tax unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and unamortized prior
service costs, which have previously been disclosed in the notes to the annual
consolidated financial statements. This Statement also requires all benefit
obligations and plan assets to be measured at fiscal year end. The effective
date for the year-end measurement date is fiscal year 2009. Prospective
application is required. At October 31, 2007, the effect of adopting this
Statement decreased assets by $9 million, increased liabilities by $1,082
million and decreased stockholders’ equity by $1,091 million after-tax. The
company did not violate any credit agreement financial covenants as a result of
adopting this new standard.

New
Accounting Standards to be Adopted

In June 2006, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This
Interpretation clarifies that the recognition for uncertain tax positions
should be based on a more-likely-than-not threshold that the tax position will
be sustained upon audit. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of
benefit that has a greater than 50 percent probability of being realized upon
settlement. The standard will be adopted at the beginning of fiscal year 2008
with the cumulative effect reported as an adjustment to beginning retained
earnings as required. The cumulative effect of adoption will increase assets by
approximately $160 million, increase liabilities by approximately $210 million
and decrease retained earnings by approximately $50 million.

In September 2006, the FASB
issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair
value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. These methods will
apply to other accounting standards that use fair value measurements and may
change the application of certain measurements used in current practice. The
effective date is the beginning of fiscal year 2009. The adoption is not
expected to have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
statements.

In February 2007, the FASB
issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities. This Statement permits entities to measure most financial
instruments at fair value if desired. It may be applied on a contract by contract
basis and is irrevocable once applied to those contracts. The standard may be
applied at the time of adoption for existing eligible items, or at initial
recognition of eligible items. After election of this option, changes in fair
value are reported in earnings. The items measured at fair value must be shown
separately on the balance sheet. The effective date is the beginning of fiscal
year 2009. The cumulative effect of adoption would be reported as an adjustment
to beginning retained earnings. The company has currently not determined the
potential effect on the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB
issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, and Statement
No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.
Statement No. 141 (revised 2007) requires an acquirer to measure the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date, with
goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. This
standard also requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and
liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies and research and
development. Statement No. 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a
subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
statements. Consolidated net income should include the net income for both the
parent and the noncontrolling interest with disclosure of both amounts on the
consolidated statement of income. The calculation of earnings per share will
continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. The
effective date for both Statements is the beginning of fiscal year 2010. The
company has currently not determined the potential effects on the consolidated
financial statements.

Share-Based
Compensation

In the first quarter of
2006, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based
Payment, (see Note 24). In 2005 and prior years, the company used the intrinsic
value method of accounting for its plans in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. No compensation expense for stock
options was recognized under this method since the options’ exercise prices
were not less than the market prices of the stock at the dates the options were
awarded. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in earnings was
related to restricted stock awards. For disclosure purposes under FASB
Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, a binomial lattice
option pricing model was used in 2005 to calculate the “fair value” of stock
options. Based on this model, the weighted-average fair value of stock options
awarded during 2005 was $9.99 on an after stock split basis. For the pro-forma
disclosure information, the compensation cost of the stock options that vest
from one to three years was recognized on a straight-line basis over the
three-year vesting period.

Pro forma net income and net
income per share, as if the fair value method in FASB Statement No. 123 had
been used


for stock-based
compensation, and the assumptions used were as follows with dollars in millions
except per share amounts:

*

Adjusted for
  two-for-one stock split.

Weighted-averages

Acquisitions

In May 2007, the company
acquired LESCO, Inc. (LESCO) for a cost of approximately $150 million with
preliminary values of approximately $92 million of goodwill, which is not tax
deductible, and $34 million of other identifiable intangible assets. The other
intangible assets had a weighted-average amortization period of 13 years.
LESCO, based in Cleveland, Ohio, is a leading supplier of consumable lawn care,
landscape, golf course and pest control products. The preliminary values
assigned to the other major assets and liabilities related to the acquisition
were $18 million of receivables, $167 million of inventory, $18 million of
property and equipment, $31 million of other assets and $210 million of
liabilities. LESCO is the primary beneficiary of its major supplier, which is a
VIE. The VIE produces blended fertilizer and other lawn care products for LESCO
and has been consolidated with LESCO’s assets and liabilities shown above. The
assets of the VIE that were consolidated, less the intercompany receivables
from LESCO that were eliminated in consolidation, totaled approximately $60
million (primarily inventory) at time of acquisition and at fiscal year end
2007. The creditors of the VIE do not have recourse to the general credit of
LESCO. LESCO has been included as part of the company’s commercial and consumer
equipment segment.

In August, 2007, the company
acquired Ningbo Benye Tractor & Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Ningbo
Benye) for a cost of approximately $85 million, including insignificant
goodwill and a preliminary value of approximately $40 million of identifiable
intangible assets with a weighted-average amortization period of 24 years. This
business, which is located in Ningbo, China, builds tractors mainly in the 20
to 50 horsepower range and is the largest tractor manufacturer in southern
China. The preliminary values assigned to the other major assets and
liabilities related to the acquisition were $15 million of receivables, $22
million of inventory, $20 million of property and equipment and $12 million of
liabilities. Ningbo Benye has been included as part of the company’s
agricultural equipment segment.

The goodwill generated in
these acquisitions was the result of the future cash flows and related fair
values of the entity acquired exceeding the fair values of its identifiable
assets and liabilities. Certain long-lived assets including other intangibles
are still being evaluated. The results of these operations have been included
in the company’s financial statements since the date of the acquisition. The
pro forma results of operations as if the acquisition had occurred at the
beginning of the fiscal year would not differ significantly from the reported
results.

Certain adjustments were
also made in 2007 to the estimated fair values of assets recorded for
acquisitions made in 2006 based on final evaluations (see Note 17).

2.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In February 2006, the
company sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, John Deere Health Care, Inc. (health
care operations), to UnitedHealthcare for $512 million and recognized a gain on
the sale of $356 million pretax, or $223 million after-tax ($.47 per share
diluted, $.48 per share basic). These operations and the gain on the sale have
been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial
statements for all periods presented.

The revenue from
discontinued operations on the statement of consolidated income in 2006 and
2005 was $621 million and $740 million, and the income before income taxes was
$384 million and $49 million, respectively. The fees paid from the continuing
operations to the discontinued health care operations for administering health
care claims in 2006 and 2005 were $7 million and $21 million, respectively. The
company will continue to pay fees to UnitedHealthcare to administer health
claims. The employee termination benefit expense related to the discontinued
operations in 2006 was $8 million, with payments of $4 million in 2006 and $1
million in 2007, and a remaining liability at October 31, 2007 of $3 million.
This expense was recorded in “Income from Discontinued Operations.”

3. SPECIAL
ITEMS

Restructuring

In January 2006, the company
decided to close its forestry manufacturing facility in Woodstock, Ontario,
Canada and consolidate the manufacturing into the company’s existing Davenport
and Dubuque, Iowa facilities. This restructuring is intended to reduce costs
and further improve product delivery times. The facility was included in the
construction and forestry segment.

In 2006, the total expense recognized in
costs of sales related to the closure was $44 million pretax, which included
$21 million for pension and other postretirement benefits; $10 million for
employee termination benefits; $6 million for impairments and write-downs of
property, equipment and inventory; $5 million for relocation of production and
$2 million for other expenses. At October 31, 2006, there were no remaining significant
liabilities or expenses related to the restructuring. The pretax cash
expenditures associated with this closure were approximately $35 million. The
annual increase in earnings and cash flows in 2007 due to this restructuring
are estimated to be $10 million.


Debt
repurchase

In February 2006, the
company announced a cash tender offer of up to $500 million to repurchase
outstanding notes. An aggregate principal amount of $433 million was
repurchased in 2006 consisting of $144 million of 8.95% Debentures due 2019,
$194 million of 7.85% Debentures due 2010 and $95 million of 8-1/2% Debentures
due 2022. The repurchase of these notes for approximately $500 million resulted
in an expense of $70 million pretax in 2006, which was included in other operating
expenses.

4. CASH
FLOW INFORMATION

For purposes of the
statement of consolidated cash flows, the company considers investments with
purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Substantially all of the company’s short-term borrowings, excluding the current
maturities of long-term borrowings, mature or may require payment within three
months or less.

The Equipment Operations
sell most of their trade receivables to Financial Services. These intercompany
cash flows are eliminated in the consolidated cash flows.

All cash flows from the
changes in trade accounts and notes receivable (see Note 10) are classified as
operating activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as these
receivables arise from sales to the company’s customers. Cash flows from
financing receivables (see Note 11) that are related to sales to the company’s
customers are also included in operating activities. The remaining financing
receivables are related to the financing of equipment sold by independent
dealers and are included in investing activities.

The company had the
following non-cash operating and investing activities that were not included in
the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. The company transferred inventory to
equipment on operating leases of approximately $269 million, $290 million and
$256 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The company had accounts
payable related to purchases of property and equipment of approximately $100
million, $80 million and $55 million at October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. At October 31, 2007, the company recorded a receivable of $47
million for a portion of the sale of a business and a liability of $41 million
for a portion of the acquisition of a business.

Cash payments for interest
and income taxes consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

*    Includes
interest compensation to Financial Services for financing trade receivables.

5. PENSION
AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The company has several
defined benefit pension plans covering its U.S. employees and employees in
certain foreign countries. The company has several postretirement health care
and life insurance plans for retired employees in the U.S. and Canada. The
company uses an October 31 measurement date for these plans.

On October 31, 2007, the
company adopted FASB Statement No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. This Statement requires
retirement benefit liabilities or benefit assets on the balance sheet to be
adjusted to the difference between the benefit obligations and the plan assets
at fair value. The offset to the adjustment is recorded directly in
stockholders’ equity net of tax. The amount recorded in stockholders’ equity
represents the after-tax unamortized actuarial gains or losses and unamortized
prior service cost (credit). This Statement also requires all benefit
obligations and plan assets to be measured at fiscal year end, which the
company presently does. Prospective application of the new accounting is
required.

The incremental effects of
the adoption of FASB Statement No. 158 on October 31, 2007 in millions of
dollars follow:

The worldwide components of
net periodic pension cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of
the following in millions of dollars and in percents:


The worldwide components of
net periodic postretirement benefits cost and the assumptions related to the
cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents:

The worldwide benefit plan
obligations, funded status and the assumptions related to the obligations at
October 31 in millions of dollars follow:

The amounts recognized at
October 31 in millions of dollars consist of the following:

The total accumulated benefit obligations for all
pension plans at October 31, 2007 and 2006 was $8,131 million and $8,322 million,
respectively.

The accumulated benefit
obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated
benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $741 million and $312
million, respectively, at October 31, 2007 and $805 million and $111 million,
respectively, at October 31, 2006. The projected benefit obligations and fair
value of plan assets for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets were $877 million and $368 million, respectively, at
October 31, 2007 and $927 million and $158 million, respectively, at October
31, 2006.

The amounts in accumulated
other comprehensive income that are expected to be amortized as net expense
(income) during fiscal 2008 in millions of dollars follow:

The company expects to
contribute approximately $134 million to its pension plans and approximately
$294 million to its health care and life insurance plans in 2008, which include
direct benefit payments on unfunded plans. These expected contributions also
include voluntary contributions to pension plan assets of approximately $80
million and health care plan assets of approximately $220 million during 2008.


The benefits expected to be
paid from the benefit plans, which reflect expected future years of service,
and the Medicare subsidy expected to be received are as follows in millions of
dollars:

*

Medicare Part D
  subsidy.

The annual rates of increase
in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (the health care cost
trend rates) used to determine benefit obligations at October 31, 2007
were based on the trends for medical and prescription drug claims for pre- and
post-65 age groups due to the effects of Medicare. The weighted-average
composite trend rates were assumed to be 8.0 percent for 2008, 7.1 percent for
2009, 6.3 percent for 2010, 5.8 percent for 2011, 5.2 percent for 2012 and 5.0
percent for 2013 and all future years. The obligations at October 31, 2006
assumed 8.1 percent for 2007, 7.1 percent for 2008, 6.1 percent for 2009, 5.4
percent for 2010 and 5.0 percent for 2011 and all future years. An increase of
one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at October 31, 2007 by
$528 million and the aggregate of service and interest cost component of net
periodic postretirement benefits cost for the year by $52 million. A decrease
of one percentage point would decrease the obligations by $443 million and the
cost by $42 million.

The discount rate
assumptions used to determine the postretirement obligations at October 31,
2007 and 2006 were based on a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a
series of annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying the
yield curve is required to have a rating of Aa or better by Moody’s Investor
Service, Inc. or a rating AA or better by Standard & Poor’s.

The following is the
percentage allocation for plan assets at October 31:

The primary investment
objective is to maximize the growth of the pension and health care plan assets
to meet the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of
time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with the company’s earnings
strength and risk tolerance. Asset allocation policy is the most important
decision in managing the assets and it is reviewed regularly. The asset
allocation policy considers the company’s financial strength and long-term
asset class risk/ return expectations since the obligations are long-term in
nature. On an on-going basis, the target allocations for pension assets are
approximately 35 percent for equity securities, 43 percent for debt securities,
4 percent for real estate and 18 percent for other, and for health care assets
are approximately 48 percent for equity securities, 38 percent for debt
securities, 3 percent for real estate and 11 percent for other. The assets are
well diversified and are managed by professional investment firms as well as by
investment professionals who are company employees.

The expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets reflects management’s expectations of long-term
average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in
the projected benefit obligations. The expected return is based on the outlook
for inflation, fixed income returns and equity returns, while also considering
historical returns, asset allocation and investment strategy. Although not a
guarantee of future results, the average annual return of the company’s U.S.
pension fund was approximately 9 percent during the past ten years and
approximately 12 percent during the past 20 years.

The company has created
certain Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association trusts (VEBAs) for the
funding of postretirement health care benefits. The future expected asset returns
for these VEBAs are lower than the expected return on the other pension and
health care plan assets due to investment in a higher proportion of short-term
liquid securities. These assets are in addition to the other postretirement
health care plan assets that have been funded under Section 401(h) of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and maintained in a separate account in the
company’s pension plan trust.

See Note 25 for defined
contribution plans related to employee investment and savings.

6. INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes from continuing operations by taxing
jurisdiction and by significant component consisted of the following in
millions of dollars:

Based upon location of the
company’s operations, the consolidated income from continuing operations before
income taxes in the U.S. in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $1,601 million, $1,431
million and $1,226 million, respectively, and in foreign countries was $1,075
million, $743 million and $881 million, respectively. Certain foreign
operations are branches of Deere & Company and are, therefore, subject
to U.S., as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income by
location


and the preceding analysis
of the income tax provision by taxing jurisdiction are, therefore, not directly
related.

A comparison of the
statutory and effective income tax provision from continuing operations and
reasons for related differences in millions of dollars follow:

In October 2004, the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act
introduced a special one- time dividends received deduction on the repatriation
of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation provision),
provided certain criteria are met. The deduction is 85 percent of certain
foreign earnings that are repatriated. During 2005, the company recognized a
tax benefit of approximately $15 million, related to the repatriation of
foreign earnings under the Act.

At October 31, 2007,
accumulated earnings in certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. totaled $814
million for which no provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding
taxes has been made, because it is expected that such earnings will be
reinvested overseas indefinitely. Determination of the amount of unrecognized
deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practical.

Deferred income taxes arise
because there are certain items that are treated differently for financial
accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of the deferred
income tax assets and liabilities at October 31 in millions of dollars
follows:

Deere & Company
files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes the
wholly-owned Financial Services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for
income taxes generally as if they filed separate income tax returns.

At October 31, 2007,
certain tax loss and tax credit carryforwards for $118 million were available
with $85 million expiring from 2008 through 2027 and $33 million with an
unlimited expiration date.

7. OTHER INCOME AND OTHER OPERATING
EXPENSES

The major components of
other income and other operating expenses from continuing operations consisted
of the following in millions of dollars:

*

Certain reclassifications
  from other to service revenues and costs were made in 2006 and 2005 consistent
  with the 2007 presentation.

8. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED
COMPANIES

Unconsolidated affiliated
companies are companies in which Deere & Company generally owns 20
percent to 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares. Deere &
Company does not control these companies and accounts for its investments in
them on the equity basis. The investments in these companies primarily consist
of Deere-Hitachi Construction Machinery Corporation (50 percent ownership),
Bell Equipment Limited (32 percent ownership) and A&I Products (36 percent
ownership). The unconsolidated affiliated companies primarily manufacture or
market equipment. Deere & Company’s share of the income of these
companies is reported in the consolidated income statement under “Equity in
Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates.” The investment in these companies is
reported in the consolidated balance sheet under “Investments in Unconsolidated
Affiliates.”

Combined financial
information of the unconsolidated affiliated companies in millions of dollars
is as follows:

9. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

All marketable securities
are classified as available-for-sale, with unrealized gains and losses shown as
a component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains or losses from the sales of
marketable securities are based on the specific identification method.

The amortized cost and fair
value of marketable securities for continuing operations at October 31 in
millions of dollars follow:

The contractual maturities
of debt securities at October 31, 2007 in millions of dollars follow:

Actual maturities may differ
from contractual maturities because some securities may be called or prepaid.
Proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities from continuing
operations were $1,379 million in 2007, $2,157 million in 2006 and $917 in
2005. Realized gains were $4 million and $.4 million and realized losses were
$10 million and $4 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Realized gains and
losses were not significant in 2005. Unrealized gains and losses, the increase
(decrease) in net unrealized gains or losses and unrealized losses that have
been continuous for over twelve months were not significant in any years
presented. Unrealized losses at October 31, 2006 were primarily the result
of an increase in interest rates and were not recognized in income due to the
ability and intent to hold to maturity. Losses related to impairment
write-downs were $7 million in 2007 and were not significant for any other
years presented.

10. TRADE ACCOUNTS AND NOTES
RECEIVABLE

Trade accounts and notes
receivable at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of
dollars:

At October 31, 2007 and
2006, dealer notes included in the previous table were $413 million and $398
million, and the allowance for doubtful trade receivables was $64 million and
$62 million, respectively.

The Equipment Operations
sell a significant portion of newly originated trade receivables to the credit
operations and provide compensation to the credit operations at market rates of
interest for these receivables.

Trade accounts and
notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers.
Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is charged to dealers on
outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to
retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free
periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is
received by the company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after the equipment is
shipped and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to
retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of
equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one
to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended.
Interest charged may not be forgiven and interest rates, which exceed the prime
rate, are set based on market factors. The company evaluates and assesses
dealers on an ongoing basis as to their credit worthiness and generally retains
a security interest in the goods associated with these trade receivables. The
company is obligated to repurchase goods sold to a dealer upon cancellation or
termination of the dealer’s contract for such causes as change in ownership and
closeout of the business. The company may also in certain circumstances
repurchase goods sold to a dealer in order to satisfy a request for goods from
another dealer.

Trade accounts and notes
receivable have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agricultural,
commercial and consumer, and construction and forestry sectors as shown in the
previous table. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate
concentration of credit risk in any area.


11. FINANCING RECEIVABLES

Financing receivables at October 31
consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

Financing receivables have
significant concentrations of credit risk in the agricultural, commercial and
consumer, and construction and forestry sectors as shown in the previous table.
On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit
risk in any area. The company retains as collateral a security interest in the
equipment associated with retail notes, wholesale notes and financing leases.

Financing receivables at October 31
related to the company’s sales of equipment (see note 4) that were included in
the table above were unrestricted and consisted of the following in millions of
dollars:

*

These retail notes generally arise from sales of
  equipment by company-owned dealers or through direct sales.

Financing receivable
installments, including unearned finance income, at October 31 are
scheduled as follows in millions of dollars:

The maximum terms for retail
notes are generally seven years for agricultural equipment, seven years for
commercial and consumer equipment and five years for construction and forestry
equipment. The maximum term for financing leases is generally five years, while
the average term for wholesale notes is less than twelve months.

At October 31, 2007 and
2006, the unpaid balances of receivables previously sold by the credit
operations were $453 million and $1,197 million, respectively. The receivables
sold are collateralized by security interests in the related equipment sold to
customers. At October 31, 2007 and 2006, worldwide financing receivables
administered, which include financing receivables previously sold but still
administered, totaled $18,373 million and $17,572 million, respectively.

Generally when
financing receivables become approximately 120 days delinquent, accrual of
finance income is suspended and the estimated uncollectible amount is written off
to the allowance for credit losses. Accrual of finance income is resumed when
the receivable becomes contractually current and collection doubts are removed.
Investments in financing receivables on non-accrual status at October 31,
2007 and 2006 were $59 million and $44 million, respectively.

Total financing receivable
amounts 60 days or more past due were $46 million at October 31, 2007,
compared with $45 million at October 31, 2006. These past-due amounts
represented .25 percent of the receivables financed at October 31, 2007
and .27 percent at October 31, 2006. The allowance for doubtful financing
receivables represented .95 percent and .94 percent of financing receivables
outstanding at October 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, at October 31,
2007 and 2006, the company’s credit operations had $192 million and $194
million, respectively, of deposits


withheld from dealers and
merchants available for potential credit losses. An analysis of the allowance
for doubtful financing receivables follows in millions of dollars:

12. SECURITIZATION OF FINANCING
RECEIVABLES

The company, as a part of
its overall funding strategy, periodically transfers certain financing receivables
(retail notes) into special purpose entities (SPEs) as part of its asset-backed
securities programs (securitizations) involving its retail notes. For
securitizations entered into prior to 2005, the structure of these transactions
is such that the transfer of the retail notes met the criteria of sales in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. Beginning in
2005, the transfer of retail notes into new securitization transactions did not
meet the sales criteria of FASB Statement No. 140 and are, therefore, accounted
for as secured borrowings. SPEs utilized in securitizations of retail notes
differ from other entities included in the company’s consolidated statements
because the assets they hold are legally isolated. For bankruptcy analysis
purposes, the company has sold the receivables to the SPEs in a true sale and
the SPEs are separate legal entities. Use of the assets held by the SPEs is
restricted by terms of the documents governing the securitization transaction.
Further information related to the secured borrowings and sales of retail notes
is provided below.

Secured Borrowings

In securitizations of retail
notes related to secured borrowings, the retail notes are transferred to
certain SPEs which in turn issue debt to investors. The resulting secured
borrowings are included in short-term borrowings on the balance sheet as shown
in the following table. The securitized retail notes are recorded as “Restricted
financing receivables - net” on the balance sheet. The total restricted assets
on the balance sheet related to these securitizations include the restricted
financing receivables less an allowance for credit losses, and other assets representing
restricted cash as shown in the following table. The SPEs supporting the
secured borrowings to which the retail notes are transferred are consolidated
unless the company is not the primary beneficiary or the SPE is a qualified
special purpose entity as defined in FASB Statement No. 140.

The components of
consolidated restricted assets related to secured borrowings in securitization
transactions at October 31 were as follows in millions of dollars:

The components of
consolidated secured borrowings and other liabilities related to
securitizations at October 31 were as follows in millions of dollars:

The secured borrowings
related to these restricted securitized retail notes are obligations that are
payable as the retail notes are liquidated. Repayment of the secured borrowings
depends primarily on cash flows generated by the restricted assets. Due to the
company’s short-term credit rating, cash collections from these restricted
assets are not required to be placed into a restricted collection account until
immediately prior to the time payment is required to the secured creditors.
Under FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities, an SPE was consolidated that included assets
(restricted retail notes) of $1,494 million and $1,147 million at October 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. These restricted retail notes are included in the
restricted financing receivables related to securitizations shown in the table
above. At October 31, 2007, the maximum remaining term of all restricted
receivables was approximately six years.

Sales of Receivables

Prior to 2005, the company
periodically transferred certain retail notes into SPEs as part of its
securitization program in transactions that were structured such that the
transfer of the retail notes met the criteria of sales in accordance with FASB Statement
No. 140. The SPEs issue asset-backed securities to investors and use the
proceeds of the debt issuance to pay for the retail notes. However, the company
retains certain interests in the SPEs’ assets including interest-only strips, a
reserve account and subordinated certificates. These interests that continue to
be held by the company (transferor) are carried at estimated fair value in “Other
receivables” or “Other assets” on the balance sheet. Gains or losses on sales
of the receivables depended in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial
assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets sold and the
interests that continue to be held based on their relative fair values at the
date of transfer. The company generally estimates fair values based on the
present value of future expected cash flows using management’s key assumptions as
discussed below. The company retains the rights to certain future cash flows
and in the U.S. transactions receives annual servicing fees approximating one
percent of the outstanding balance. No significant balances for servicing
assets or liabilities exist because the benefits received for servicing are
just adequate to compensate the servicer for the costs of providing the servicing.
The company’s maximum exposure under recourse provisions related to securitized
sold retail notes at October 31, 2007 and 2006 was $20 million and $109
million, respectively. The recourse provisions contractually specified by the
documents governing the securitization transaction are contingent liabilities
that are remote at this time. Except for this exposure, the investors and
securitization trusts have no recourse to the


company for failure of
debtors to pay when due. The interests that continue to be held by the company,
are subordinate to investors’ interests and their values are subject to certain
key assumptions as shown below. The total assets of the unconsolidated SPEs
related to these securitizations at October 31, 2007 and 2006 were $120
million and $994 million, respectively. At October 31, 2007, the maximum
remaining term of these receivables sold was approximately three years.

Cash flows received from
securitization trusts for retail notes sold in prior years in millions of
dollars were as follows:




Servicing fees received

The company has utilized a
revolving multi-bank conduit facility to securitize floating rate retail notes
that were structured as either sales or secured borrowings. In September 2007,
the company amended the facility and simultaneously repurchased $264 million of
retail notes previously sold into the facility.

Components of interests that
continue to be held by the company in securitized retail notes sold at October 31
in millions of dollars follow:

The total interests that
continue to be held by the company, weighted-average life, weighted-average
current key economic assumptions and the sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical
effects on these interests from immediate 10 percent and 20 percent adverse
changes in those assumptions with dollars in millions were as follows:

*

Impacts are less than $.1
  million.

These sensitivities are
hypothetical changes in fair value and cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the changes in assumption to the changes in fair value may not
be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption is
calculated without changing any other assumption, whereas changes in one factor
may result in changes in another.

Accordingly, no assurance can be given that
actual results would be consistent with the results of these estimates.

Principal balances of owned,
securitized retail notes sold and total managed retail notes; past due amounts;
and credit losses (net of recoveries) as of and for the years ended October 31,
in millions of dollars follow:

13. OTHER RECEIVABLES

Other receivables for
continuing operations at October 31 consisted of the following in millions
of dollars:

The credit operations’
receivables related to securitizations are equal to the present value of
payments to be received for certain interests that continue to be held by the
company and deposits made with other entities for recourse provisions under the
retail note sales agreements (see Note 12).

14. EQUIPMENT ON OPERATING LEASES

Operating leases arise
primarily from the leasing of John Deere equipment to retail customers. Initial
lease terms generally range from 36 to 60 months. Net equipment on operating
leases totaled $1,705 million and $1,494 million at October 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over
the terms of the leases. The accumulated depreciation on this equipment was
$520 million and $460 million at October 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
corresponding depreciation expense was $297 million in 2007, $269 million in
2006 and $237 million in 2005.

Future payments to be
received on operating leases totaled $779 million at October 31, 2007 and
are scheduled as follows in millions of dollars: 2008 – $339, 2009 – $227, 2010
– $133, 2011 – $63 and 2012 – $17.

15. INVENTORIES

Most inventories owned by
Deere & Company and its United States equipment subsidiaries are
valued at cost, on the “last-in, first-out” (LIFO) basis. Remaining inventories
are generally valued at the lower of cost, on the “first-in, first-out” (FIFO)
basis, or market. The value of gross inventories on the LIFO basis represented
58 percent and 60 percent of worldwide


gross inventories at FIFO
value on October 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. If all inventories had
been valued on a FIFO basis, estimated inventories by major classification at October 31
in millions of dollars would have been as follows:

16. PROPERTY AND DEPRECIATION

A summary of property and
equipment for continuing operations at October 31 in millions of dollars
follows:

*

Weighted-averages

Leased property under
capital leases amounting to $23 million and $15 million at October 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively, is included in property and equipment.

Property and equipment is
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Total property and equipment
additions in 2007, 2006 and 2005 for continuing operations were $1,064 million,
$781 million and $523 million and depreciation was $402 million, $379 million
and $354 million, respectively. Capitalized interest was $31 million, $6
million and $2 million in the same periods, respectively. Financial Services
property and equipment additions included above were $476 million, $292 million
and $46 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005 and depreciation was $13 million, $8
million and $5 million, respectively. The increase in Financial Services
additions in 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to wind turbines related to
investments in wind energy generation.

Capitalized software is
stated at cost less accumulated amortization, and the estimated useful life is
three years. The amounts of total capitalized software costs, including
purchased and internally developed software, classified as “Other Assets” for
continuing operations at October 31, 2007 and 2006 were $345 million and
$322 million, less accumulated amortization of $270 million and $258 million,
respectively. Amortization of these software costs was $33 million in 2007, $32
million in 2006 and $35 million in 2005.

The cost of compliance with
foreseeable environmental requirements has been accrued and did not have a
material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations.

17. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE
ASSETS-NET

The amounts of goodwill by
operating segment were as follows in millions of dollars:

The goodwill in the
agricultural equipment segment decreased by approximately $23 million in 2007
due to an adjustment of the goodwill related to a 2006 acquisition and the
recognition of identifiable intangible assets from the acquisition. The
goodwill in the commercial and consumer equipment segment increased by $92
million in 2007 due to an acquisition (see Note 1). The remaining changes in
goodwill were primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The components of other
intangible assets are as follows in millions of dollars:

Before adoption of FASB
  Statement No. 158.

Other intangible assets,
excluding the intangible pension asset, are stated at cost less accumulated
amortization. The amortization of other intangible assets in 2007, 2006 and
2005 were $12 million, $11 million and $2 million, respectively. The estimated
amortization expense for the next five years are as follows in millions of
dollars: 2008 - $13, 2009 - $11, 2010 - $11, 2011 - $10, and 2012 - $10.


18. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Short-term borrowings at October 31
consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

The notes payable related to
securitizations for Financial Services are secured by restricted financing
receivables (retail notes) on the balance sheet (see Note 12). Although these
notes payable are classified as short-term since payment is required if the
retail notes are liquidated early, the payment schedule for these borrowings of
$2,344 million at October 31, 2007 based on the expected liquidation of
the retail notes in millions of dollars is as follows: 2008 - $1,015, 2009 -
$713, 2010 - $438, 2011 - $156, 2012 - $22.

The weighted-average
interest rates on total short-term borrowings, excluding current maturities of
long-term borrowings, at October 31, 2007 and 2006 were 5.1 percent in
both years. All of the Financial Services’ short-term borrowings represent obligations
of the credit subsidiaries.

Lines of credit available
from U.S. and foreign banks were $3,894 million at October 31, 2007. Some
of these credit lines are available to both Deere & Company and John
Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation). At October 31, 2007, $904
million of these worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of
computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank
borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings,
were considered to constitute utilization.

Included in the above lines
of credit was a long-term credit facility agreement for $3.75 billion, expiring
in February 2012. The agreement is mutually extendable and the annual facility
fee is not significant. The credit agreement requires the Capital Corporation
to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less
than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding
securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and
stockholder’s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss))
at not more than 9.5 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit
agreement also requires the Equipment Operations to maintain a ratio of total
debt to total capital (total debt and stockholders’ equity excluding
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end
of each fiscal quarter according to accounting principles generally accepted in
the U.S. in effect at October 31, 2006. Under this provision, the company’s
excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at October 31,
2007 was $6,661 million.

Alternatively under this provision, the Equipment Operations had the
capacity to incur additional debt of $12,370 million at October 31, 2007.
All of these requirements of the credit agreement have been met during the
periods included in the financial statements.

Deere & Company has
an agreement with the Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has agreed to
continue to own at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of
the Capital Corporation and to maintain the Capital Corporation’s consolidated
tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. This agreement also obligates
Deere & Company to make income maintenance payments to the Capital
Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is
not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere & Company’s
obligations to make payments to the Capital Corporation under the agreement are
independent of whether the Capital Corporation is in default on its
indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, Deere &
Company’s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of the
Capital Corporation’s indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Deere &
Company’s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly
stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or
liability of the Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name
of the Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement
during the periods included in the financial statements.

19. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED
EXPENSES

Accounts payable and accrued
expenses at October 31 for continuing operations consisted of the
following in millions of dollars:

*

Primarily trade receivable valuation
  accounts which are reclassified as accrued

expenses by
  the Equipment Operations as a result of their trade receivables being sold to
  Financial Services.


20. LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

Long-term borrowings at October 31
consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

*

Includes fair value
  adjustments related to interest rate swaps.

**

All interest rates are as
  of year end.

All of the Financial
Services’ long-term borrowings represent obligations of the credit
subsidiaries.

The approximate principal
amounts of the Equipment Operations’ long-term borrowings maturing in each of
the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2008 – $6, 2009 –
$9, 2010 – $312, 2011 – none and 2012 – none. The approximate principal amounts
of the credit subsidiaries’ long-term borrowings maturing in each of the next
five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2008 – $4,619, 2009 – $3,899,
2010 – $1,975, 2011 – $944 and 2012 – $1,881.

21. LEASES

At October 31, 2007,
future minimum lease payments under capital leases amounted to $29 million as
follows: 2008 – $3, 2009 – $3, 2010 – $3, 2011 – $2, 2012 – $2 and later years
$16. Total rental expense for operating leases was $126 million in 2007, $118
million in 2006 and $111 million in 2005. At October 31, 2007, future
minimum lease payments under

operating leases amounted to $358 million as follows:  2008 – $100, 2009 – $73, 2010 – $47, 2011 –
$32, 2012 – $26 and later years $80.

22. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

The company generally
determines its total warranty liability by applying historical claims rate
experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still
under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical
claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and
current quality developments.

A reconciliation of the
changes in the warranty liability in millions of dollars follows:

The premiums for the
Equipment Operations’ extended warranties are primarily recognized in income in
proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. These
unamortized warranty premiums totaled $77 million and $45 million at October
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The company has certain
recourse obligations on financing receivables that it has previously sold. If
the receivables sold are not collected, the company would be required to cover
those losses up to the amount of its recourse obligation. At October 31,
2007, the maximum amount of exposure to losses under these agreements was $30
million. The estimated credit risk associated with sold receivables totaled $1
million at October 31, 2007. This risk of loss is recognized primarily in
the interests that continue to be held by the company and recorded on it’s
balance sheet (see Note 12). The company may recover a portion of any required
payments incurred under these agreements from the repossession of the equipment
collateralizing the receivables. At October 31, 2007, the maximum
remaining term of the receivables guaranteed was approximately three years.

At October 31,
2007, the company had approximately $190 million of guarantees issued primarily
to banks outside the U.S. and Canada related to third-party receivables for the
retail financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of
any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the
equipment collateralizing the receivables. At October 31, 2007, the
company had accrued losses of approximately $6 million under these agreements.
The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October 31,
2007 was approximately eight years.

The credit operations’
subsidiary, John Deere Risk Protection, Inc., offers crop insurance
products through a managing general agency agreement (Agreement) with an
insurance company (Insurance Carrier) rated “Excellent” by A.M. Best
Company. As a managing general agent, John Deere Risk Protection, Inc.
will receive commissions from the Insurance Carrier for selling crop insurance
to producers. The credit operations have guaranteed certain obligations under
the Agreement, including the obligation to pay the Insurance


Carrier for any uncollected
premiums. At October 31, 2007, the maximum exposure for uncollected
premiums was approximately $57 million. Substantially all of the credit
operations’ crop insurance risk under the Agreement has been mitigated by a
syndicate of private reinsurance companies. The reinsurance

companies are rated
“Excellent” or higher by A.M. Best Company. In the event of a widespread
catastrophic crop failure throughout the U.S. and the default of these highly
rated private reinsurance companies on their reinsurance obligations, the
credit operations would be required to reimburse the Insurance Carrier for
exposure under the Agreement of approximately $489 million at October 31,
2007. The credit operations believe that the likelihood of the occurrence of
events that give rise to the exposures under this Agreement is substantially
remote and as a result, at October 31, 2007, the credit operation’s accrued
liability under the Agreement was not material.

At October 31, 2007,
the company had commitments of approximately $379 million for the construction
and acquisition of property and equipment. At October 31, 2007, the
company also had pledged or restricted assets of $144 million, primarily as
collateral for borrowings. Also, see Note 12 for restricted assets associated
with borrowings related to securitizations.

The company also had other
miscellaneous contingent liabilities totaling approximately $55 million at October 31,
2007, for which it believes the probability for payment is remote.

The company is subject to
various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its
business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including
asbestos related liability), retail credit, software licensing, patent and
trademark matters. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the
outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, the
company believes these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect
on its financial statements.

23. CAPITAL STOCK

Changes in the common stock account in millions were as follows:

*

Adjusted for two-for-one
  stock split.

**

See Note 1 for
  reclassification.

On November 14, 2007,
the stockholders of the company approved a two-for-one stock split effected in
the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to stockholders of record on November 26,
2007, distributed on December 3, 2007. This stock split has been recorded
as of October 31, 2007 by a transfer of $268 million from retained
earnings to common stock, representing a $1 par value for each additional share
issued. The number of common shares the company is authorized to issue was also
increased from 600 million to 1,200 million. The number of authorized preferred
shares, none of which has been issued, remained at nine million.

In May 2007, the board
of directors authorized plans to repurchase up to 40 million (post stock split)
additional shares of common stock. The new repurchase plan went into effect
after the previous 52 million (post stock split) share repurchase plan,
announced in November 2005, was completed in August 2007. Repurchases
will be made at the company’s discretion in the open market.

A reconciliation of basic
and diluted income per share follows in millions, except per share amounts:

*

Adjusted for two-for-one
  stock split.

All stock options
outstanding were included in the computation during 2007, 2006 and 2005, except
18 thousand stock options in 2006 on a post stock split basis that had an
antidilutive effect under the treasury stock method.

24. STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK
AWARDS

In the first quarter of
2006, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),
Share-Based Payment, (see Note 1 for “Share-Based Compensation” for 2005
information).

The company issues stock
options and restricted stock awards to key employees under plans approved by
stockholders. Restricted stock is also issued to nonemployee directors for
their services as directors under a plan approved by stockholders. Options are
awarded with the exercise price equal to the market price and become
exercisable in one to three years after grant. Options expire ten years after
the date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest after three years.
The company recognizes the compensation cost on these stock options and restricted
stock awards either immediately if the employee is eligible to retire or on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award. According to
these plans at October 31, 2007, the company is authorized to grant an
additional 18.7 million shares related to stock options or restricted stock on
a post stock split basis.


The fair value of each
option award was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice option
valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded
call options on the company’s stock. The expected volatilities are constructed
from the following three components: the starting implied volatility of
short-term call options traded within a few days of the valuation date; the
predicted implied volatility of long-term call options; and the trend in
implied volatilities over the span of the call options’ time to maturity. The
company uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee
termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is
derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period
of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free
rates utilized for periods throughout the contractual life of the options are
based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant.

The assumptions used for the
binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of options follow:

Stock option activity at
October 31, 2007 and changes during 2007 in millions of dollars and shares
except for share price follow:

*

Adjusted for
  two-for-one stock split.

**

Weighted-averages

The weighted-average
grant-date fair values of options granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
$14.10, $10.10 and $9.99 on a post stock split basis, respectively. The total
intrinsic values of options exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $320
million, $236 million and $102 million, respectively. During 2007, 2006 and 2005,
cash received from stock option exercises was $286 million, $328 million and
$154 million with tax benefits of $119 million, $87 million and $38 million,
respectively.

The company’s nonvested
restricted shares at October 31, 2007 and changes during 2007 in millions of
dollars and shares follow:

*

Adjusted for
  two-for-one stock split.

**

Weighted-averages

During 2007 and 2006, the
total share-based compensation expense was $82 million and $91 million with an
income tax benefit recognized in net income of $30 million and $34 million. At
October 31, 2007, there was $28 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
from share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans, which is related
to nonvested shares. This compensation is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately 2 years. The total fair values of
stock options and restricted shares vested during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $69
million, $63 million and $55 million, respectively.

Prior to adoption of the new
standard, the pro-forma disclosure used a straight-line amortization of the stock
option and restricted stock expense over the vesting period according to the
prior standard, FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which included employees eligible to retire. Under the new
standard, the awards granted after the adoption must be recognized in expense
over the requisite service period, which is either immediate if the employee is
eligible to retire, or over the vesting period if the employee is not eligible
to retire. The amount of expense for awards granted prior to adoption of the
new standard for employees eligible to retire that continued to be amortized
over the nominal vesting period in 2007 and 2006 was approximately $12 million
and $19 million pretax, $8 million and $12 million after-tax ($.02 per share and
$.03 per share, basic and diluted), respectively.

The company currently uses
shares which have been repurchased through its stock repurchase programs to
satisfy share option exercises. At October 31, 2007, the company had 96.8
million shares in treasury stock and 34.9 million shares remaining to be
repurchased under its current publicly announced 40.0 million share repurchase
program on a post stock split basis.

25.
EMPLOYEE INVESTMENT AND SAVINGS PLANS

The company has defined
contribution plans related to employee investment and savings plans primarily
in the U.S. Company contributions and costs under these plans were $114 million
in 2007, $100 million in 2006 and $81 million in 2005.


26. OTHER
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS

Other comprehensive income
items under FASB Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, are
transactions recorded in stockholders’ equity during the year, excluding net
income and transactions with stockholders. Following are the items included in
other comprehensive income (loss) and the related tax effects in millions of
dollars:

*

Reclassification
  of realized gains or losses to net income were not material.

*

Reclassification
  of realized gains or losses to net income were not material.

27.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair values of financial
instruments that do not approximate the carrying values in the financial
statements at October 31 in millions of dollars follow:

*

See Note 18.

Fair Value
Estimates

Fair values of the long-term
financing receivables with fixed rates were based on the discounted values of
their related cash flows at current market interest rates. The fair values of
the remaining financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts.

Fair values of long-term
borrowings and short-term secured borrowings with fixed rates were based on the
discounted values of their related cash flows at current market interest rates.
Certain long-term borrowings have been swapped to current variable interest
rates. The carrying values of these long-term borrowings include adjustments
related to fair value hedges.

Derivatives

All derivative instruments
are recorded at fair values and classified as either other assets or accounts
payable and accrued expenses on the balance sheet (see Note 1).

Interest
Rate Swaps

The company enters into
interest rate swap agreements primarily to more closely match the fixed or
floating interest rates of the credit operations’ borrowings to those of the
assets being funded. For transactions not designated as hedges under FASB
Statement No. 133, the fair value gains or losses from these interest rate swaps
are recognized currently in interest expense, generally offsetting the interest
expense on the exposures being hedged.

Certain interest rate swaps
were designated as hedges of future cash flows from variable interest rate
borrowings. The effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these cash
flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently
reclassified into interest expense as payments are accrued and the swaps
approach maturity. These amounts offset the effects of interest rate changes on
the related borrowings. Gains or losses in other comprehensive income related
to cash flow hedges that have been discontinued are amortized to interest
expense over the remaining duration of the original forecasted transaction that
will still occur. The total amount of gain recorded in other comprehensive
income at October 31, 2007 that is expected to be reclassified to interest
expense in the next twelve months if interest rates remain unchanged is approximately
$2 million after-tax. These swaps mature in up to forty-one months.


Certain interest rate swaps
were designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate, long-term borrowings. The
effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these swaps were offset
by fair value adjustments in the underlying borrowings.

Any ineffective portions of
the gains or losses on all cash flow and fair value interest rate swaps
designated as hedges were recognized currently in interest expense and were not
material. There were no gains or losses reclassified from unrealized in other
comprehensive income to realized in earnings as a result of the discontinuance
of cash flow hedges because it is probable that the original forecasted
transaction will not occur. There were no components of cash flow or fair value
hedges that were excluded from the assessment of effectiveness.

The company has certain
interest rate swap agreements that are not designated as hedges under FASB
Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, and the fair value gains or losses are recognized currently in interest
expense. These swaps are used to facilitate certain borrowings.

The cash flows from all
interest rate swaps are related to managing interest rate exposures and are
recorded in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Foreign
Exchange Forward Contracts, Swaps and Options

The company has entered into
foreign exchange forward contracts, swaps and options in order to manage the
currency exposure of certain receivables, liabilities and expected inventory
purchases. For transactions not designated as hedges under FASB Statement No.
133, the fair value gains or losses from these foreign currency derivatives are
recognized currently in cost of sales or other operating expenses, generally
offsetting the foreign exchange gains or losses on the exposures being managed.

The company has designated
certain foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges of expected
inventory purchases. The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on
these cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and
subsequently reclassified into cost of sales as the inventory costs are
recognized in cost of sales. These amounts offset the effect of the changes in
foreign exchange rates on the related inventory purchases. The amount of the
gain recorded in other comprehensive income that is expected to be reclassified
to cost of sales in the next twelve months is approximately $.1 million
after-tax. These contracts mature in up to six months.

Any ineffective portions of
the gains or losses on all cash flow and fair value foreign exchange contracts
and swaps designated as hedges were recognized currently in earnings and were
not material. There were no gains or losses reclassified from unrealized in
other comprehensive income to realized in earnings as a result of the
discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it is probable that the original
forecasted transaction will not occur. There were no components of cash flow or
fair value hedges that were excluded from the assessment of effectiveness.

The cash flows from foreign
exchange forward contracts, swaps and options are related to purchases of
inventory and sales of equipment and are recorded in operating activities in
the consolidated statement of cash flows.

28. SEGMENT
AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA FOR THE YEARS

ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2007, 2006
AND 2005

The company’s operations are
organized and reported in four major business segments described as follows:

The agricultural equipment
segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm equipment and related
service parts – including tractors; combine, cotton and sugarcane harvesters; tillage,
seeding and soil preparation machinery; sprayers; hay and forage equipment;
integrated agricultural management systems technology; and precision
agricultural irrigation equipment.

The commercial and consumer
equipment segment manufactures and distributes equipment, products and service parts
for commercial and residential uses – including tractors for lawn, garden,
commercial and utility purposes; mowing equipment, including walk-behind
mowers; golf course equipment; utility vehicles; landscape and nursery
products; irrigation equipment; and other outdoor power products.

The construction and
forestry segment manufactures, distributes to dealers and sells at retail a
broad range of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving,
material handling and timber harvesting – including backhoe loaders; crawler
dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders;
articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; and log
skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and
related attachments.

The products and services
produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent
retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.

The credit segment primarily
finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agricultural,
commercial and consumer, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition,
it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, provides
operating loans, finances retail revolving charge accounts, offers certain crop
risk mitigation products and invests in wind energy generation.

The company’s tractors and
implements segment and the harvesting equipment segment have been aggregated in
the agricultural equipment segment described above since they have similar
economic characteristics as well as similar products and services, production
processes, types of customers and methods used for distribution of their
products.

Certain operations do not
meet the materiality threshold of FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and have been grouped together
as “Other.” Due to the sale of the health care operations in 2006 (see Note 2),
the health care operations were reclassified from “Other” to discontinued
operations for all years presented. Applicable segment information as follows has
been revised for this reclassification. The remaining “Other” information
consists of certain miscellaneous service operations that do not meet the
materiality threshold.

Because of integrated
manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing support, a
substantial number of allocations must be made to determine operating segment
and geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues represent sales of
components and finance charges, which are generally based on market prices.


Information relating to
operations by operating segment in millions of dollars follows. In addition to
the following unaffiliated sales and revenues by segment, intersegment sales and
revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: agricultural equipment net
sales of $104 million, $138 million and $105 million, construction and forestry
net sales of $9 million, $10 million and $13 million, and credit revenues of
$276 million, $216 million and $237 million, respectively.

*

Other revenues are
  primarily the Equipment Operations’ revenues for finance and interest income,
  and other income as disclosed in Note 30, net of certain intercompany
  eliminations.

*

Operating
  profit of the credit business segment includes the effect of its interest
  expense and foreign exchange gains or losses.

*

Does not
  include finance rental income for equipment on operating leases.

**

Includes
  interest income from Equipment Operations for financing trade receivables.

*

Includes
  interest compensation to credit operations for financing trade receivables.

*

Includes
  depreciation for equipment on operating leases.

*

Corporate assets are
  primarily the Equipment Operations’ retirement benefits, deferred income tax
  assets, marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in
  Note 30, net of certain intercompany eliminations.


The company views and has historically disclosed its
operations as consisting of two geographic areas, the U.S. and Canada, and
outside the U.S. and Canada, shown below in millions of dollars. No individual
foreign country’s net sales and revenues were material for disclosure purposes.

*

The percentages indicate
  the approximate proportion of each amount that relates to the U.S. only and
  are based upon a three-year average for 2007, 2006 and 2005.

meeting on November 29, 2007, payable on February 1, 2008 to stockholders of
record on December 31, 2007.

In December 2007, the
company’s credit operations issued $500 million of 4.95% medium–term notes due
in 2012 and entered into interest rate swaps related to these notes, which swapped
the fixed rate to a variable rate of 5.58% as of December 13, 2007.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Deere & Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
of October 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related statements of consolidated
income, changes in consolidated stockholders’ equity, and consolidated cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31,
2007.  Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index under Part IV, Item
15(2).  We also have audited the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company’s management is
responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  A company’s


internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended October 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.  Also,
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007, based on
the criteria established in

Internal Control
— Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission

.
