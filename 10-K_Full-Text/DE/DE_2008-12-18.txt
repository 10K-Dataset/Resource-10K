PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

Products

Deere & Company (Company) and its
subsidiaries (collectively called John Deere) have operations which are
categorized into four major business segments.

The

agricultural equipment

segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm equipment and related
service parts — including tractors; combine, cotton and sugarcane harvesters;
tillage, seeding, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; sprayers;
hay and forage equipment; integrated agricultural management systems
technology; and precision agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies.

The

commercial and consumer
equipment

segment manufactures and distributes equipment, products
and service parts for commercial and residential uses — including tractors for
lawn, garden, commercial and utility purposes; mowing equipment, including
walk-behind mowers; golf course equipment; utility vehicles; landscape and
nursery products; irrigation equipment; and other outdoor power products.

The

construction and forestry

segment manufactures, distributes to dealers and sells at retail a broad range
of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving, material
handling and timber harvesting — including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and
loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump
trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller
bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and related attachments.

The products and services produced by the
segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer
networks and major retail outlets.

The

credit

segment
primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used
agricultural, commercial and consumer, and construction and forestry equipment.
In addition, it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment,
provides operating loans, finances retail revolving charge accounts, offers
certain crop risk mitigation products and invests in wind energy generation.

John Deere’s worldwide agricultural
equipment; commercial and consumer equipment; and construction and forestry
operations are sometimes referred to as the “Equipment Operations.” The credit
and certain miscellaneous service operations are sometimes referred to as “Financial
Services.”

Additional information is presented in the
discussion of business segment and geographic area results on page 16. The
John Deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837. The
present Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1958.

The Company’s Internet address is
http://www.JohnDeere.com. Through that address, the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and
amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably
practicable after they are filed with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (“Securities and Exchange Commission” or “Commission”). The
information contained on the Company’s website is not included in, or
incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K.

Market Conditions and Outlook

Given
the sudden, sharp downturn in global economic activity, and the ongoing turmoil
in world financial markets, the outlook for the year ahead is highly uncertain
and its impact on the Company’s operations is difficult to assess.  Subject to the economic uncertainties,
Company equipment sales are projected to be about flat for the full year of
2009 and up about 7 percent for the first quarter. Included in the forecast is
a negative currency-translation impact of about 6 percent for both the full
year and first quarter. John Deere’s net income is forecast to be about $1.9
billion for 2009 and about $275 million for the first quarter.

Agricultural Equipment.

Worldwide sales of the Company’s
agricultural equipment are forecast to increase by about 5 percent for
full-year 2009. This includes a negative currency-translation impact of about 8
percent.

Farm-machinery
industry sales in the United States and Canada are forecast to be up about 5
percent for the year, led by an increase in large tractors and combines. The
company expects agricultural commodity prices to remain at healthy levels in
2009, though below the previous year, while costs moderate for key inputs such
as fuel and fertilizer. Sales of cotton equipment, small tractors, and equipment
commonly used by livestock producers are expected to be lower.

Industry
sales in Western Europe are forecast to be down 5 to 10 percent for the year.
Sales are expected to be down moderately in Central Europe and the CIS
(Commonwealth of Independent States) countries, including Russia. While demand
in these areas for


highly
productive farm equipment remains good, sales will depend on the availability
and cost of credit. Sales in South American markets are expected to be down 10
to 20 percent in 2009, with the decline related to credit access in Brazil and
drought conditions in Argentina.

Commercial & Consumer Equipment.

Reflecting the U.S. housing market decline
and recessionary economic conditions, John Deere commercial and consumer
equipment sales are projected to be down about 6 percent for the year. The
segment expects sales gains from new products to partly offset the impact of
the economic decline.

Construction & Forestry.

U.S. markets for construction and forestry
equipment are forecast to remain under pressure due to further deterioration in
the already-weakened housing sector, a steep decline in nonresidential
construction, and negative economic growth. The global economic slowdown is
expected to lead to a lower level of forestry equipment sales in both the
United States and Europe. Subject to the economic uncertainties discussed
earlier, John Deere’s worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment
are forecast to decline by approximately 12 percent for the year. Despite the
poor economic climate, company sales are expected to benefit from innovative
new products.

Credit.

Subject to the uncertainty associated with present economic
conditions, full-year 2009 net income for John Deere’s credit operations is
forecast to be approximately $300 million. The forecast decrease from 2008 is
primarily due to narrower financing spreads related to the current funding
environment.

2008 Consolidated Results Compared with 2007

Worldwide
net income in 2008 was $2,053 million, or $4.70 per share diluted ($4.76
basic), compared with $1,822 million, or $4.00 per share diluted ($4.05 basic),
in 2007. Net sales and revenues increased 18 percent to $28,438 million in
2008, compared with $24,082 million in 2007. Net sales of the Equipment
Operations increased 20 percent in 2008 to $25,803 million from $21,489 million
last year. This included a positive effect for currency translation of 4
percent and price changes of 2 percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada
increased 9 percent in 2008. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada increased by
40 percent, which included a positive effect of 10 percent for currency
translation.

Worldwide
Equipment Operations had an operating profit of $2,927 million in 2008,
compared with $2,318 million in 2007. Higher operating profit was primarily due
to the favorable impact of higher shipment volumes and improved price
realization. Partially offsetting these factors were increased raw material
costs, higher selling, administrative and general expenses, increased research
and development costs and expenses to close a facility in Canada (see Note 3).

The
Equipment Operations’ net income was $1,676 million in 2008, compared with
$1,429 million in 2007. The same operating factors mentioned above as well as a
higher effective tax rate this year affected these results.

Net
income of the company’s Financial Services operations in 2008 decreased to $337
million, compared with $364 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily a result
of increased selling, administrative and general expenses, an increase in
average leverage and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by
growth in the average credit portfolio. Additional information is presented in
the following discussion of the credit operations.

The
cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2008 was 75.9 percent, compared with 75.6
percent last year. The increase was primarily due to higher raw material costs,
partially offset by higher sales and production volumes and improved price
realization.

Additional information on 2008 results is
presented on pages 15 – 17.

EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS

Agricultural Equipment

The John Deere
worldwide agricultural equipment segment manufactures and distributes a full
line of farm equipment and related service parts, including tractors, combine,
cotton and sugar harvesting equipment, tillage, seeding, nutrient management
and soil preparation machinery, sprayers, hay and forage equipment, material
handling equipment, integrated agricultural systems technology, and precision
agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies.

Sales of
agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect
levels of farm commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields and governmental
policies, including the amount and timing of government payments. Sales are
also influenced by general economic conditions, farm land prices, farmers’ debt
levels and access to financing, interest and exchange rates, agricultural
trends, including the production of and demand for renewable fuels, energy
costs and other input costs associated with farming. Other important factors
affecting new equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment,
including tractors,


harvesting
equipment, self-propelled sprayers, hay and forage equipment and seeding
equipment. Weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of
equipment purchasers.

Innovations in machinery and technology also influence buying. For
example, larger, more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are
striving for more efficiency in their operations. The Company has developed a
comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced
technology and global satellite positioning to enable farmers to better control
input costs and yields, improve soil conservation and minimize chemical use and
to gather information.

Large, cost-efficient, highly-mechanized agricultural operations
account for an important share of worldwide farm output. The large-size
agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to
John Deere. A large proportion of the Equipment Operations’ total agricultural
equipment sales in the United States, and a growing proportion of sales outside
North America, is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower, self-propelled
combines, self-propelled cotton pickers, self-propelled forage harvesters,
self-propelled sprayers and seeding equipment.

The agricultural equipment segment also manufactures and sells a
variety of equipment attachments under the Frontier brand name as well as the
John Deere brand.

Seasonality

.
Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in
substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail
customers during various times of the year. Seasonal demand must be estimated
in advance, and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand
in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout
the year. For certain equipment, the Company offers early order discounts to
retail customers. Production schedules are based, in part, on these early order
programs. The agricultural equipment segment incurs substantial seasonal
variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of equipment. The
agricultural equipment segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in
advance of seasonal demand. New combine and cotton harvesting equipment has
been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges
available to customers who take delivery of machines during off-season periods.
In the U.S. and Canada, there are typically several used equipment trade-in transactions
for every new combine and cotton harvesting equipment sale. To provide support
to the Company’s dealers for these used equipment trade-ins, the Company
provides dealers with a fixed pool of funds, and the dealers are then
responsible for all associated inventory and sale costs using these funds.

An important
part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the
past decade has come from a diverse variety of short-line and specialty
manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. Because of
industry conditions, including the merger of certain large integrated
competitors and the global capability and emergence of many competitors, the
agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and may
become even more competitive.

John Deere
Water Technologies, a unit of the agricultural equipment segment, manufactures
and distributes precision irrigation products. In 2008, John Deere expanded its
water technology business with the acquisitions of T-Systems International, Inc.
and Plastro Irrigation Systems, Ltd.

Commercial and Consumer Equipment

The John Deere
commercial and consumer segment includes lawn and garden tractors, compact
utility tractors, residential and commercial zero-turn radius mowers, front
mowers, utility vehicles, and golf and turf equipment. A broad line of
associated implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating,
and many other residential, commercial, golf and sports turf care applications
are also included. The product line also includes walk-behind mowers and other
outdoor power products. Retail sales of these commercial and consumer equipment
products are influenced by weather conditions, consumer spending patterns and
general economic conditions. To increase asset turnover and reduce the average
level of field inventories through the year, the production and shipment
schedules of the commercial and consumer equipment segment’s product lines
closely correspond to the seasonal pattern of retail sales.

The commercial and consumer segment
manufactures and sells certain equipment attachments under the Frontier brand
name, and manufactures and sells walk-behind mowers and scarifiers in Europe
under the SABO brand, as well as the John Deere brand. The segment also builds
products for sale by mass retailers, including The Home Depot and Lowe’s.

John Deere Landscapes, Inc., a unit of
the segment, distributes irrigation equipment, nursery products and landscape
supplies, including seed, fertilizer and hardscape materials, primarily to
landscape service professionals. In 2007, John Deere acquired LESCO, Inc.,
expanding its customer base for these products.

In addition to the equipment manufactured by
the commercial and consumer equipment segment, John Deere purchases certain
products from other manufacturers for resale.

Seasonality.

Retail
demand for the segment’s equipment normally is higher in the second and third
quarters. The commercial and consumer equipment segment is pursuing a strategy
of building and shipping as close to retail demand as possible. Consequently,


production, shipping and retail sales
normally will be proportionately higher in the second and third quarters of
each year.

Construction and Forestry

John Deere construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry
equipment includes a broad range of backhoe loaders, crawler dozers and
loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, motor graders, articulated dump
trucks, landscape loaders, skid-steer loaders, log skidders, log feller
bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and a variety of
attachments.

Today, the construction and forestry segment provides sizes of
equipment that compete for over 90 percent of the estimated total North
American market for those categories of construction, earthmoving and material
handling equipment in which it competes. This segment also provides the most
complete line of forestry machines and attachments available in the world.
These forestry machines and attachments are distributed under the John Deere,
Timberjack and Waratah brand names. In addition to the equipment manufactured
by the construction and forestry segment, John Deere purchases certain products
from other manufacturers for resale.

The prevailing levels of residential, commercial and public
construction and the condition of the forest products industry influence retail
sales of John Deere construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry
equipment. General economic conditions, the level of interest rates,
availability of credit and certain commodity prices such as those applicable to
pulp, paper and saw logs also influence sales.

John Deere and Hitachi have a joint venture for the manufacture of
hydraulic excavators and track log loaders in the United States and Canada.
John Deere also distributes Hitachi brands of construction and mining equipment
in North, Central and South America. John Deere also has supply agreements with
Hitachi under which a range of construction, earthmoving, material handling and
forestry products manufactured by John Deere in the United States, Finland and
New Zealand are distributed by Hitachi in certain Asian markets.

In 2008, John
Deere expanded this segment’s business outside of the United States and Canada
by entering into two joint ventures, one in China and one in India. John Deere
entered into a joint venture with Xuzhou Bohui Science & Technology
Development CO. Ltd. (“Xuzhou”) by purchasing a 50% ownership interest in
Xuzhou’s wholly-owned excavator manufacturing subsidiary, Xuzhou Xuwa Excavator
Machinery CO. Ltd. (now known as Xuzhou XCG John Deere Machinery Manufacturing
Co., Ltd. (“Xuzhou XCG”)). John Deere also signed an agreement to form a joint
venture with Ashok Leyland Limited in India (Ashok Leyland John Deere
Construction Equipment Company Private Limited)

for the manufacture of
backhoes and four-wheel drive loaders.

The segment has a number of initiatives in the rent-to-rent, or
short-term rental, market for construction, earthmoving and material handling
equipment. These include specially designed rental programs for John Deere
dealers and expanded cooperation with major, national equipment rental
companies.

John Deere also owns Nortrax, Inc.,
Nortrax Investments, Inc. and Nortrax Canada Inc. (formerly known as
Ontrac Equipment Services, Inc.) (collectively called Nortrax). Nortrax is
an authorized John Deere dealer for construction, earthmoving, material
handling and forestry equipment in a variety of markets in the United States
and Canada.

Engineering and Research

John Deere invests heavily in engineering and
research to improve the quality and performance of its products, and to develop
new products. Such expenditures were $943 million or 3.7 percent of net sales
of equipment in 2008, $817 million or 3.8 percent in 2007, and $726 million or
3.7 percent in 2006.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing Plants

.
In the United States and Canada, the Equipment Operations own and operate 18
factory locations and lease and operate another four locations, which contain
approximately 27.3 million square feet of floor space. Of these 22 factories,
13 are devoted primarily to agricultural equipment, four to commercial and
consumer equipment, two to construction and forestry equipment, and one engine
and two hydraulic and power train component facilities. Outside the United
States and Canada, the Equipment Operations own or lease and operate:
agricultural equipment factories in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India,
Mexico, the Netherlands and Russia; engine factories in Argentina, France,
India and Mexico; a component factory in Spain; a commercial and consumer
equipment factory in Germany and forestry equipment factories in Finland and
New Zealand. In addition, John Deere Water Technologies has manufacturing
operations outside of North America in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile,
Ecuador, Israel and Spain. These factories and manufacturing operations outside
the United States and Canada contain approximately 15.2 million square feet of
floor space. The Equipment Operations also have financial interests in other
manufacturing organizations, which include agricultural equipment manufacturers
in the United States, an industrial truck manufacturer in South Africa, the
Hitachi joint venture that builds hydraulic excavators and track log loaders in
the United States and Canada, the Xuzhou XCG joint venture that builds
excavators and ventures that manufacture transaxles and transmissions used in
certain commercial and consumer equipment segment products.


The engine factories referred to above
manufacture non-road, heavy duty diesel engines a majority of which are
manufactured for the Company’s Equipment Operations; the remaining engines are
sold to other regional and global original equipment manufacturers.

John Deere’s facilities are well maintained,
in good operating condition and are suitable for their present purposes. These
facilities, together with both short-term and long-term planned capital
expenditures, are expected to meet John Deere’s manufacturing needs in the
foreseeable future.

Capacity is adequate to satisfy the Company’s
current expectations for retail market demand. The Equipment Operations’
manufacturing strategy involves the implementation of appropriate levels of
technology and automation to allow manufacturing processes to remain profitable
at varying production levels. Operations are also designed to be flexible
enough to accommodate the product design changes required to meet market
conditions. Common manufacturing facilities and techniques are employed in the
production of components for agricultural, commercial and consumer and
construction and forestry equipment.

In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more
effectively, the Equipment Operations pursue continuous improvements in
manufacturing processes. These include steps to streamline manufacturing
processes and enhance responsiveness to customers. The Company has implemented
flexible assembly lines that can handle a wider product mix and deliver
products when dealers and customers require them. Additionally, considerable
effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process
improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing technology, enhanced
environmental management systems, supply management and logistics as well as
compensation incentives related to productivity and organizational structure.
The Company is experiencing volatility in the price of many raw materials. The
Company has offset, and expects to continue to offset, any increased costs
through the above-described cost reduction measures and through pricing.
Significant cost increases, if they occur, could have an adverse effect on the
Company’s operating results. The Equipment Operations also pursue external
sales of selected parts and components that can be manufactured and supplied to
third parties on a competitive basis.

Capital
Expenditures.

The Equipment Operations’ capital
expenditures totaled $781 million in 2008, compared with $575 million in 2007,
and $481 million in 2006. Provisions for depreciation applicable to these
operations’ property, plant and equipment during these years were $432 million,
$389 million, and $370 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for the
Equipment Operations in 2009 are currently estimated to be approximately $1
billion. The 2009 expenditures will relate primarily to the modernization and
restructuring of key manufacturing facilities and will also relate to the
development of new products. Future levels of capital expenditures will depend
on business conditions.

Patents and Trademarks

John Deere owns a significant number of
patents, licenses and trademarks. The Company believes that, in the aggregate,
the rights under these patents, licenses and trademarks are generally important
to its operations, but does not consider that any patent, license, trademark or
related group of them (other than its house trademarks, which include but are
not limited to the “John Deere” mark, the leaping deer logo, the “Nothing Runs
Like a Deere” slogan and green and yellow equipment colors) is of material
importance in relation to John Deere’s business.

Marketing

In the United States and Canada, the
Equipment Operations distribute equipment and service parts through the
following facilities (collectively called sales branches): one agricultural
equipment and one commercial and consumer equipment sales and administration
office each supported by seven agricultural equipment and commercial and
consumer equipment sales branches; and one construction, earthmoving, material
handling and forestry equipment sales and administration office.

In addition, the Equipment Operations operate
a centralized parts distribution warehouse in coordination with several
regional parts depots and distribution centers in the United States and Canada
and have an agreement with a third party to operate a high-volume parts
warehouse in Indiana.

The sales branches in the United States and
Canada market John Deere products at approximately 2,752 dealer locations, most
of which are independently owned. Of these, approximately 1,567 sell
agricultural equipment, while 517 sell construction, earthmoving, material
handling and/or forestry equipment. Nortrax owns some of the 517 locations.
Commercial and consumer equipment is sold by most John Deere agricultural
equipment dealers, a few construction, earthmoving, material handling and
forestry equipment dealers, and about 650 commercial and consumer equipment
dealers, many of which also handle competitive brands and dissimilar lines of
products. In addition, certain lawn and garden product lines are sold through
The Home Depot and Lowe’s.

John Deere Landscapes operates its business
from 612 branch locations throughout the United States and Canada, along with
94 “Stores-on-Wheels.”

Outside the United States and Canada, John
Deere agricultural equipment is sold to distributors and dealers for resale in
over 100 countries. Sales branches are located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Germany, France, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa,
Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. Export sales
branches are located in Europe


and the United States. Associated companies
doing business in China also sell agricultural equipment. Commercial and
consumer equipment sales outside the United States and Canada occur primarily
in Europe and Australia. Construction, earthmoving, material handling and
forestry equipment is sold to distributors and dealers primarily by sales offices
located in the United States, Brazil, Finland and Singapore. Some of these
dealers are independently owned while the Company owns others.

John Deere Water Technologies operates from
29 sales and marketing locations and 16 warehousing locations in 14 countries
including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Columbia, Ecuador,
France, Israel, Peru, the Philippines, Spain, Turkey and the United States. Its
products are marketed through approximately 1,500 dealers and distributors in
over 100 countries.

John Deere engines are marketed worldwide through select sales branches
to large original equipment manufacturers and independently owned engine
distributors.

Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable

Trade accounts and notes receivable arise primarily from sales of goods
to independent dealers. Most trade receivables originated by the Equipment
Operations are purchased by Financial Services. The Equipment Operations
compensate Financial Services at market rates of interest for these
receivables. Additional information appears in Note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

Credit Operations

United States and Canada

.
The Company’s credit segment (collectively referred to as the Credit Companies)
primarily provide and administer financing for retail purchases from John Deere
dealers of new equipment manufactured by the Company’s agricultural equipment,
commercial and consumer equipment, and construction and forestry divisions and
used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. The Company and John Deere
Construction & Forestry Company are referred to as the “sales
companies.” John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a United
States credit subsidiary, generally purchases retail installment sales and loan
contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. These retail notes are
acquired by the sales companies through John Deere retail dealers in the United
States. John Deere Credit Inc., a Canadian credit subsidiary, purchases and
finances retail notes acquired by John Deere Limited, the Company’s Canadian
sales branch. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the Credit
Companies acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by
agreements with the sales companies. The Credit Companies also finance and service
revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through
merchants in the agricultural, commercial and consumer and construction and
forestry markets (revolving charge accounts). Further, the Credit Companies
finance and service operating loans, in most cases offered through and acquired
from farm input providers or through direct relationships with agricultural
producers or agribusinesses (operating loans). Additionally, the Credit
Companies provide wholesale financing for inventories of John Deere
agricultural, commercial and consumer, and construction and forestry equipment
owned by dealers of those products (wholesale notes). In the United States,
certain Company subsidiaries included in the credit segment also offer certain
crop risk mitigation products, and invest in wind energy generation.

Retail notes acquired by the sales companies
are immediately sold to the Credit Companies. The Equipment Operations are the
Credit Companies’ major source of business, but many retail purchasers of John
Deere products finance their purchases outside the John Deere organization.

The Credit Companies offer retail leases to
equipment users in the United States. A small number of leases are executed
with units of local government. Leases are usually written for periods of two
to five years, and frequently contain an option permitting the customer to
purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail leases are also
offered in a generally similar manner to customers in Canada through John Deere
Credit Inc. and John Deere Limited.

The Credit Companies’ terms for financing
equipment retail sales (other than smaller items financed with unsecured
revolving charge accounts) provide for retention of a security interest in the
equipment financed. The Credit Companies’ guidelines for minimum down payments,
which vary with the types of equipment and repayment provisions, are generally
not less than 20 percent on agricultural equipment, 10 percent on construction
and forestry equipment and 10 percent on lawn and grounds care equipment used
for personal use. Finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or
reduced on certain John Deere products sold or leased in advance of the season
of use or in other sales promotions. The Credit Companies generally receive
compensation from the sales companies equal to a competitive interest rate for
periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes
or leases. The cost is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by
the Equipment Operations.

The Company has an agreement with the Capital Corporation to make
income maintenance payments to the Capital Corporation such that its ratio of
earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any fiscal quarter.
For 2008 and 2007, the Capital Corporation’s ratios were 1.52 to 1 and 1.54 to
1, respectively, and never less than 1.43 to 1 and 1.54 to 1 for any fiscal
quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company has also committed to
continue to own at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of
the Capital Corporation and to maintain the Capital Corporation’s consolidated
tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. The Company’s obligations to
make payments to the Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of
whether the Capital


Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other
liabilities. Further, the Company’s obligations under the agreement are not
measured by the amount of the Capital Corporation’s indebtedness, obligations
or other liabilities. The Company’s obligations to make payments under this
agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific
indebtedness, obligation or liability of the Capital Corporation and are
enforceable only by or in the name of the Capital Corporation. No payments were
required under this agreement in 2008 or 2007.

Outside the United States and Canada

.
The Credit Companies also offer financing, primarily for John Deere products,
in Australia, New Zealand, Russia, and in several countries in Europe and in
Latin America. In certain areas, financing is offered through cooperation
agreements or joint ventures. Financing outside of the United States and Canada
is affected by a variety of customs and regulations.

The Credit Companies also offer to select customers and dealers credit
enhanced international export financing for the purchase of John Deere
products.

Capital Expenditures

.
The Credit operations’ capital expenditures totaled $337 million in 2008,
compared with $450 million in 2007, and $292 million in 2006. Provisions for
depreciation applicable to these operations’ property, plant and equipment
during these years were $34 million, $13 million, and $8 million respectively.
Capital expenditures for the credit operations in 2009 are currently estimated
to be approximately $125 million. The increases in capital expenditures since
2004 have related primarily to wind energy generation.

Additional information on the Credit Companies appears on pages 16,
17, 19 and 21.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Company is subject to a wide variety of state, federal and
international environmental laws, rules and regulations. These laws, rules and
regulations may affect the way the Company conducts its operations, and failure
to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties. The
Company is also involved in the evaluation and clean-up of a limited number of
sites. Management does not expect that these matters will have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows of the Company. With respect to acquired properties and businesses,
the Company cannot be certain that it has identified all adverse environmental
conditions. The Company expects that it will acquire additional properties and
businesses in the future.

EMPLOYEES

At October 31, 2008, John Deere had
approximately 56,700 full-time employees, including approximately 31,700
employees in the United States and Canada. From time to time, John Deere also
retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time
workers. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 36

percent of John Deere’s United States employees. Most of
the Company’s United States production and maintenance workers are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW), with an
expiration date of September 30, 2009.

Unions also represent the majority of
employees at John Deere manufacturing facilities outside the United States.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

Following are the names and ages of the
executive officers of the Company, their positions with the Company and
summaries of their backgrounds and business experience. All executive officers
are elected or appointed by the Board of Directors and hold office until the
annual meeting of the Board of Directors following the annual meeting of
stockholders in each year.


ITEM 1A.              RISK
FACTORS.

Governmental Actions

. The Company’s agricultural business is exposed to a
variety of risks and uncertainties related to the action or inaction of
governmental bodies. The outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices
of the World Trade Organization could have a material effect on the
international flow of agricultural commodities which may result in a
corresponding effect on the demand for agricultural equipment in many areas of
the world. The policies of the Brazilian government (including those related to
exchange rates and commodity prices) and Argentine government could
significantly change the dynamics of the agricultural economy in South America.
With respect to the current global economic downturn, changes in governmental
banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase the
availability of credit may not be effective and could have a material impact on
the Company’s customers and markets.

In addition, to the extent that the Company participates in
governmental programs designed to address current conditions, both in the U.S.
and outside the U.S., there is no assurance such programs will remain available
for sufficient periods of time or on acceptable terms to benefit the Company,
and the expiration of such programs could have unintended adverse effects. In
addition, certain competitors may be eligible for certain programs that the
Company is ineligible for, which may create a competitive disadvantage.

The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) was
signed into law on October 3, 2008 to stabilize and provide liquidity to
U.S. financial markets. There can be no assurance as to the actual impact of
the implementing regulations of the EESA, or any other governmental program, on
the financial markets. The Company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations, access to credit, and trading price of common stock could be
materially and adversely affected if the financial markets fail to stabilize,
or if current financial market conditions worsen.


The Company may also become subject to additional restrictions pursuant
to participation in the EESA’s specific programs. For example, John Deere’s
participation in the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program will require
the payment of certain fees to the FDIC. The costs of participation or
non-participation in any such program, as well as the effect of such programs
on the Company’s results of operations, cannot be reliably determined at this
time.

Changing Demand for Farm Outputs

.
Changing worldwide demand for food and the demand for different forms of
bio-energy could have an effect on prices for farm commodities and consequently
the demand for the Company’s agricultural equipment. In addition, global
economic conditions may have an impact on commodity prices.

Globalization

. The
continuing globalization of agricultural businesses may significantly change
the dynamics of the Company’s competition, customer base and product offerings.
The Company’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent on access
to, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in,
additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, Russia,
India and China. In some cases, these countries have greater political and
economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor
disruptions. Operating in a large number of different regions and countries
exposes the Company to multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to
change; increased exposure to currency fluctuations; differing local product
preferences and product requirements; differing labor regulations and differing
tax laws. Simultaneously, these emerging markets are becoming more competitive
as other international companies grow globally and local low cost manufacturers
expand their production capacities.

Economic Condition and Outlook

. Recent significant changes in market
liquidity conditions could impact access to funding and associated funding
costs, which could reduce the Company’s earnings and cash flows. The Company’s
investment management operations could be adversely impacted by changes in the
equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. General
economic conditions can affect the demand for the Company’s equipment. Current
negative economic conditions and outlook have decreased housing starts and
other construction and dampened demand for certain construction equipment. The
Company’s commercial and consumer equipment and construction and forestry
segments are dependent on construction activity and general economic
conditions. A significant or prolonged decline in construction activity and
housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations if current economic difficulties, as well as depressed housing markets,
continue into the foreseeable future. If current economic conditions extend to
the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on agricultural
equipment sales.

The volatility in global financial markets has reached unprecedented
levels. Global financial market downturns began in the second half of 2007, and
significantly increased during the fourth quarter of 2008. Volatile oil prices,
falling equity market values, declining business, weakened consumer confidence,
and risks of increased inflation and deflation and increased unemployment rates
have created fears of a severe recession. Conditions in the global financial
markets and general economy materially affect the Company’s results of
operations. The demand for the Company’s products and services could be
adversely affected in an economic crisis characterized by higher unemployment,
lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, and lower business
investment.

Currency Fluctuations

.
The reporting currency for the Company’s consolidated financial statements is
the U.S. dollar. Certain of the Company’s assets, liabilities, expenses and
revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies. Those assets,
liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the
applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the
U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as
reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, even if their
value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in
the value of the U.S. dollar could have a continuing and significant impact on
the Company’s results.

Risks to Financial Services Segment

. The current economic downturn and
market volatility have adversely affected the financial industry in which the
credit segment operates. The credit segment provides financing to a significant
portion of John Deere sales worldwide. The credit segment’s inability to access
funds to support its financing activities to the Company’s customers could have
a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The credit segment’s
liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital
to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs
associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. In recent weeks,
the credit markets have reached unprecedented levels of volatility, resulting
in reduced levels of liquidity and disruption of domestic and foreign financial
markets. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or
worsen, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, under
current market conditions customer confidence levels may result in declines in
credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which
could materially impact the credit segment’s write-offs and provisions for
credit losses.

Consumer Attitudes

.
The confidence the Company’s customers have in the general economic outlook can
have a significant effect on their propensity to purchase equipment and,
consequently, on the Company’s sales. Current negative economic conditions
could significantly impair customer confidence. The Company’s ability to match its
new product offerings to its customers’ anticipated preferences for enhanced
technologies and different types and sizes of equipment is important as well.


Weather.

Poor or
unusual weather conditions, particularly in the spring, can significantly
affect the purchasing decisions of the Company’s customers, particularly the
customers of the agricultural and commercial and consumer segments. Sales in
the important spring selling season can have a dramatic effect on the
commercial and consumer segment’s financial results.

Supply Base and Raw Material Costs

.
Many of the Company’s suppliers also supply the automotive industry. The severe
downturn in automotive sales and the weak financial condition of some major
automakers could cause these suppliers to face severe financial hardship and
disrupt the Company’s access to critical components. Changes in the
availability and price of raw materials, which are more likely to occur during
times of economic volatility, could have a material negative impact on the
Company’s costs of production and, in turn, on the profitability of the
business.

Interest Rates and Credit Ratings

.
If interest rates rise, they could have a dampening effect on overall economic
activity and could affect the demand for the Company’s equipment. In addition,
credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very
important to the Company’s credit segment. Decisions and actions by credit
rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of funding for the
Company. Credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can
increase the Company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.
Guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect the Company’s
returns as well.

Environmental.

The Company’s operations are subject to
and affected by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations by
federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory
authorities with jurisdiction over the Company’s foreign operations.
Violations of such laws or regulations can lead to investigation and
remediation costs, significant fines or penalties. In addition, increased
requirements of governmental authorities, and claims for damages to property or
injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health or safety impacts of
the Company’s operations or past contamination, could prevent or restrict the
Company’s operations, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance,
involve the imposition of cleanup liens and/or give rise to civil or criminal
liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or
regulations, which could result in enforcement actions or private claims would
not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business, financial condition or results of operations.

Climate Change.

There is a growing
political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”)
continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are
affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. Various
stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and
non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors
are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. There is growing consensus that
some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level with respect
to greenhouse gas emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of
additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances. The impact of any
future mandatory GHG legislative or regulatory requirements on the Company’s
businesses and products is dependent on the design of the mandate, and so the
Company is unable to predict its significance at this time.

Furthermore,
the potential physical impacts of climate change on the Company’s customers,
and therefore on the Company’s operations, are highly uncertain, and will be
particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions.
These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall
levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature
levels. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost, production
and financial performance of John Deere’s operations.

The risks identified above should be
considered in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis beginning
on page 15 and, specifically, the other risks described in the Safe Harbor
Statement on pages 17 and 18. The Company’s results of operations may be
affected by these identified risks and/or by risks not currently contemplated.

STAFF COMMENTS.

None.

ITEM 2.                  PROPERTIES.

See “Manufacturing” in Item 1.

The Equipment Operations own 14 facilities
housing sales branches, one centralized parts depot, regional parts depots,
training centers, transfer houses and warehouses throughout the United States
and Canada. These facilities contain approximately 4.3 million square feet of
floor space. The Equipment Operations also own and occupy buildings housing
sales branches, one centralized parts depot and regional parts depots in
Australia, Brazil, Europe and New Zealand. These facilities contain
approximately 1.0 million square feet of floor space.

Deere & Company administrative
offices and research facilities, all of which are owned by John Deere, together
contain about 2.6 million square feet of floor space and miscellaneous other
facilities total 1.0 million square feet.


Overall, the Company owns approximately 48.8
million square feet of facilities and leases approximately 12.4 million
additional square feet in various locations.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is subject to various unresolved
legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most
prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos-related
liability), retail credit, software licensing, patent and trademark matters. Although
it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved
legal actions or the range of possible loss, the Company believes these
unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect on its financial
statements.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Deere & Company’s internal control system was
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be


effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2008, using the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of October 31,
2008, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. That
report is included herein.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2008,
2007 AND 2006

OVERVIEW

Organization

The
company’s Equipment Operations generate revenues and cash primarily from the
sale of equipment to John Deere dealers and distributors. The Equipment
Operations manufacture and distribute a full line of agricultural equipment; a
variety of commercial, consumer and landscapes equipment and products; and a
broad range of equipment for construction and forestry. The company’s Financial
Services primarily provide credit services, which mainly finance sales and
leases of equipment

by
John Deere dealers and trade receivables purchased from the Equipment
Operations. In addition, Financial Services offer certain crop risk mitigation
products and invest in wind energy
generation. The information in the following discussion is presented in a
format that includes information grouped as consolidated, Equipment Operations
and Financial Services. The company also views its operations as consisting of
two geographic areas, the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S. and Canada.

Trends and Economic Conditions

Demand
for productive agricultural machinery has continued to be strong due in large
part to the financial health of the farm sector. Industry sales of farm
machinery in the U.S. and Canada in 2009 are expected to be up about 5 percent
for the year, led by an increase in large tractors and combines. Industry sales
in Western Europe are forecast to be down 5 to 10 percent.  Sales in South American markets are expected
to be down 10 to 20 percent in 2009. The company’s agricultural equipment net
sales were up 37 percent for 2008 and are forecast to be up approximately 5
percent in 2009. The company’s commercial and consumer equipment net sales were
up 2 percent in 2008, including an increase of about 6 percent from a
landscapes acquisition in May 2007. Commercial and consumer equipment
sales are forecast to be down about 6 percent in 2009, reflecting the U.S.
housing decline and recessionary economic conditions. U.S. markets for
construction and forestry equipment are forecast to remain under pressure in
2009 due to further deterioration in the housing sector, declines in
nonresidential construction and negative economic growth. The company’s
construction and forestry net sales decreased 4 percent in 2008 and are
forecast to be down approximately 12 percent in 2009. Net income for the
company’s credit operations in 2009 is expected to decrease to approximately
$300 million.

Items
of concern include the sharp downturn in global economic activity and the
turmoil in financial markets. Significant fluctuations in currency translation
rates could also impact the company’s results. The volatility in the price of
many commodities used in the company’s products are a concern. Escalating
prices driven by global demand impacted the results of the company’s equipment
operations during 2008. The availability of certain components that could
impact the company’s ability to meet production schedules continues to

be monitored. The availability and price of
food may prompt changes in
renewable fuel standards that could affect commodity prices. Producing engines
that continue to meet high performance standards, yet also comply with
increasingly stringent emissions regulations is one of the company’s major
priorities.

In
spite of the present economic situation, the company remains encouraged by its
growth prospects and believes that trends favorable to its businesses remain
intact. These trends include increasing global demand for farm commodities and
renewable fuels, as well as a growing need over time for housing and
infrastructure.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Worldwide
net income in 2008 was $2,053 million, or $4.70 per share diluted ($4.76
basic), compared with $1,822 million, or $4.00 per share diluted ($4.05 basic),
in 2007. Net sales

and
revenues increased 18 percent to $28,438 million in 2008, compared with $24,082
million in 2007. Net sales of the Equipment Operations increased 20 percent in
2008 to $25,803 million from $21,489 million last year. This included a
positive effect for currency translation of 4 percent and price changes of 2
percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 9 percent in 2008. Net
sales outside the U.S. and Canada increased by 40 percent, which included a positive effect of 10 percent for currency
translation.

Worldwide
Equipment Operations had an operating profit of $2,927 million in 2008,
compared with $2,318 million in 2007. Higher operating profit was primarily due
to the favorable impact of higher shipment volumes and improved price
realization. Partially offsetting these factors were increased raw material
costs, higher selling, administrative and general expenses, increased research
and development costs and expenses to close a facility in Canada (see Note 3).

The
Equipment Operations’ net income was $1,676 million in 2008, compared with
$1,429 million in 2007. The same operating factors mentioned above as well as a
higher effective tax rate this year affected these results.

Net
income of the company’s Financial Services

operations in 2008 decreased to $337 million,
compared with $364 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily a result of
increased selling, administrative and general expenses, an increase in average
leverage and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by growth
in the average credit portfolio. Additional information is presented in the
following discussion of the credit operations.

The
cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2008 was 75.9 percent, compared with 75.6
percent last year. The increase was primarily due to higher raw material costs,
partially offset by higher sales and production volumes and improved price
realization.

Other
income increased this year primarily from

increased crop insurance commissions. Research and development costs
increased primarily due to increased spending in support of new products, Tier
4 emission requirements and the effect of currency translation. Selling,
administrative and general expenses increased primarily due to growth and
acquisitions, the effect of currency translation and the provision for credit
losses.


Other
operating expenses were higher primarily as a result of higher expenses related
to wind energy entities, expenses from crop insurance, depreciation on
operating lease equipment and foreign exchange losses.

The
company has several defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health
care and life insurance plans. The company’s postretirement benefit costs for
these plans in 2008 were $277 million, compared with $415 million in 2007. The
long-term expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs,
was an expected gain of 8.2 percent

in 2008 and 8.3 percent in 2007, or $920 million in 2008 and $838
million in 2007. The actual return was a loss of $2,158 million in 2008 and a
gain of $1,503 million in 2007. In 2009, the expected return will be
approximately 8.2 percent. The company expects postretirement benefit costs in
2009 to be approximately the same as 2008. The company makes any required
contributions to the plan assets under applicable regulations and voluntary
contributions from time to time based on the company’s liquidity and ability to
make tax-deductible contributions. Total company contributions to the plans
were $431 million in 2008 and $646 million in 2007, which include direct
benefit payments for unfunded plans. These contributions also included
voluntary contributions to total plan assets of approximately $297 million in
2008 and $520 million in 2007. Total company contributions in 2009 are expected
to be approximately $168 million, which are primarily direct benefit payments.
The company has no significant contributions to pension plan assets required in
2009 under applicable funding regulations. See the following discussion of “Critical
Accounting Policies” for more information about postretirement benefit
obligations.

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS

The
following discussion relates to operating results by reportable segment and
geographic area. Operating profit is income before external interest expense,
certain foreign

exchange
gains or losses, income taxes and corporate expenses. However, operating profit
of the credit segment includes the effect of interest expense and foreign
exchange gains or losses.

Worldwide Agricultural Equipment Operations

The
agricultural equipment segment had an operating profit of $2,224 million in
2008, compared with $1,443 million in 2007. Net sales increased 37 percent this
year due to higher shipment volumes, the favorable effects of currency
translation and

improved
price realization. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher
shipment volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by higher raw
material costs, increased selling, administrative and general expenses, higher
research and development costs and expenses to close a facility in Canada.

Worldwide Commercial and Consumer Equipment Operations

The
commercial and consumer equipment segment had an operating profit of $237
million in 2008, compared with $304 million in 2007. Net sales increased 2
percent for the year, which included 6 percent from a landscapes operation
acquired in May 2007. The decline in operating profit was primarily

due to higher selling,
administrative and general expenses in the landscapes operation, increased raw
material costs and expenses to close the previously mentioned Canadian
facility. Partially offsetting these items were improved price realization and
a more favorable product mix.

Worldwide Construction and Forestry Operations

The
construction and forestry segment had an operating profit of $466 million in
2008, compared with $571 million in 2007. Net sales decreased 4 percent for the
year reflecting the pressure from U.S. market conditions. The operating profit
was lower primarily due to lower shipment volumes and higher raw material
costs, partially offset by improved price realization.

Worldwide Credit Operations

The
operating profit of the credit operations was $478 million in 2008, compared
with $548 million in 2007. The decrease in operating profit was primarily due
to higher selling, administrative and general expenses, an increase in average
leverage, a higher provision for credit losses and foreign exchange losses,
partially offset by growth in the average credit portfolio and increased
commissions from crop insurance. Total revenues

of the credit operations, including
intercompany revenues, increased 3 percent in 2008, primarily reflecting the
larger portfolio. The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 6
percent higher in 2008, compared with 2007. An increase in average borrowings,
offset by lower average interest rates, resulted in approximately the same
interest expense in both 2008 and 2007. The credit operations’ ratio of
earnings to fixed charges was 1.45 to 1 in 2008, compared with 1.55 to 1 in
2007.

Equipment Operations in U.S. and Canada

The
equipment operations in the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $1,831
million in 2008, compared with $1,539 million in 2007. The increase was
primarily due to higher shipment volumes and improved price realization,
partially offset by higher raw material costs, increased selling, administrative
and general expenses, higher research and development costs and expenses to
close the previously mentioned Canadian facility. Net sales increased 9 percent
due to higher volumes, improved price realization and the favorable effects of
currency translation. The physical volume increased

4 percent excluding acquisitions, compared
with 2007.

Equipment Operations outside U.S. and Canada

The
equipment operations outside the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of
$1,096 million in 2008, compared with $779 million in 2007. The increase was
primarily due to the effects of higher shipment volumes and improved price
realization, partially offset by increases in raw material costs,

increased selling, administrative and general
expenses and higher research and development costs. Net sales were 40 percent
higher reflecting higher volumes, the effect of currency translation and
improvements in price realization. The physical volume increased 27 percent
excluding acquisitions, compared with 2007.


MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK

Given
the sudden, sharp downturn in global economic activity, and the ongoing turmoil
in world financial markets, the outlook for the year ahead is highly uncertain
and its impact on the company’s operations is difficult to assess. Subject to
the economic uncertainties, company equipment sales are projected to be about
the same for the full year of 2009 and up about

7 percent for the first quarter, compared to
the same periods in 2008. Included in the forecast is a negative currency
translation impact of about 6 percent for both the full year and first quarter.
The company’s net income is forecast to be about $1.9 billion for 2009 and
about $275 million for the first quarter.

Agricultural Equipment.

Worldwide sales of the company’s
agricultural equipment are forecast to increase by about 5 percent for
full-year 2009. This includes a negative currency translation impact of about 8
percent.

Farm
machinery industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be up about 5
percent for the year, led by an increase in large tractors and combines. The
company expects agricultural commodity prices to remain at healthy levels in

2009, though below the previous
year, while costs moderate for key inputs such as fuel and fertilizer. Sales of
cotton equipment, small tractors, and equipment commonly used by livestock
producers are expected to be lower.

Industry
sales in Western Europe are forecast to be down 5 to 10 percent for the year.
Sales are expected to be down moderately in Central Europe and the CIS
(Commonwealth of Independent States) countries, including Russia. While demand
in these areas for highly productive farm equipment remains good, sales will
depend on the availability and cost of credit. Sales in South American markets
are expected to be down

to 20 percent in 2009, with the decline related to credit access in Brazil and
drought conditions in Argentina.

Commercial and Consumer Equipment.

Reflecting the U.S. housing market decline
and recessionary economic conditions, the company’s commercial and consumer
equipment sales are projected to be down about 6 percent for the year. The
segment expects sales gains from new products to partly offset the impact of
the economic decline.

Construction and Forestry.

U.S. markets for construction and forestry
equipment are forecast to remain under pressure due to further deterioration in
the already weakened housing sector, a steep decline in nonresidential
construction, and negative economic growth. The global economic slowdown is expected to lead to a lower level of
forestry equipment sales in both the U.S. and Europe. Subject to the economic
uncertainties discussed earlier, the company’s worldwide sales of construction
and forestry equipment are forecast to decline by approximately 12 percent for
the year. Despite the poor economic
climate, company sales are expected to benefit from innovative new products.

Credit.

Subject to the uncertainty associated with present economic conditions,
net income for 2009 for the company’s credit operations is forecast to be
approximately $300 million. The forecast decrease from 2008 is primarily due to
narrower financing spreads related to the current funding environment.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995:

Statements under “Overview,” “Market Conditions and Outlook” and other
statements herein that relate to future operating periods are subject to
important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines
of business, while others could affect all of the company’s businesses.

Forward
looking statements involve certain factors that are subject to change, including
for the company’s agricultural equipment segment the many interrelated factors
that affect

farmers’
confidence. These factors include worldwide economic conditions, demand for
agricultural products, world grain stocks, weather conditions, soil conditions,
harvest yields, prices for commodities and livestock, crop and livestock
production expenses, availability of transport for crops, the growth of
non-food uses for some crops (including ethanol and bio-energy production),
real estate values, available acreage for farming, the land ownership policies of various
governments, changes in government farm programs and policies (including those
in the U.S. and Brazil), international reaction to such programs, global trade
agreements, animal diseases and their effects on poultry and beef consumption and prices (including
avian flu and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as “mad cow”
disease), crop pests and diseases (including Asian rust), and the level of farm
product exports (including concerns about genetically modified organisms).

Factors
affecting the outlook for the company’s commercial and consumer equipment
segment include weather conditions, general economic conditions, customer
profitability, consumer confidence, consumer borrowing patterns, consumer
purchasing preferences, housing starts, infrastructure investment, spending by
municipalities and golf courses, and consumable input costs.

General
economic conditions, consumer spending patterns, real estate and housing
prices, the number of housing starts and interest rates are especially
important to sales of the company’s construction equipment. The levels of
public and non-residential construction also impact the results of the company’s
construction and forestry segment. Prices for pulp, lumber and structural
panels are important to sales of forestry equipment.

All
of the company’s businesses and its reported results

are affected by general economic conditions
in, and the political and social stability of, the global markets in which the
company operates, especially material changes in economic activity in these
markets; customer confidence in the general economic conditions; capital market
disruptions; significant changes in capital market liquidity, access to capital
and associated funding costs; changes in and the impact of governmental
banking, monetary and fiscal policies and governmental programs in particular
jurisdictions or for the benefit of certain sectors; actions by rating
agencies; customer access to capital for purchases of our products and
borrowing and repayment practices, the number and size of customer loan
delinquencies and defaults, and the sub-prime credit market crises; changes in
the market values of investment assets; production, design and technological
difficulties, including capacity and supply constraints and prices; the
availability and prices of strategically


sourced
materials, components and whole goods; delays or disruptions in the company’s
supply chain due to weather, natural disasters or financial hardship of
suppliers; start-up of new plants and new products; the success of new product
initiatives and customer acceptance of new products; oil and energy prices and
supplies; inflation and deflation rates, interest rates and foreign currency
exchange rates, especially fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar; the
availability and cost of freight; trade, monetary and fiscal policies of
various countries, wars and other international conflicts and the threat
thereof; actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other central banks;
actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; actions by
environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies, including those related
to engine emissions (in particular Tier 4 emission requirements), noise and the
risk of global warming; actions by other regulatory bodies; actions of
competitors in the various industries in which the company competes,
particularly price discounting; dealer practices especially as to levels of new
and used field inventories; labor relations and regulations; changes to
accounting standards; changes in tax rates and regulations; the effects of, or
response to, terrorism; and changes in laws and regulations affecting the
sectors in which the company operates. The spread of major epidemics (including
influenza, SARS, fevers and other viruses) also could affect company results.
Changes in weather patterns could impact customer operations and company
results. Company results are also affected by changes in the level of employee
retirement benefits, changes in market values of investment assets and the
level of interest rates, which impact retirement benefit costs,

and significant changes in health care costs.
Other factors that could affect results are acquisitions and divestitures of
businesses; the integration of new businesses; changes in company declared
dividends and common stock issuances and repurchases.

With
respect to the current global economic downturn, changes in governmental banking,
monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase the availability
of credit may not be effective and could have a material impact on the company’s
customers and markets. Recent significant changes in market liquidity
conditions could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which
could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows. The company’s investment
management operations could be impaired by changes in the equity and bond
markets, which would negatively affect earnings.

General
economic conditions can affect the demand for the company’s equipment as well.
Current negative economic conditions and outlook have dampened demand for
certain equipment. Furthermore, governmental programs providing assistance to
certain industries or sectors could negatively impact the company’s competitive
position.

The
current economic downturn and market volatility have adversely affected the
financial industry in which John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital
Corporation) operates. Capital Corporation’s liquidity and ongoing
profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash
flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in
diversified funding activities and to fund purchases of the company’s products.
If current levels of market disruption

and volatility continue or worsen, funding could be unavailable or
insufficient. Additionally, under current market conditions customer confidence
levels may result in declines in credit applications and increases in
delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact Capital
Corporation’s write-offs and provisions for credit losses.

The
company’s outlook is based upon assumptions relating to the factors described
above, which are sometimes based upon estimates and data prepared by government
agencies. Such estimates and data are often revised. The company,

except as required by law, undertakes no
obligation to update or revise its outlook, whether as a result of new
developments or otherwise. Further information concerning the company and its
businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect the
company’s financial results, is included in other filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Worldwide
net income in 2007 was $1,822 million, or $4.00 per share diluted ($4.05
basic), compared with $1,694 million, or $3.59 per share diluted ($3.63 basic),
in 2006. Income from continuing operations, which excludes the company’s
discontinued health care business (see Note 2), was also $1,822 million, or
$4.00 per share diluted ($4.05 basic), in 2007, compared with $1,453 million,
or $3.08 per share diluted ($3.11 basic),

in 2006. Net sales and revenues from continuing operations increased 9
percent to $24,082 million in 2007, compared with $22,148 million in 2006. Net
sales of the Equipment Operations increased 8 percent in 2007 to $21,489
million from $19,884 million in 2006. This included a positive effect for
currency translation and price changes of 5 percent.

Net sales in the
U.S. and Canada were flat in 2007. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada
increased by 27 percent, which included a positive effect of 7 percent for
currency translation.

Worldwide
Equipment Operations had an operating profit of $2,318 million in 2007,
compared with $1,905 million in 2006. Higher operating profit was primarily due
to improved price realization and higher sales and production volumes.
Partially offsetting these factors were higher selling, administrative and
general expenses, increased raw material costs and higher research and
development costs.

The
Equipment Operations’ net income was $1,429 million in 2007, compared with
$1,089 million in 2006. The same operating factors mentioned above along with
the expense related to the repurchase of certain outstanding debt securities in
2006 and lower effective tax rates in 2007 affected these results.

Net
income of the company’s Financial Services

operations in 2007 decreased to $364 million,
compared with $584 million in 2006, primarily due to the sale of the health
care operations in 2006. Income from the Financial Services continuing
operations in 2007 was also $364 million, compared with $344 million in 2006.
The increase was primarily a result of growth in the credit portfolio,
partially offset by increased selling, administrative and general expenses and
a higher provision for credit losses. Additional information is presented in
the following discussion of the credit operations.


Income
from discontinued operations was $241 million in 2006, or $.51 per share
diluted ($.52 basic), primarily due to the sale of the health care operations
in 2006.

The
cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2007 was 75.6 percent, compared with 77.3
percent in 2006. The decrease was primarily due to improved price realization
and higher sales and production volumes, partially offset by higher raw
material costs.

Finance
and interest income, and interest expense increased in 2007 primarily due to
growth in the credit operations portfolio and higher financing rates. Other
income increased in 2007 primarily from increased service revenues. Research
and development costs increased in 2007 due to increased spending in support of
new products and the effect of currency translation. Selling, administrative
and general expenses increased primarily due to growth and the effect of
currency translation. Other operating expenses were higher primarily as a
result of increased cost of services, higher

depreciation expense on operating lease
equipment and the effect of currency translation, partially offset by the
expense related to the repurchase of outstanding notes in 2006 (see Note 3).

The
company has several defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health
care and life insurance plans. The company’s postretirement benefit costs for
these plans in 2007 were $415 million, compared with $447 million in 2006. The
long-term expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs,
was an expected gain of 8.3 percent in 2007 and 8.4 percent in 2006, or $838
million in 2007 and $795 million in 2006. The actual return was a gain of
$1,503 million in 2007, compared with a gain of $1,364 million in 2006. Total company
contributions to the plans were $646 million in 2007 and $866 million in 2006,
which include direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. These contributions
also included voluntary contributions to total plan assets of approximately
$520 million in 2007 and $760 million in 2006.

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS

Worldwide Agricultural Equipment Operations

The
agricultural equipment segment had an operating profit of $1,443 million in
2007, compared with $882 million in 2006. Net sales increased 18 percent in
2007 due to higher volumes, the favorable effects of currency translation and
improved price realization. The increase in operating profit was primarily due
to higher sales and production volumes, and improved price realization, partially
offset by higher selling, administrative and general expenses attributable in
large part to growth initiatives and currency translation. Also affecting the
profit were increased raw material costs and higher research and development
costs.

Worldwide Commercial and Consumer Equipment Operations

The
commercial and consumer equipment segment had an operating profit of $304
million in 2007, compared with $221 million in 2006. Net sales increased 12
percent in 2007, which included 9 percent from an acquisition of a landscapes
operation in May 2007. The improved operating profit was primarily due to
higher sales volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by higher
selling, administrative and general expenses largely attributed to the
acquisition.

Worldwide Construction and Forestry Operations

The
construction and forestry segment had an operating profit of $571 million in
2007, compared with $802 million in 2006. Net sales decreased 13 percent for
the year reflecting the downturn in U.S. housing starts. The operating profit
was lower primarily due to lower sales and production volumes and higher raw
material costs, partially offset by positive price

realization. The results in 2006 included
expenses related to the closure of a Canadian forestry equipment facility (see
Note 3).

Worldwide Credit Operations

The
operating profit of the credit operations was $548 million in 2007, compared
with $520 million in 2006. The increase in operating profit was primarily due
to growth in the credit portfolio, partially offset by increased selling,
administrative and general expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Total
revenues of the credit operations, including intercompany revenues, increased
13 percent in 2007, primarily reflecting the larger portfolio and higher
average finance rates. The average balance of receivables and leases financed
was 8 percent higher in 2007, compared with 2006. An increase in average
borrowings and higher interest rates in 2007 resulted in a 16 percent increase
in interest expense, compared with 2006. The credit operations’ ratio of
earnings to fixed charges was 1.55 to 1 in 2007, compared with 1.61 to 1 in
2006.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The
discussion of capital resources and liquidity has been organized to review
separately, where appropriate, the company’s consolidated totals, Equipment
Operations and Financial Services operations.

CONSOLIDATED

Positive
cash flows from consolidated operating activities in 2008 were $1,949 million.
This resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash provisions and an
increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which were partially offset
by an increase in inventories and trade receivables. Cash outflows from
investing activities were $1,426 million in 2008, primarily due to the
purchases of property and equipment of $1,112 million, the cost of receivables
and equipment on operating leases exceeding collections of receivables and the
proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $726 million, and acquisitions
of businesses for $252 million. These items were partially offset by the
proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities exceeding the cost
of marketable securities purchased by $597 million. Cash outflows from
financing activities were $649 million in 2008, primarily due to repurchases of
common stock of $1,678 million and dividends paid of $448 million, which were
partially offset by an increase in borrowings of $1,322 million, proceeds from
issuance of common stock of $109 million (resulting from the exercise

of stock options) and excess tax benefits
from share-based compensation of $73 million. Cash and cash equivalents also
decreased $67 million during 2008.


Over
the last three years, operating activities have provided an aggregate of $5,682
million in cash. In addition, increases in borrowings were $3,397 million,
proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities exceeded purchases
by $1,244 million, proceeds from issuance of common stock were $722 million and
the proceeds from sales of businesses were $559 million. The aggregate amount
of these cash flows was used mainly to fund repurchases of common stock of
$4,495 million, purchases of property and equipment of $2,901 million,
receivable and lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections and the proceeds
from sales of equipment on operating leases by $3,168 million, pay dividends to
stockholders of $1,183 million and acquire businesses for $497 million. Cash
and cash equivalents also decreased $47 million over the three-year period.

Given
the downturn in global economic activity and the recent significant changes in
credit market liquidity, sources of funds for the company have been impacted.
However, because of the funding sources that are available, the company expects
to have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its funding needs. Sources of
liquidity for the company include cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities, funds from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and term
debt, the securitization of retail notes (both public and private markets) and
committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit. At October 31, 2008, $2.1
billion of commercial paper of John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation)
was guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under its
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) (see Notes 18 and 29 of the
consolidated financial statements). If the Capital Corporation issues certain
maturities of commercial paper and senior unsecured debt following year end,
that debt would also be guaranteed under the same program. The company’s
commercial paper outstanding at October 31, 2008 and 2007 was
approximately $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, while the total cash
and cash equivalents and marketable securities position was $3.2 billion and
$3.9 billion, respectively.

Lines of Credit.

The company also has access to bank lines of
credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available
to both Deere & Company and Capital Corporation. Worldwide lines of
credit totaled $4,548 million at October 31, 2008, $1,534 million of which
were unused. For the purpose of computing unused credit lines, commercial paper
and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current
portion of long-term borrowings, were considered to constitute utilization.
Included in the total credit lines at October 31, 2008 was a long-term
credit facility agreement of $3.75 billion, expiring in February 2012. The
credit agreement requires the Capital Corporation to maintain its consolidated
ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal
quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to
capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder’s equity excluding
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the
end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreement also requires the Equipment
Operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and
stockholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss))
of 65 percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter according to accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. in effect at October 31, 2006.
Under this provision, the company’s excess equity capacity and retained
earnings balance free of restriction at October 31, 2008 was $6,730
million. Alternatively under this provision, the Equipment Operations had the
capacity to incur additional debt of $12,499 million at October 31, 2008. All
of these requirements of the credit agreement have been met during the periods
included in the consolidated financial statements.

Debt Ratings.

To access public debt capital markets, the
company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term
credit ratings to the company’s securities as an indicator of credit quality
for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the
rating agency to buy, sell or hold company securities. A credit rating agency
may change or withdraw company ratings based on its assessment of the company’s current and future ability
to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency’s rating
should be evaluated independently
of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing
costs and reduced access to debt capital markets. The senior long-term and
short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured company
securities by the rating agencies engaged by the company are as follows:

Trade
accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to
independent dealers. Trade receivables

increased by $180 million in 2008 primarily due to the increase in
sales and acquisitions of businesses. The ratio of trade accounts and notes
receivable at October 31 to fiscal year net sales was 13 percent in 2008, compared with 14 percent in 2007.
Total worldwide agricultural equipment receivables increased $205 million,
commercial and consumer equipment receivables
decreased $13 million and construction and forestry receivables decreased $12 million.
The collection period for trade receivables averages less than 12 months. The
percentage of trade receivables outstanding for a period exceeding 12 months
was 2 percent and 3 percent at October 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Stockholders’
equity was $6,533 million at October 31, 2008, compared with $7,156
million at October 31, 2007.

The
decrease of $623 million resulted primarily from an increase in treasury stock
of $1,579 million, dividends declared of $456 million, a decrease in the
cumulative translation adjustment of $406 million, a decrease in the retirement
benefits adjustment of $305 million and a charge of $48 million to retained
earnings from the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes (see Note 6). These items were partially offset by
net income of $2,053 million and an increase in common stock of $157 million.


The
cash flows from discontinued operations included in the consolidated cash flows
were not material except for the cash inflow from the sale of the health care
operations (net of cash sold) of approximately $440 million included in the
proceeds from sales of businesses in 2006.

EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS

The
company’s equipment businesses are capital intensive and are subject to
seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and certain
receivables from dealers. The Equipment Operations sell most of their trade
receivables to the company’s credit operations. As a result, there are
relatively small seasonal variations in the financing requirements of the
Equipment Operations. To the extent necessary, funds provided from operations
are supplemented by external financing sources.

Cash
provided by operating activities of the Equipment Operations during 2008,
including intercompany cash flows, was $2,365 million primarily due to net
income adjusted for non-cash provisions and an increase in accounts payable and
accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in inventories.

Over
the last three years, these operating activities, including intercompany cash
flows, have provided an aggregate of $6,365 million in cash.

Trade
receivables held by the Equipment Operations decreased by $15 million during
2008. The Equipment Operations sell a significant portion of their trade
receivables to the credit operations (see previous consolidated discussion).

Inventories
increased by $705 million in 2008 reflecting the increase in sales and
acquisitions of businesses. Most of these inventories are valued on the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The ratios of inventories on a first-in,
first-out (FIFO) basis (see Note 15), which approximates current cost, to
fiscal year cost of sales were 22 percent at both October 31, 2008 and
2007.

Total
interest-bearing debt of the Equipment Operations was $2,209 million at the end
of 2008, compared with $2,103 million at the end of 2007 and $2,252 million at
the end of 2006. The ratio of total debt to total capital (total
interest-bearing debt and stockholders’ equity) at the end of 2008, 2007 and
2006 was 25 percent, 23 percent and 23 percent, respectively.

Purchases
of property and equipment for the Equipment Operations in 2008 were $773
million, compared with $557 million in 2007. Capital expenditures in 2009 are
estimated to be approximately $1 billion.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

The
Financial Services’ credit operations rely on their ability to raise
substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios.
Their primary sources of funds for this purpose are a combination of commercial
paper, term debt, securitization of retail notes and equity capital.

Cash
flows from the company’s Financial Services operating activities, including
intercompany cash flows, were $940 million in 2008. Cash provided by financing
activities totaled $1,736 million in 2008, representing primarily a $1,264
million increase in external borrowings, an increase in borrowings from Deere &
Company of $569 million and $495 million capital investment from Deere &
Company, partially offset by the payment of $565 million of dividends paid to
Deere & Company. The cash provided by operating and financing
activities was used primarily to increase receivables and leases. Cash used by
investing activities totaled $1,832 million in 2008, primarily due to the cost
of receivables and equipment on operating leases exceeding collections of
receivables and

the
proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $1,517 million, and
purchases of property and equipment of $339 million. Cash and cash equivalents
also increased $918 million.

Over
the last three years, the Financial Services operating activities, including
intercompany cash flows, have provided $2,583 million in cash. In addition, an
increase in borrowings of $4,985 million, proceeds from sales of receivables of
$458 million and capital investment from Deere & Company of $644
million provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used mainly to fund
receivable and lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections and the proceeds
from sales of equipment on operating leases

by $5,342 million, pay dividends to Deere &
Company of $1,260 million and fund purchases of property and equipment of
$1,078 million. Cash and cash equivalents also increased $863 million over the
three-year period.

Receivables
and leases decreased by $136 million in 2008, compared with 2007. Acquisition
volumes of receivables and leases increased 16 percent in 2008, compared with
2007. The volumes of operating loans, wholesale notes, revolving charge accounts,
trade receivables, financing leases, operating leases and retail notes
increased approximately 58 percent,

23 percent, 21 percent, 16 percent, 14 percent, 9 percent and 6
percent, respectively. At October 31, 2008 and 2007, net receivables and
leases administered, which include receivables administered but not owned, were
$22,281 million and $22,543 million, respectively.

Total
external interest-bearing debt of the credit operations was $20,210 million at
the end of 2008, compared with $19,665 million at the end of 2007 and $17,453
million at the end of 2006. Included in this debt are secured borrowings of
$1,682 million at the end of 2008, $2,344 million at the end of 2007 and $2,403
million at the end of 2006. Total external borrowings have increased generally
corresponding with the level of the receivable and lease portfolio, the level
of cash

and cash
equivalents and the change in payables owed to Deere & Company. The
credit operations’ ratio of total interest-bearing debt to total stockholder’s
equity was 8.3 to 1 at the end of 2008, 8.2 to 1 at the end of 2007 and 7.1 to
1 at the end of 2006.

During
2008, the credit operations issued $6,320 million and retired $4,565 million of
long-term borrowings. The retirements included $850 million of 3.90% Notes due
2008 and the remainder consisted primarily of medium-term notes.

Purchases
of property and equipment for Financial Services in 2008 were $339 million,
compared with $465 million in 2007, primarily related to investments in wind
energy generation in both years. Capital expenditures for 2009 are estimated to
be approximately $125 million, also primarily related to investments in wind
energy generation.


OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The
company’s credit operations offer crop insurance products through a managing
general agency agreement (Agreement) with insurance companies (Insurance
Carriers) rated “Excellent” by A.M. Best Company. The credit operations
have guaranteed certain obligations under the Agreement, including the
obligation to pay the Insurance Carriers for any uncollected premiums. At October 31,
2008, the maximum exposure for uncollected premiums was approximately $60
million. Substantially all of the crop insurance risk under the Agreement has
been mitigated by a syndicate of private reinsurance companies. In the event

of a widespread catastrophic
crop failure throughout the U.S. and the default of all the reinsurance
companies on their obligations, the company would be required to reimburse the
Insurance Carriers approximately $824 million at October 31, 2008. The
company believes the likelihood of this event is substantially remote.

At
October 31, 2008, the company had approximately $180 million of guarantees
issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables
for the retail financing

of
John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any required
payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment
collateralizing the receivables. The maximum remaining term of the receivables
guaranteed at October 31, 2008 was approximately seven years.

AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The
payment schedule for the company’s contractual obligations at October 31,
2008 in millions of dollars is as follows:

*

Principal payments.

**

Notes
  payable of $1,682 million classified as short-term on the balance sheet
  related to the securitization of retail notes are included in this table
  based on the expected payment schedule (see Note 18).

The
table above does not include unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of
approximately $236 million at October 31, 2008 since the timing of future
payments is not reasonably estimable at this time (see Note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements). For additional information regarding
pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations, short-term
borrowings, long-term borrowings and lease obligations,

see Notes 5, 18, 20 and 21, respectively.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The
preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions
could have a significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting
policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the
preparation of the company’s financial statements and require the most
difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The company’s other accounting
policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sales Incentives

At
the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company records an estimate of
the future sales incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that
will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The
estimate is based on historical data, announced incentive programs, field
inventory levels and settlement volumes. The final cost of these programs and
the amount of accrual required for a specific sale are fully determined when
the dealer sells the equipment to the retail customer. This is due to numerous
programs available at any particular time and new programs that may be
announced after the company records the sale. Changes in the mix and types of
programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.

The
sales incentive accruals at October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $737
million, $711 million and $629 million, respectively. The increases in 2008 and
2007 were primarily due to the increases in sales.

The
estimation of the sales incentive accrual is impacted by many assumptions. One
of the key assumptions is the historical percent of sales incentive costs to
settlements from dealers. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has
varied by approximately plus or minus .8 percent, compared to the average sales
incentive costs to settlements percent during that period. Holding other assumptions
constant, if this cost experience percent were to increase or decrease 1.0
percent,

the sales
incentive accrual at October 31, 2008 would increase or decrease by
approximately $50 million.

Product Warranties

At
the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company records the estimated
future warranty costs. The company generally determines its total warranty
liability by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount
of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer
inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily
determined by a review of five-year claims costs and consideration of current
quality developments. Variances in claims experience and the type of warranty
programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.

The
product warranty accruals, excluding extended warranty unamortized premiums, at
October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $586 million, $549 million and $507
million, respectively. The increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to
increases in sales volume.


Estimates
used to determine the product warranty accruals are significantly affected by
the historical percent of warranty claims costs to sales. Over the last five
fiscal years, this loss experience percent has varied by approximately plus or
minus .03 percent, compared to the average warranty costs to sales percent
during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost
experience percent were to increase or decrease .05 percent, the warranty
accrual at October 31, 2008 would increase or decrease by approximately
$15 million.

Postretirement Benefit Obligations

Pension
obligations and other postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) obligations are
based on various assumptions used by the company’s actuaries in calculating
these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend
rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement rates,
mortality rates and other factors. Actual results that differ from the
assumptions and changes in assumptions affect future expenses and obligations.

The
pension assets, net of pension liabilities, recognized on the balance sheet at October 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 were $683 million, $1,467 million and $1,945 million,
respectively. The OPEB liabilities on these same dates were $2,535 million,
$3,065 million and $1,985 million, respectively. The decrease in the pension
net assets in 2008 was primarily due to the decrease in market value of assets,
partially offset by the increase in the discount rates for the liabilities. The
decrease

in the OPEB
liabilities in 2008 was primarily due to the increase in discount rates. The
decrease in the pension net assets and the increase in the OPEB liabilities in
2007 were primarily due to the adoption in 2007 of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (see Note 5). This standard
required unrecognized gains or losses relating to postretirement benefit obligations to be recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding charge or credit to
stockholders’ equity.

The
effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on the company’s major
U. S. retirement benefit plans would be as follows in millions of dollars:

*

Projected
  benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement
  benefit obligation (APBO) for OPEB plans.

**

Pretax
  impact on service cost, interest cost and amortization of gains or losses.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The
allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of

the losses expected from the company’s
receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many quantitative
and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience by product
category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and
credit risk quality. The adequacy of
the allowance is assessed quarterly. Different assumptions or changes in
economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses
and the provision for credit losses.

The
total allowance for credit losses at October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
$226 million, $236 million and $217 million, respectively. The decrease in 2008
was primarily due to foreign currency translation. The increase in 2007 was
primarily due to growth in the receivable portfolio.

The
assumptions used in evaluating the company’s exposure to credit losses involve
estimates and significant judgment. The historical loss experience on the
receivable portfolio represents one of the key assumptions involved in
determining the allowance for credit losses. Over the last five fiscal years,
the average loss experience has fluctuated between 2 basis points and 18 basis
points in any given fiscal year over the applicable prior period. Holding other
estimates constant,

a 10
basis point increase or decrease in estimated loss experience on the receivable
portfolio would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $20 million
to the allowance for credit losses at October 31, 2008.

Operating Lease Residual Values

The
carrying value of equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated
fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon
termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or
sold to a third party, in which case the company may record a gain or a loss
for the difference between the estimated residual value and

the sales price. The residual values are
dependent on current economic conditions and are reviewed quarterly. Changes in
residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and
the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases.

The
total operating lease residual values at October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
were $1,055 million, $1,072 million and $917 million, respectively. The changes
in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to the levels of operating leases.

Estimates
used in determining end of lease market values for equipment on operating
leases significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. If
future market values for this equipment were to decrease 5 percent from

the company’s present estimates, the total
impact would be to increase the company’s annual depreciation for equipment on
operating leases by approximately $20 million.


FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK INFORMATION

The
company is naturally exposed to various interest rate and foreign currency
risks. As a result, the company enters into derivative transactions to manage
certain of these exposures that arise in the normal course of business and not
for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The company’s
credit operations manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their
funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in

an effort to diminish risk due to interest
rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing
opportunities. Accordingly, from time to time, these operations enter into
interest rate swap agreements to manage their interest rate exposure. The
company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic
operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than
the local currencies. The company has entered into agreements related to the
management of these currency transaction risks. The credit risk under these
interest rate and foreign currency agreements is not considered to be
significant.

Interest Rate Risk

Quarterly,
the company uses a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of
its financial instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market
interest rates. The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as
follows. Cash flows for financing receivables are discounted at the current
prevailing rate for each receivable portfolio. Cash flows for marketable
securities are primarily discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve.
Cash flows for unsecured borrowings are discounted at the applicable benchmark
yield curve plus market credit spreads for similarly rated borrowers. Cash
flows for securitized borrowings are discounted at the swap yield curve plus a
market credit spread for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for interest
rate swaps are projected and discounted using forecasted rates from the swap
yield curve at the repricing dates. The net loss in these financial instruments’
fair values which would be caused by decreasing the interest rates by 10
percent from the market rates at October 31, 2008 would have been
approximately $87 million. The net loss from increasing the interest rates by
10 percent at October 31, 2007 would have been approximately $22 million.

Foreign Currency Risk

In
the Equipment Operations, it is the company’s practice to hedge significant
currency exposures. Worldwide foreign currency exposures are reviewed
quarterly. Based on the Equipment Operations’ anticipated and committed foreign
currency cash inflows and outflows for the next twelve months and the foreign
currency derivatives at year end, the company estimates that a hypothetical 10
percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies through 2009
would decrease the 2009 expected net cash inflows by $31 million. At last year
end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar under similar
assumptions and calculations indicated a potential $77 million adverse effect
on the 2008 net cash inflows.

In
the Financial Services operations, the company’s policy is to hedge the foreign
currency risk if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of
the receivable portfolio. As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change
in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would
not have a material effect on the Financial Services cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The
following are significant accounting policies in addition to those included in
other notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of all companies
in which Deere & Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable
interest entities (VIEs) primarily related to the securitization of financing
receivables for secured borrowings are consolidated since the company is the
primary beneficiary. Deere & Company records its investment in each
unconsolidated affiliated company (generally 20 to 50 percent ownership) at its
related equity in the net assets of such affiliate. Other investments (less
than 20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost. Consolidated retained earnings
at October 31, 2008 include undistributed earnings of the unconsolidated
affiliates

of $99
million. Dividends from unconsolidated affiliates were $20 million in 2008, $13
million in 2007 and $3 million in 2006 (see Note 8).

Reclassification

Certain
items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been
reclassified to conform to the 2008 financial statement presentation. In
particular, “Accrued taxes” previously presented separately has been combined
with “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” on the consolidated balance sheet.

Structure of Operations

Certain
information in the notes and related commentary are presented in a format which
includes data grouped as follows:

Equipment Operations

— Includes the company’s agricultural
equipment, commercial and consumer equipment and construction and forestry
operations with Financial Services reflected on the equity basis except for the
health care operations, which were disposed of in February 2006 and are
reported on a discontinued basis (see Note 2).

Financial Services

— Includes the company’s credit and certain
miscellaneous service operations with the health care operations reported on a
discontinued basis.

Consolidated

— Represents the consolidation of the
Equipment Operations and Financial Services with the health care operations
reported on a discontinued basis. References to “Deere & Company” or “the
company” refer to the entire enterprise.

Stock Split in Form of Dividend

On
November 14, 2007, a special meeting of stockholders was held authorizing
a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend
to holders of record

on November 26,
2007, distributed on December 3, 2007. All share and per share data
(except par value) have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split
for all periods presented. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon
exercise of outstanding stock options, vesting of other stock awards, and the
number of shares reserved for issuance under various employee benefit plans
were proportionately increased in accordance with terms of the respective plans.

Use of Estimates in Financial Statements

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Sales
of equipment and service parts are recorded when the sales price is
determinable and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to
independent parties based on the sales agreements in effect. In the U.S. and
most international locations, this

transfer occurs primarily when goods are shipped. In Canada and some
other international locations, certain goods are shipped to dealers on a
consignment basis under which the risks and rewards of ownership are not
transferred to the dealer. Accordingly, in these locations, sales are not recorded until a retail customer has
purchased the goods. In all cases, when a sale is recorded by the company, no
significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchaser’s obligation to pay.
No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Service parts returns are
estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized. The company makes
appropriate provisions based on experience for costs such as doubtful
receivables, sales incentives and product warranty.

Financing
revenue is recorded over the lives of related receivables using the interest
method. Deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are
recognized as a reduction in finance revenue over the expected lives of the
receivables using the interest method. Income from operating leases is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms.

Sales Incentives

At
the time a sale is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future
sales incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that will be due
when a dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based
on

historical data,
announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and settlement volumes.

Product Warranties

At
the time a sale is recognized, the company records the estimated future
warranty costs. These costs are usually estimated based on historical warranty
claims (see Note 22).

Sales Taxes

The
company collects and remits taxes assessed by different governmental
authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing
transactions between the company and its customers. These taxes may include
sales, use, value-added and some excise taxes. The company reports the
collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues).

Securitization of Receivables

Certain
financing receivables are periodically transferred to Special Purpose Entities
(SPEs) in securitization transactions (see Note 12). These securitizations
qualify as collateral for secured borrowings and no gains or losses are
recognized at the time of securitization. The receivables remain on the balance

sheet and are classified as “Restricted
financing receivables - net.” The company recognizes finance income over the
lives of these receivables using the interest method.


Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping
and handling costs related to the sales of the company’s equipment are included
in cost of sales.

Advertising Costs

Advertising
costs are charged to expense as incurred. This expense was $188 million in
2008, $169 million in 2007 and $165 million in 2006.

Depreciation and Amortization

Property
and equipment, capitalized software and other intangible assets are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method.
Equipment on operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using
the straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and
revised products, increased capacity and the

replacement or major renewal of significant
items are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals
are generally charged to expense as incurred.

Receivables and Allowances

All
financing and trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet at
outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs,

the allowance for credit losses and doubtful
accounts, and any deferred fees or costs on originated financing receivables.
Allowances for credit losses and doubtful accounts are maintained in amounts
considered to be appropriate in relation to the receivables outstanding based
on collection experience, economic conditions and credit risk quality.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

The
company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets (including property
and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) when events and
circumstances warrant such a review. Goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite lives are also tested for impairment annually at the end of the
third fiscal quarter each year. Goodwill is allocated and reviewed for
impairment by reporting units, which consist primarily of the operating
segments. The goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business
that created the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill impairment, the
carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the
carrying

value of the
goodwill or long-lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based
on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.

Derivative Financial Instruments

It
is the company’s policy that derivative transactions are executed only to
manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for the
purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The company’s credit
operations manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding
sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk
due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to
favorable financing opportunities. The company also has foreign currency
exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying,
selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies.

All
derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Each derivative is
designated as either a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or remains
undesignated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
effective as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and
reclassified to the income statement when the effects of the item being hedged
are recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are designated and effective as fair value hedges are
recognized currently in net income. These changes are offset in net income to
the extent the hedge was effective by fair value changes related to the risk being
hedged on the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges are
recognized currently in the income statement. All ineffective changes in
derivative fair values are recognized currently in net income.

All
designated hedges are formally documented as to the relationship with the
hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on
an ongoing basis the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness,
when applicable. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly
effective as a hedge, or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely
to occur, or the derivative is terminated, the hedge accounting discussed above
is discontinued (see Note 27).

Foreign Currency Translation

The
functional currencies for most of the company’s foreign operations are their
respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are
translated into U.S. dollars at the end of the period exchange rates. The
revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates for the period.
The gains or losses from these translations are recorded in other comprehensive
income. Gains or losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than
the functional currency of the subsidiary involved and foreign exchange forward
contracts and options are included in net income or other comprehensive income
as appropriate. The total foreign exchange pretax net gain (loss) for 2008,
2007 and 2006 was $(13) million, $(28) million and $2 million, respectively.

New Accounting Standards Adopted

In
the first quarter of 2008, the company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This Interpretation clarifies that
the recognition for uncertain tax positions should be based on a more-likely-than-not
threshold that the tax position will be sustained upon audit. The tax position
is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent
probability of being realized upon settlement. The standard was adopted at the beginning
of fiscal year 2008 with the cumulative effect reported as an adjustment to
beginning retained earnings as required. The cumulative effect of adoption
increased assets by $158 million, increased liabilities by $206 million and
decreased retained earnings by $48 million (see Note 6).

At
October 31, 2007, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 158,
Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans (see Note 5). This Statement requires retirement benefit accruals or prepaid
benefit costs on the balance sheet to be adjusted to the difference between the
benefit obligations and the plan assets at fair value. The offset to the
adjustment is recorded directly in stockholders’ equity net of tax. The amount
recorded in stockholders’ equity represents the after-tax unrecognized
actuarial gains or losses and


unamortized prior service costs, which have previously been disclosed
in the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements. Prospective
application is required. At October 31, 2007, the effect of adopting this
Statement decreased assets by $9 million, increased liabilities by $1,082
million and decreased stockholders’ equity by $1,091 million after-tax. The
company did not violate any credit agreement financial covenants as a result of
adopting this new standard.

New Accounting Standards to be Adopted

In
September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements. This Statement defines fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. These methods will apply to other accounting standards
that

use fair value
measurements and may change the application of certain measurements used in
current practice. The effective date is the beginning of fiscal year 2009 for
financial assets and liabilities. For nonfinancial assets and liabilities, the
effective date is the beginning of fiscal year 2010, except items that are
recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption
will not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
statements.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This Statement permits
entities to measure most financial instruments at fair value if desired. It may
be applied on a contract by contract basis and is irrevocable once applied to
those contracts. The standard may be applied at the time of adoption for
existing eligible items, or at initial recognition of eligible items. After
election of this option, changes in fair

value are reported in earnings. The items measured at fair value must
be shown separately on the balance sheet. The effective date is the beginning
of fiscal year 2009. The cumulative effect of adoption would be reported as an
adjustment to beginning retained earnings. The adoption will not have a
material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007),
Business Combinations, and Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements. Statement No. 141 (revised 2007)
requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their
fair values on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over
the net identifiable assets acquired. This standard also requires the fair
value measurement of certain other assets and liabilities related to the acquisition
such as contingencies and research and development. Statement No. 160
clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as
equity in the consolidated financial statements. Consolidated net income should
include the net income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest with
disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of income. The
calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts
attributable to the parent. The effective date for both Statements is the
beginning of fiscal year 2010. The company has currently not determined the
potential effects on the consolidated financial statements.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This Statement increases the
disclosure requirements for derivative instruments. The new requirements
include the location and fair value amounts of all derivatives by category
reported in the consolidated balance sheet; the location and amount of gains or
losses of all derivatives and designated hedged items by category reported in
the consolidated income statement, or in other comprehensive income in the
consolidated balance sheet; and measures of volume such as notional amounts.
For derivatives designated as hedges, the gains or losses must be divided into
the effective portions and the ineffective portions. The Statement also
requires the disclosure of group concentrations of credit risk by
counterparties, including the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk and
policies concerning collateral and master netting arrangements. Most
disclosures

are required
on an interim and annual basis. The effective date is the second quarter of
fiscal year 2009. The adoption will not have a material effect on the company’s
consolidated financial statements

In
May 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 162, The Hierarchy of
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This Statement identifies the sources
for generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S. and lists the
categories in descending order. An entity should follow the

highest category of GAAP applicable for each
of its accounting transactions. The adoption will not have a material effect on
the company’s consolidated financial statements.

Variable Interest Entities

The
company’s credit operations are the primary beneficiary of certain variable
interest entities (VIEs) that are special purpose entities (SPEs) related to
the securitization of financing receivables. Under FASB Interpretation No. 46
(revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
these SPEs were consolidated. The SPEs included assets (restricted retail
notes) of $1,259 million and $1,494 million at October 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. These restricted retail notes are included in the restricted
financing receivables related to securitizations shown in the table in Note 12.

The
company is also the primary beneficiary of a supplier that is a VIE. The VIE
produces blended fertilizer and other lawn care products for the commercial and
consumer equipment segment. The assets of the VIE that were consolidated, less
the intercompany receivables eliminated in consolidation, totaled $74 million.
The creditors of the VIE do not have recourse to the general credit of the
company.

Acquisitions

In
May 2008, the company acquired T-Systems International, Inc.
(T-Systems) for a cost of approximately $85 million. T-Systems, which is
headquartered in California, manufactures and markets drip tape and agronomic
technologies for irrigation. The acquisition is included in the agricultural
equipment segment. The preliminary values assigned to major assets and
liabilities related to the acquisition were $29 million of receivables, $20
million of inventories, $43 million of property equipment,


$12
million of identifiable intangibles primarily for technology and trademarks, $8
million of goodwill, $17 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses and
$10 million of deferred income tax liabilities. The weighted-average
amortization period of the identifiable intangibles was six years. The goodwill
is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

In
June 2008, the company acquired Plastro Irrigation Systems Ltd. (Plastro)
for a cost of approximately $120 million. Plastro, which is headquartered in
Israel, manufactures and markets drip and micro drip irrigation products for
nursery and agricultural applications. The acquisition is included in

the agricultural equipment segment. The
preliminary values assigned to major assets and liabilities related to the
acquisition were $12 million of cash, $63 million of receivables, $48 million
of inventories, $44 million of property and equipment, $4 million of other
assets, $40 million of identifiable intangible assets primarily for customer
lists and trademarks, $46 million of goodwill, $61 million of accounts payable
and accrued expenses, $51 million of short-term borrowings, $13 million of
long-term borrowings and $12 million of deferred income tax liabilities. The
weighted-average amortization period of the identifiable intangibles was eight
years. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

In
June 2008, the company acquired a 50 percent equity investment in Xuzhou
Xuwa Excavator Machinery Co., Ltd. (XCG) and has invested approximately $55
million in the joint venture in 2008. XCG is a domestic excavator manufacturer
in China and is included in the construction and forestry segment.

The
goodwill generated in these acquisitions was the result of the future cash
flows and related fair values of the entity acquired exceeding the fair values
of its identifiable assets

and
liabilities. Certain long-lived assets including other intangibles are still
being evaluated. The results of these operations have been included in the
company’s financial statements since the date of the acquisition. The pro forma
results of operations as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of
the fiscal year would not differ significantly from the reported results.

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In
February 2006, the company sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, John Deere
Health Care, Inc. (health care operations), to UnitedHealthcare for $512
million and recognized a gain on the sale of $356 million pretax, or $223
million after-tax ($.47 per share diluted, $.48 per share basic). These
operations and the gain on the sale have been reflected as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

The
revenue from discontinued operations on the statement of consolidated income in
2006 was $621 million, and the income before income taxes was $384 million. The
fees paid from the continuing operations to the discontinued health care
operations for administering health care claims in 2006 were $7 million. The
company will continue to pay fees to UnitedHealthcare to administer health
claims. The employee termination benefit expense accrued in the discontinued
operations in 2006 was $8 million, with payments of $4 million in 2006, $1
million in 2007 and $3 million in 2008.

3. SPECIAL ITEMS

Restructuring

Welland

In
September 2008, the company announced it will close its manufacturing
facility in Welland, Ontario, Canada, and

transfer production to company operations in Wisconsin and Mexico. The
Welland factory manufactures utility vehicles and attachments for the agricultural equipment and commercial and
consumer equipment businesses. The move supports ongoing efforts aimed at
improved efficiency and profitability. The plant is scheduled to close by the
end of 2009.

The
closure is expected to result in total expenses recognized in cost of sales of
approximately $98 million pretax, of which $49 million was recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2008. These total expenses will consist of approximately $41
million of pension and other postretirement benefits, $21 million of property
and equipment impairments, $26 million of employee termination benefits and $10
million of other expenses. The expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $10
million of pension and other postretirement benefits, $21 million of property
and equipment impairments and $18 million of employee termination benefits. The
liability for employee termination benefits at October 31, 2008 was $18
million.

The
total expenses will be approximately $59 million for the agricultural equipment
segment and $39 million for the commercial and consumer equipment segment. In
the fourth quarter of 2008, the total expenses were $29 million for the agricultural
equipment segment and $20 million for the commercial and consumer equipment
segment. The total pretax cash expenditures associated with this closure will
be approximately $40 million. The annual increase in earnings and cash flows in
the future due to this restructuring is estimated to be approximately $40
million.

Woodstock

In
January 2006, the company decided to close its forestry manufacturing
facility in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada and consolidate the manufacturing into
the company’s existing Davenport and Dubuque, Iowa facilities. This
restructuring was intended to reduce costs and further improve product delivery
times. The facility was included in the construction and forestry segment.

The
total pretax expense recognized in costs of sales in 2006 related to the
closure was $44 million pretax, which included $21 million for pension and
other postretirement benefits; $10 million for employee termination benefits; $6
million for impairments and write-downs of property, equipment and inventory;
$5 million for relocation of production and $2 million for other expenses. At October 31,
2006, there were no remaining significant liabilities or expenses related

to the restructuring. The pretax
cash expenditures associated with this closure were approximately $35 million.
The annual increase in earnings and cash flows due to this restructuring were
approximately $10 million.


Debt Repurchase

In
February 2006, the company announced a cash tender offer of up to $500
million to repurchase outstanding notes. An aggregate principal amount of $433
million was repurchased in 2006 consisting of $144 million of 8.95% Debentures
due 2019, $194 million of 7.85% Debentures due 2010 and $95 million of 8-1/2%
Debentures due 2022. The repurchase of these notes for approximately $500
million resulted in an expense of $70 million pretax in 2006, which was
included

in other
operating expenses.

4. CASH FLOW INFORMATION

For
purposes of the statement of consolidated cash flows,

the company considers investments with
purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Substantially all of the company’s short-term borrowings, excluding the current
maturities of long-term borrowings, mature or may require payment within three
months or less.

The
Equipment Operations sell most of their trade receivables to Financial
Services. These intercompany cash flows are eliminated in the consolidated cash
flows.

All
cash flows from the changes in trade accounts and notes receivable (see Note
10) are classified as operating activities in the Statement of Consolidated
Cash Flows as these receivables arise from sales to the company’s customers.
Cash flows from financing receivables that are related to sales to the company’s
customers (see Note 11) are also included in operating activities. The
remaining financing receivables are related to the financing of equipment sold
by independent dealers and are included in investing activities.

The
company had the following non-cash operating and investing activities that were
not included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. The company
transferred inventory to equipment on operating leases of approximately $307
million, $269 million and $290 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The company had accounts payable related to purchases of property and equipment
of approximately $158 million, $100 million and $80 million at October 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At October 31, 2007, the company
recorded a receivable of $47 million for a portion of the sale of a business
and a liability of $41 million for a portion of the acquisition of a business,
which were settled in 2008.

Cash
payments for interest and income taxes consisted of the following in millions
of dollars:

5.

PENSION AND OTHER
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The
company has several defined benefit pension plans covering its U.S. employees
and employees in certain foreign countries. The company has several
postretirement health care and life insurance plans for retired employees in
the U.S. and Canada. The company uses an October 31 measurement date for
these plans.

On
October 31, 2007, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 158,
Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans. This Statement requires retirement benefit liabilities or benefit assets
on the balance sheet to be adjusted to the difference between the benefit
obligations and the plan assets at fair value. The offset to the adjustment is
recorded directly in stockholders’ equity net of tax. The amount recorded in
stockholders’ equity represents the after-tax unamortized actuarial gains or
losses and unamortized prior service cost (credit). This Statement also
requires all benefit obligations and plan assets to be measured at fiscal year
end, which the company presently does. Prospective application of the new
accounting is required.

The
incremental effects of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 158 on October 31,
2007 in millions of dollars follow:

The
components of net periodic pension cost and the assumptions related to the cost
consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents:


The
components of net periodic postretirement benefits cost and the assumptions
related to the cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in
percents:

The
above benefit plan costs in net income and other changes in plan assets and
benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in 2008 in millions of
dollars were as follows:

The
benefit plan obligations, funded status and the assumptions related to the
obligations at October 31 in millions of dollars follow:

The
amounts recognized at October 31 in millions of dollars consist of the
following:

The
total accumulated benefit obligations for all pension plans at October 31,
2008 and 2007 was $6,856 million and $8,131 million, respectively.

The
accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans
with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $767 million
and $423 million, respectively, at October 31, 2008 and $741 million and

$312 million, respectively, at October 31,
2007. The projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for
pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $873 million and $450 million,
respectively, at October 31, 2008 and $877 million and $368 million,
respectively, at October 31, 2007.


The
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to be
amortized as net expense (income) during fiscal 2009 in millions of dollars
follow:

The
company expects to contribute approximately $69 million to its pension plans and
approximately $99 million to its health care and life insurance plans in 2009,
which include direct benefit payments on unfunded plans.

The
benefits expected to be paid from the benefit plans, which reflect expected
future years of service, and the Medicare subsidy expected to be received are
as follows in millions of dollars:

*
Medicare Part D subsidy.

The
annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
(the health care cost trend rates) used to determine benefit obligations at October 31,
2008 were based on the trends for medical and prescription drug claims

for pre- and post-65 age groups due to the
effects of Medicare. The weighted-average composite trend rates were assumed to be 7.1 percent for 2009, 6.3 percent
for 2010, 5.8 percent for 2011, 5.2 percent for 2012 and 5.0 percent for 2013
and all future years. The obligations at October 31, 2007 assumed 8.0 percent for 2008, 7.1 percent for 2009,
6.3 percent for 2010, 5.8 percent for 2011, 5.2 percent for 2012 and 5.0
percent for 2013 and all future years. An increase of one percentage point in
the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations at October 31, 2008 by $412 million and
the aggregate of service and interest cost component of net periodic
postretirement benefits cost for
the year by $45 million. A decrease of one percentage point would decrease the
obligations by $352 million and the cost by $38 million.

The
discount rate assumptions used to determine the postretirement obligations at October 31,
2008 and 2007 were based on hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a
series of annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying the
yield curves are required to have a rating of Aa or better by Moody’s Investor
Service, Inc. or a rating AA or better by Standard & Poor’s.

The
following is the percentage allocation for plan assets at October 31:

*

The pension and health care debt securities
include 24 percent and 7 percent in 2008 and 20 percent and 7 percent in 2007,
respectively, of non-fixed income securities that have been combined with
derivatives to create fixed income exposures.

The
primary investment objective is to maximize the growth of the pension and
health care plan assets to meet the projected obligations to the beneficiaries
over a long period of time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with
the

company’s earnings
strength and risk tolerance. Asset allocation policy is the most important
decision in managing the assets and it is reviewed regularly. The asset
allocation policy considers the
company’s financial strength and long-term asset class risk/ return
expectations since the obligations are long-term in nature. On an on-going
basis, the target allocations for pension assets are approximately 32 percent
for equity securities, 44 percent for debt securities (see note in table
above), 5 percent for real estate and 19 percent for other. The target
allocations for health care assets are approximately 49 percent for equity
securities, 37 percent for debt
securities (see note in table above), 3 percent for real estate and 11 percent
for other. The assets are well diversified and are managed by professional
investment firms as well as by investment professionals who are company
employees.

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management’s
expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide
for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. The expected return
is based on the outlook for inflation and for returns in multiple asset
classes, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation and
investment strategy. The company’s approach has emphasized the long-term nature
of the return estimate such that the return assumption is not changed unless
there are fundamental changes in capital markets that affect the company’s
expectations for returns over an extended period of time (i.e., ten to 20
years). The average annual return of the company’s U.S. pension fund was
approximately 7.1 percent during the past ten years and approximately 10.0
percent during the past 20 years. Since return premiums over inflation and
total returns for major asset classes vary widely even over ten-year periods,
recent history is not necessarily indicative of long-term future expected
returns.

The company’s
systematic methodology for determining the long-term rate of return for the
company’s investment strategies supports the long-term expected return
assumptions.

The
company has created certain Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association trusts
(VEBAs) for the funding of postretirement health care benefits. The future
expected asset returns for these VEBAs are lower than the expected return on
the other pension and health care plan assets due to investment in a higher
proportion of short-term liquid securities.


These
assets are in addition to the other postretirement health care plan assets that
have been funded under Section 401(h) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code and maintained in a separate account in the company’s pension plan trust.

See
Note 25 for defined contribution plans related to employee investment and
savings.

6. INCOME TAXES

The
provision for income taxes from continuing operations by taxing jurisdiction
and by significant component consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

Based
upon location of the company’s operations, the consolidated income from
continuing operations before income taxes in the U.S. in 2008, 2007 and 2006
was $1,730 million, $1,601 million and $1,431 million, respectively, and in
foreign countries was $1,394 million, $1,075 million and $743 million,
respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches of

Deere & Company and are, therefore,
subject to U.S., as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income
by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision by taxing
jurisdiction are, therefore, not directly related.

A
comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision from continuing
operations and reasons for related differences in millions of dollars follow:

At
October 31, 2008, accumulated earnings in certain subsidiaries outside the
U.S. totaled $1,220 million for which no provision for U.S. income taxes or
foreign withholding taxes has been made, because it is expected that such
earnings will be reinvested overseas indefinitely. Determination of the amount
of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not
practical.

Deferred
income taxes arise because there are certain items that are treated differently
for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of
the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at October 31 in millions
of dollars follows:

Deere &
Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which
includes the wholly-owned Financial Services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries
account for income taxes generally as if they filed separate income tax
returns.

At
October 31, 2008, certain tax loss and tax credit carryforwards for $124
million were available with $1 million expiring in 2009, $92 million expiring
from 2010 through 2028 and $31 million with an unlimited expiration date.

The
company adopted FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, at the beginning of 2008. As a result of adoption,
the company recorded an increase in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits
of $170 million, an increase in accrued interest and penalties payable of $30
million, an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $6 million, a reduction in the beginning retained
earnings balance of $48 million, an increase in tax receivables of $136
million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $11 million and an increase in
interest receivable of $11 million.

A
reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at October 31
in millions of dollars is as follows:


The
amount of unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2008 that would affect
the effective tax rate if the tax benefits were recognized was $61 million. The
remaining liability

was
related to tax positions for which there are offsetting tax receivables, or the
uncertainty was only related to timing. The company does not believe it is reasonably possible that the amounts
of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease over the
next twelve months.

The
company files its tax returns according to the tax laws of the jurisdictions in
which it operates, which includes the U.S. federal jurisdictions, and various
state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has
completed its examination of the company’s federal income tax returns for
periods prior to 2001, and for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004. The year 2001 and
2005 through 2007 federal income tax returns are either currently under
examination or remain subject to examination. Various state and foreign income
tax returns, including major tax jurisdictions in Canada and Germany,

also remain subject to examination by taxing
authorities.

The company’s continuing policy is to recognize
interest related to income taxes in interest expense and interest income, and
recognize penalties in selling, administrative and general expenses. During
2008, the total amount of expense from interest and penalties was $23 million
and the interest income was $2 million. At October 31, 2008, the liability
for accrued interest and penalties totaled $45 million and the receivable for
interest was $5 million.

7.

OTHER INCOME AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

The
major components of other income and other operating expenses from continuing
operations consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

8.

UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES

Unconsolidated
affiliated companies are companies in which Deere & Company generally
owns 20 percent to 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares. Deere &
Company does not control these companies and accounts for its investments in
them on the equity basis. The investments in these companies primarily consist
of Deere-Hitachi Construction Machinery Corporation (50 percent ownership),
Xuzhou Xuwa Excavator Machinery Co., Ltd. (50 percent ownership), Bell
Equipment Limited (32 percent ownership) and A&I Products (36 percent
ownership). The unconsolidated affiliated companies primarily manufacture or
market equipment. Deere & Company’s share of the income of these
companies is reported in the consolidated income statement under “Equity in
Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates.” The investment in these companies is
reported in

the
consolidated balance sheet under “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates.”

Combined
financial information of the unconsolidated affiliated companies in millions of
dollars is as follows:

9.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

All
marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale, with unrealized
gains and losses shown as a component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains
or losses from the sales of marketable securities are based on the specific
identification method.

The
amortized cost and fair value of marketable

securities at October 31 in millions of
dollars follow:


The
contractual maturities of debt securities at October 31, 2008 in millions
of dollars follow:

Actual
maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some securities may
be called or prepaid. Proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities
were $1,137 million in 2008, $1,379 million in 2007 and $2,157 in 2006.
Realized gains were $12 million, $4 million and $.4 million and realized losses
were $15 million, $10 million and $4 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Unrealized gains and losses, the increase (decrease) in net
unrealized gains or losses and unrealized losses that have been continuous for
over twelve months were not significant in any years presented. Unrealized
losses at October 31, 2008 were primarily the result of an increase in
interest rates and were not recognized in income due to the ability and intent
to hold to maturity. Losses related to impairment write-downs were $27 million
in 2008, $7 million in 2007 and were not significant for 2006.

10.

TRADE ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Trade
accounts and notes receivable at October 31 consisted of the following in
millions of dollars:

At
October 31, 2008 and 2007, dealer notes included in the previous table
were $499 million and $413 million, and the allowance for doubtful trade
receivables was $56 million and $64 million, respectively.

The
Equipment Operations sell a significant portion of newly originated trade
receivables to the credit operations and provide compensation to the credit
operations at market rates of interest for these receivables.

Trade
accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to
independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is
charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when
goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain
interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until
payment is received by the company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after the
equipment is shipped and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is
not sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on
the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range
from one to twelve months for most equipment.

Interest-free periods may not be extended.
Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed
market rates. The company evaluates and assesses dealers on an ongoing basis as
to their credit worthiness and generally retains a security interest in the
goods associated with the trade receivables. The company is obligated to
repurchase goods sold to a dealer upon cancellation or termination of the
dealer’s contract for such causes as change in ownership and closeout of the
business.

Trade
accounts and notes receivable have significant concentrations of credit risk in
the agricultural, commercial and consumer, and construction and forestry
sectors as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there is not a
disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area.

11.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES

Financing
receivables at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of
dollars:

The
residual values for investments in financing

leases at October 31, 2008 and 2007
totaled $63 million and $71 million, respectively.

Financing
receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agricultural,
commercial and consumer,

and
construction and forestry sectors as shown in the previous table. On a
geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk
in any area. The company retains as
collateral a security interest in the equipment associated with retail notes,
wholesale notes and financing leases.


Financing
receivables at October 31 related to the company’s sales of equipment (see
Note 4) that were included in the table above were unrestricted and consisted
of the following in millions of dollars:

*    These
retail notes generally arise from sales of equipment by company-owned dealers
or through direct sales.

Financing
receivable installments, including unearned finance income, at October 31
are scheduled as follows in millions of dollars:

The
maximum terms for retail notes are generally seven years for agricultural
equipment, seven years for commercial and consumer equipment and five years for
construction and forestry equipment. The maximum term for financing leases is
generally five years, while the average term for wholesale notes is less than
twelve months.

At
October 31, 2008 and 2007, the unpaid balances of receivables administered
but not owned were $326 million and $453 million, respectively. At October 31,
2008 and 2007, worldwide financing receivables administered, which include
financing receivables administered but not owned, totaled $17,988 million and
$18,373 million, respectively.

Generally
when financing receivables become approximately 120 days delinquent, accrual of
finance income is suspended and the estimated uncollectible amount is written
off to the allowance for credit losses. Accrual of finance income is resumed
when the receivable becomes contractually current

and collection doubts are removed.
Investments in financing receivables on non-accrual status at October 31,
2008 and 2007 were $88 million and $59 million, respectively.

Total
financing receivable amounts 60 days or more past due were $45 million at October 31,
2008, compared with $46 million at October 31, 2007. These past-due
amounts represented .25 percent of the receivables financed at both October 31,
2008 and 2007. The allowance for doubtful financing receivables represented .95
percent of financing receivables outstanding at both October 31, 2008 and
2007.

In addition, at October 31,
2008 and 2007, the company’s credit operations had $189 million and $192
million, respectively, of
deposits withheld from dealers and merchants available for potential credit
losses. An analysis of the allowance for doubtful financing receivables follows
in millions of dollars:

12.

SECURITIZATION OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES

The company, as a part of its
overall funding strategy, periodically transfers certain financing receivables
(retail notes) into special purpose entities (SPEs) as part of its asset-backed
securities programs (securitizations). The structure of these transactions is
such that the transfer of the retail notes did not meet the criteria of sales
in accordance with FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities and are,
therefore, accounted for as secured borrowings. SPEs utilized in
securitizations of retail notes differ from other entities included in the
company’s consolidated statements because the assets they hold are legally
isolated. For bankruptcy analysis purposes, the company has sold the
receivables to the SPEs in a true sale and the SPEs are separate legal
entities. Use of the assets held by the SPEs is restricted by terms of the
documents governing the securitization transaction.

In
securitizations of retail notes related to secured borrowings, the retail notes
are transferred to certain SPEs which in turn issue debt to investors. The
resulting secured borrowings are included in short-term borrowings on the
balance sheet as shown in the following table. The securitized retail notes are
recorded as “Restricted financing receivables - net” on the balance sheet. The
total restricted assets on the balance sheet related to these securitizations
include the restricted financing receivables less an allowance for credit
losses, and other assets primarily representing restricted cash as shown in the
following table. The SPEs supporting the secured borrowings to which the retail
notes are transferred are consolidated unless the company is not the primary
beneficiary.


The
components of consolidated restricted assets related to secured borrowings in
securitization transactions at October 31 were as follows in millions of
dollars:

The
components of consolidated secured borrowings and other liabilities related to
securitizations at October 31 were as follows in millions of dollars:

The
secured borrowings related to these restricted securitized retail notes are
obligations that are payable as the retail notes are liquidated. Repayment of
the secured borrowings depends primarily on cash flows generated by the
restricted assets. Due to the company’s short-term credit rating, cash
collections from these restricted assets are not required to be placed into a
segregated collection account until immediately prior to the time payment is
required to the secured creditors. At October 31, 2008, the maximum
remaining term of all restricted receivables was approximately five years.

13.

OTHER RECEIVABLES

Other
receivables at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of
dollars:

14.

EQUIPMENT ON OPERATING LEASES

Operating
leases arise primarily from the leasing of John Deere equipment to retail
customers. Initial lease terms generally range from four to 60 months. Net
equipment on operating leases totaled $1,639 million and $1,705 million at October 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively. The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the leases. The accumulated depreciation on this
equipment was $471 million and $520 million at October 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The corresponding depreciation expense was $308 million in 2008,
$297 million in 2007 and $269 million in 2006.

Future
payments to be received on operating leases totaled $790 million at October 31,
2008 and are scheduled as follows in millions of dollars: 2009 – $338, 2010 –
$231, 2011 – $135, 2012 – $67 and 2013 – $19.

15.

INVENTORIES

Most
inventories owned by Deere & Company and its United States equipment
subsidiaries are valued at cost, on the “last-in, first-out” (LIFO) basis.
Remaining inventories are

generally
valued at the lower of cost, on the “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) basis, or
market. The value of gross inventories on the LIFO basis represented 64 percent
and 58 percent of worldwide gross inventories at FIFO value on October 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively. If all inventories had been valued on a FIFO
basis, estimated inventories by major classification at October 31 in
millions of dollars would have been as follows:

16. PROPERTY AND DEPRECIATION

A summary of property and
equipment for continuing operations at October 31 in millions of dollars
follows:

*

Weighted-averages

Property
and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Total property
and equipment additions in 2008, 2007 and 2006 for continuing operations were
$1,147 million, $1,064 million and $781 million and depreciation was $467

million, $402 million and $379
million, respectively. Capitalized interest was $26 million, $31 million and $6
million in the same periods, respectively. Financial Services property


and
equipment additions included above were $359 million, $476 million and $292
million in 2008, 2007 and 2006 and depreciation was $34 million, $13 million
and $8 million, respectively. The Financial Services additions were primarily
due to wind turbines related to investments in wind energy generation. Leased
property and equipment under capital leases amounting to $30 million and $23
million at October 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, is included in
property and equipment.

Capitalized
software is stated at cost less accumulated amortization, and the estimated
useful life is three years. The amounts of total capitalized software costs,
including purchased and internally developed software, classified as “Other
Assets” at October 31, 2008 and 2007 were $425 million and $345 million,
less accumulated amortization of

$288 million and $270 million, respectively. Amortization of these
software costs was $35 million in 2008, $33 million in 2007 and $32 million in
2006. Leased software assets under capital leases amounting to $31 million at October 31,
2008 is included in other assets.

The
cost of compliance with foreseeable environmental requirements has been accrued
and did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
statements.

17.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS-NET

The
amounts of goodwill by operating segment were as follows in millions of
dollars:

The
increase in goodwill in the agricultural equipment segment was due to
acquisitions of goodwill of $54 million

(see Note 1), partially offset by fluctuations in foreign currency
translation. The decrease in goodwill for the construction and forestry segment
was primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency translation.

The
components of other intangible assets are as follows in millions of dollars:

*

Weighted-averages

Other
intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. The
amortization of other intangible assets in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $20 million,
$12 million and $11 million, respectively. The estimated amortization expense
for the next five years is as follows in millions of dollars: 2009 - $24,

2010 - $23, 2011 - $20, 2012 -
$17, and 2013 - $13.

18.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Short-term
borrowings at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of
dollars:

At
October 31, 2008, Financial Services, which include Capital Corporation,
has $2,082 million of commercial paper guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
(TLGP) (see Note 29).

The
notes payable related to securitizations for Financial Services are secured by
restricted financing receivables (retail notes) on the balance sheet (see Note
12). Although these notes payable are classified as short-term since payment is
required if the retail notes are liquidated early, the payment schedule for
these borrowings of $1,682 million at October 31, 2008 based on the
expected liquidation of the retail notes in millions of dollars is as follows:
2009 - $937, 2010 - $515, 2011 - $185, 2012 - $45.

The
weighted-average interest rates on total short-term borrowings, excluding
current maturities of long-term borrowings, at October 31, 2008 and 2007
were 3.2 percent and 5.1 percent respectively. The Financial Services’
short-term borrowings represent obligations of the credit subsidiaries.

Lines
of credit available from U.S. and foreign banks were $4,548 million at October 31,
2008. Some of these credit lines are available to both Deere & Company
and Capital Corporation. At October 31, 2008, $1,534 million of these
worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused
credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding
secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were
considered to constitute utilization.

Included
in the above lines of credit was a long-term credit facility agreement for
$3.75 billion, expiring in February 2012. The agreement is mutually
extendable and the annual facility fee is not significant. The credit agreement
requires the

Capital
Corporation to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at
not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter


and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to
capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder’s equity excluding
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the
end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreement also requires the Equipment
Operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and
stockholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss))
of 65 percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter according to accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. in effect at October 31, 2006.
Under this provision, the company’s excess equity capacity and retained
earnings balance free of restriction at October 31, 2008 was $6,730
million. Alternatively under this provision, the Equipment Operations had the
capacity to incur additional debt of $12,499 million

at October 31, 2008. All of these
requirements of the credit agreement have been met during the periods included
in the financial statements.

Deere &
Company has an agreement with the Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has
agreed to continue to own at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital
stock of the Capital Corporation and to maintain the Capital Corporation’s
consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. This agreement
also obligates Deere & Company to make income maintenance payments to
the Capital Corporation

such
that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05
to 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere & Company’s obligations to make
payments to the Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of
whether the Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations
or other liabilities. Further, Deere & Company’s obligations under the
agreement are not measured by the amount of the Capital Corporation’s
indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Deere & Company’s
obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to
be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of the
Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of the Capital
Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement during the periods
included in the financial statements.

19.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES

Accounts
payable and accrued expenses at October 31 consisted of the following in
millions of dollars:

*

Primarily trade receivable valuation accounts
which are reclassified as accrued expenses by the Equipment Operations as a
result of their trade receivables being sold to Financial Services.

20.

LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

Long-term
borrowings at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of
dollars:

*

Includes fair value adjustments related to
interest rate swaps.

**

All interest rates are as of year end.


The
Financial Services’ long-term borrowings represent obligations of the credit
subsidiaries.

The
approximate principal amounts of the Equipment Operations’ long-term borrowings
maturing in each of the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows:
2009 – $9, 2010 – $313, 2011 – none, 2012 – none and 2013 – none. The
approximate principal amounts of the credit subsidiaries’

long-term borrowings maturing in each of the
next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2009 – $3,774, 2010 –
$2,933, 2011 – $2,740, 2012 –
$1,986 and 2013 – $2,175.

21.

LEASES

At
October 31, 2008, future minimum lease payments under capital leases
amounted to $57 million as follows: 2009 – $13, 2010 – $13, 2011 – $13, 2012 –
$2, 2013 – $2 and later years $14. Total rental expense for operating leases
was $165 million in 2008, $126 million in 2007 and $118 million in 2006.

At October 31, 2008, future
minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to $466 million as
follows: 2009 – $123, 2010 – $89, 2011 – $61, 2012 – $46, 2013 – $35 and later
years $112.

22.

CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

The
company generally determines its warranty liability by applying historical
claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold
and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The
historical claims rate

is
primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and current quality
developments.

The
premiums for the company’s extended warranties are primarily recognized in
income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract
period. The unamortized extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) included
in

the following table
totaled $228 million and $225 million at October 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

A
reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability and unearned premiums
in millions of dollars follows:

At
October 31, 2008, the company had approximately $180 million of guarantees
issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. and Canada related to third-party
receivables for the retail financing of John Deere equipment. The company may
recover a portion of any required payments incurred under these agreements from
repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. At October 31,
2008, the company had accrued losses of approximately $6 million under these
agreements. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October 31,
2008 was approximately seven years.

The
credit operations’ subsidiary, John Deere Risk Protection, Inc., offers
crop insurance products through a managing general agency agreement (Agreement)
with insurance companies (Insurance Carriers) rated “Excellent” by A.M.
Best Company. As a managing general agent, John Deere Risk Protection, Inc.
will receive commissions from the Insurance Carriers for selling crop insurance
to producers. The credit operations have guaranteed certain obligations under
the Agreement, including the obligation to pay the Insurance Carriers for any
uncollected premiums. At October 31, 2008, the maximum exposure for
uncollected premiums was approximately $60 million. Substantially all of the
credit operations’ crop insurance risk under the Agreement has been mitigated
by a syndicate of private reinsurance companies. The reinsurance companies are
rated “Excellent” or higher by A.M. Best Company. In the event of a
widespread catastrophic crop

failure throughout the U.S. and the default of these highly rated
private reinsurance companies on their reinsurance obligations, the credit
operations would be required to reimburse the Insurance Carriers for exposure
under the Agreement of approximately $824 million at October 31, 2008. The
credit operations believe that the likelihood of the occurrence of events that
give rise to the exposures under this Agreement is substantially remote and as a result, at October 31, 2008, the
credit operation’s accrued liability under the Agreement was not material.

At
October 31, 2008, the company had commitments of approximately $507
million for the construction and acquisition of property and equipment. At October 31,
2008, the company also had pledged or restricted assets of $133 million,
primarily as collateral for borrowings. In addition, see Note 12 for restricted
assets associated with borrowings related to securitizations.

The
company also had other miscellaneous contingent liabilities totaling
approximately $55 million at October 31, 2008, for which it believes the
probability for payment is substantially remote. The accrued liability for
these contingencies was not material at October 31, 2008.

The
company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the
normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product
liability (including asbestos related liability), retail credit, software
licensing, patent and trademark matters. Although it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of
possible loss, the company believes these unresolved legal actions will not
have a material effect on its financial statements.


23.

CAPITAL STOCK

Changes
in the common stock account in millions were as follows:

On
November 14, 2007, the stockholders of the company approved a two-for-one
stock split effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to
stockholders of record on November 26, 2007, distributed on December 3,
2007.  This stock split was recorded as
of October 31, 2007 by a transfer of $268 million from retained earnings
to common stock, representing a $1 par value for each additional share issued.  The number of common shares the company is
authorized

to issue was
also increased from 600 million to 1,200 million. The number of authorized
preferred shares, none of which has been issued, remained at nine million.

The
Board of Directors at its meeting in May 2008 authorized the repurchase of
up to $5 billion of additional common stock (129.7 million shares based on October 31,
2008 closing common stock price of $38.56 per share).  This repurchase program supplements the
previous 40 million share repurchase program, which had 13.7 million shares
remaining as of October 31, 2008, for a total of 143.4 million shares
remaining to be repurchased. Repurchases of the company’s common stock under
this plan will be made from time to time, at the company’s discretion, in the
open market.

A
reconciliation of basic and diluted income per share follows in millions,
except per share amounts:

All
stock options outstanding were included in the computation during 2008, 2007
and 2006, except 2.0 million options in 2008 and 18 thousand options in 2006
that had an antidilutive effect under the treasury stock method.

24.

STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

The
company issues stock options and restricted stock awards to key employees under
plans approved by stockholders. Restricted stock is also issued to nonemployee
directors for

their
services as directors under a plan approved by stockholders. Options are
awarded with the exercise price equal to the market price and become
exercisable in one to three years after grant. Options expire ten years after
the date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest after three years.
The company recognizes the compensation cost on these stock options and
restricted stock awards either immediately if the employee is eligible to
retire or on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire
award. According to these plans at October 31, 2008, the company is authorized to grant an
additional 16.2 million shares related to stock options or restricted stock.

The
fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using a
binomial lattice option valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on
implied volatilities from traded call options on the company’s stock. The
expected volatilities are constructed from the following three components: the
starting implied volatility of short-term call options traded within a few days
of the valuation date; the predicted implied volatility of long-term call
options; and the trend in implied volatilities over the span of the call
options’ time to maturity. The company uses historical data to estimate option
exercise behavior and employee termination within the valuation model. The
expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option
valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are
expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rates utilized for periods throughout
the contractual life of the options are based on U.S. Treasury security yields
at the time of grant.

The
assumptions used for the binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of
options follow:


Stock
option activity at October 31, 2008 and changes during 2008 in millions of
dollars and shares except for share price follow:

*

Weighted-averages

The
weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during 2008, 2007
and 2006 were $27.90, $14.10 and $10.10, respectively. The total intrinsic
values of options exercised during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $226 million, $320
million and $236 million, respectively. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, cash
received from stock option exercises was $109 million, $286 million and $328
million with tax benefits of $84 million, $119 million and $87 million,
respectively.

The
company’s nonvested restricted shares at October 31, 2008 and changes
during 2008 in millions of dollars and

shares follow:

*

Weighted-averages

During
2008, 2007 and 2006 the total share-based compensation expense was $71 million,
$82 million and $91 million with an income tax benefit recognized in net income
of $26 million, $30 million and $34 million, respectively.  At October 31, 2008, there was $28
million of total unrecognized compensation cost from share-based compensation
arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to nonvested shares.
This compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately 2 years. The total fair values of stock options and restricted
shares vested during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $74 million, $69 million and $63
million, respectively.

Prior

to adoption of the new standard, the pro-forma disclosure used a straight-line
amortization of the stock option and restricted stock expense over the vesting
period according to the prior standard, FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, which included employees eligible to retire.
Under the new standard, the awards granted after the

adoption must be recognized in expense over
the requisite service period, which is either immediate if the employee is
eligible to retire, or over the vesting period if the employee is not eligible
to retire. The amount of expense for awards granted prior to adoption of the
new standard for employees eligible to retire that continued to be amortized
over the nominal vesting period in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $1
million, $12 million and $19 million pretax, $0.6 million, $8 million and $12
million after-tax (none, $.02 per share and $.03 per share, basic and diluted),
respectively.

The
company currently uses shares which have been repurchased through its stock
repurchase programs to satisfy share option exercises. At October 31,
2008, the company had 114.1 million shares in treasury stock and 143.4 million
shares remaining to be repurchased under its current publicly announced
repurchase program (see Note 23).

25.

EMPLOYEE INVESTMENT AND SAVINGS PLANS

The
company has defined contribution plans related to employee investment and
savings plans primarily in the U.S. The company’s contributions and costs under
these plans were $126 million

in 2008, $114 million in 2007 and $100 million in 2006.

26.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS

Other
comprehensive income items under FASB Statement No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, are transactions recorded in stockholders’ equity during
the year, excluding net income and transactions with stockholders. Following
are the items included in other comprehensive income (loss) and the related tax
effects in millions of dollars:

*

Reclassification of realized gains or losses
to net income were not material.

(continued)


27.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
fair values of financial instruments that do not approximate the carrying
values in the financial statements at October 31 in millions of dollars
follow:

*

See Note 18.

Fair Value Estimates

Fair
values of the long-term financing receivables were based on the discounted
values of their related cash flows at current

market interest rates. The fair values of the
remaining financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts.

Fair values of long-term borrowings
and short-term secured borrowings were based on the discounted values of their
related cash flows at current market interest rates. Certain long-term
borrowings have been swapped to current variable interest rates. The carrying
values of these long-term borrowings include adjustments related to fair value
hedges.

Derivatives

All
derivative instruments are recorded at fair values and classified as either
other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses on the balance sheet (see
Note 1). The total amounts of the company’s derivatives at October 31,
2008 and 2007 that were recorded in other assets at fair value were $417
million and $144 million, respectively. The total amounts recorded in accounts
payable and accrued expenses at fair value for the

same periods were $129 million and $62
million, respectively.

Interest Rate Swaps

The
company enters into interest rate swap agreements primarily to more closely
match the fixed or floating interest rates of the credit operations’ borrowings
to those of the assets being funded. For interest rate swaps not designated as
hedges under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, the fair value gains or losses from these swaps are
recognized currently in interest expense, generally offsetting the interest
expense on the borrowings being hedged.

Certain interest rate swaps were
designated as hedges of future cash flows from variable interest rate
borrowings.  The effective portion of the
fair value gains or losses on these cash flow hedges are recorded in other
comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest expense as
payments are accrued and the swaps approach maturity. These amounts offset the
effects of interest rate changes on the related borrowings. Gains or losses in
other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges that have been
discontinued are amortized to interest expense over the remaining duration of
the original forecasted transaction that will still occur. The total amount of
loss recorded in other comprehensive income at October 31, 2008 that is
expected to be reclassified to interest expense in the next twelve months if
interest rates remain unchanged is approximately $12 million after-tax. These
swaps mature in

up to 31
months.

Certain interest rate swaps were
designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate, long-term borrowings. The
effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these swaps were offset
by fair value adjustments in the underlying borrowings.

Any ineffective portions of the gains
or losses on all cash flow and fair value interest rate swaps designated as
hedges were recognized currently in interest expense and were not material.
There were no gains or losses reclassified from unrealized in other
comprehensive income to realized in earnings as a result of the discontinuance
of cash flow hedges because it is probable that the original forecasted
transaction will not occur.


There
were no components of cash flow or fair value hedges that were excluded from
the assessment of effectiveness.  The cash
flows from interest rate swaps are recorded in operating activities in the
consolidated statement of cash flows.

Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts, Swaps and Options

The
company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts, swaps and options in
order to manage the currency exposure of certain receivables, liabilities,
intercompany loans and expected inventory purchases. These transactions are not
designated as hedges under FASB Statement No. 133 and the

fair value gains or losses from these foreign
currency derivatives are recognized currently in cost of sales or other
operating expenses, generally offsetting the foreign exchange gains or losses
on the exposures being managed. The cash flows from foreign exchange forward
contracts, swaps and options are recorded in operating activities in the
consolidated statement of cash flows.

28.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER
31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006

The
company’s operations are organized and reported in four major business segments
described as follows:

The
agricultural equipment segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm
equipment and related service parts – including tractors; combine, cotton and
sugarcane harvesters; tillage, seeding, nutrient management and soil
preparation machinery; sprayers; hay and forage equipment; integrated
agricultural management systems technology; and precision agricultural
irrigation equipment and supplies.

The
commercial and consumer equipment segment manufactures and distributes
equipment, products and service parts for commercial and residential uses –
including tractors for lawn, garden, commercial and utility purposes; mowing
equipment, including walk-behind mowers; golf course equipment; utility
vehicles; landscape and nursery products; irrigation equipment; and other
outdoor power products.

The
construction and forestry segment manufactures, distributes to dealers and
sells at retail a broad range of machines and service parts used in
construction, earthmoving, material handling and timber harvesting – including
backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders;
excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders;
skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders,
log harvesters and related attachments.

The
products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily
through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.

The
credit segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new
and used agricultural, commercial and consumer, and construction and forestry
equipment.  In addition, it provides
wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, provides operating
loans, finances retail revolving charge accounts, offers certain crop risk
mitigation products and invests in wind energy generation.

The
company’s tractors and implements segment and

the harvesting equipment segment have been
aggregated in the agricultural equipment segment described above since they
have similar economic characteristics as well as similar products and services,
production processes, types of customers and methods used for distribution of
their products.

Certain
operations do not meet the materiality threshold of FASB Statement No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of

an Enterprise and Related Information, and have been grouped together
as “Other.” Due to the sale of the health care operations in 2006 (see Note 2),
the health care operations were reclassified from “Other” to discontinued
operations for 2006. The
remaining “Other” category consists of certain miscellaneous service
operations.

Because
of integrated manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing
support, a substantial number of allocations must be made to determine
operating segment and geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues
represent sales of components and finance charges, which are generally based on
market prices.

Information
relating to operations by operating segment in millions of dollars follows. In
addition to the following unaffiliated sales and revenues by segment,
intersegment sales and revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: agricultural
equipment net sales of $60 million, $104 million and $138 million, construction
and forestry net sales of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million, and credit
revenues of $257 million, $276 million and $216 million, respectively.

*

Other revenues are primarily the Equipment
Operations’ revenues for finance and interest income, and other income as
disclosed in Note 30, net of certain intercompany eliminations.

(continued)


*

Operating profit of the credit business
segment includes the effect of its interest expense and foreign exchange gains
or losses.

*

Does not include finance rental income for
equipment on operating leases.

*

Includes depreciation for equipment on
operating leases.

*

Corporate assets are primarily the Equipment
Operations’ retirement benefits, deferred income tax assets, marketable
securities and cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in Note 30, net of
certain intercompany eliminations.

The
company views and has historically disclosed its operations as consisting of
two geographic areas, the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S. and Canada,
shown below in millions of dollars. No individual foreign country’s net sales
and revenues were material for disclosure purposes.

*

The percentages indicate the approximate
proportion of each amount that relates to the U.S. only and are based upon a three-year average for 2008, 2007 and
2006.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

Common stock per share sales prices from New
York Stock Exchange composite transactions quotations follow:

At October 31, 2008,
there were 27,803 holders of record of the company’s $1 par value common stock.

Quarterly information with
respect to net sales and revenues and earnings is shown in the following
schedule. The company’s fiscal year ends in October and its interim
periods (quarters) end in January, April, July and October. Such
information is shown in millions of dollars except for per share amounts.

Net income per share for each quarter must be
computed independently. As a result, their sum may not equal the total net
income per share for the year.

*   See Note 3 for “Special Items.”

Dividend
and Other Events

A quarterly dividend of $.28 per share was
declared at the Board of Directors meeting on December 10, 2008, payable
on February 2, 2009 to stockholders of record on December 31, 2008.

On December 4, 2008,
Capital Corporation and FPC Financial, f.s.b., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Capital Corporation, elected to continue to participate in the debt guaranty
program that is part of the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
(TLGP). Under the terms of the TLGP, the FDIC guarantees certain senior
unsecured debt, including term debt with maturities on or before June 30,
2012 and certain commercial paper, issued from October 13, 2008 through
and including June 30, 2009.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Deere & Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of October 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
statements of consolidated income, changes in consolidated stockholders'
equity, and consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 2008.

Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index under
Part IV, Item 15(2).

We also have audited the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of October 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.  The Company's management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that


(1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended October 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Also,
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2008, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission

.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 158

,

Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),

which changed its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement
benefits as of October 31, 2007.
