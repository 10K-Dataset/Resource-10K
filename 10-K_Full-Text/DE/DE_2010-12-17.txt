PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

Products

Deere & Company (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively called John Deere) have operations which are categorized into three major business segments.

The

agriculture and turf

segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm and turf equipment and related service parts — including large, medium and utility tractors; loaders; combines, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders; tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment and walk-behind mowers, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and commercial mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements; integrated agricultural management systems technology; precision agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies; landscape and nursery products; and other outdoor power products.

The

construction and forestry

segment manufactures, distributes to dealers and sells at retail a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving, material handling and timber harvesting — including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and related attachments.

The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.

The

credit

segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the credit segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, provides operating loans, finances retail revolving charge accounts, offers crop risk mitigation products and held residual wind energy generation investments until December 2010 (see Note 30).

John Deere’s worldwide agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations are sometimes referred to as the “Equipment Operations.” The credit and certain miscellaneous service operations are sometimes referred to as “Financial Services.”

Additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on page 21. The John Deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837. The present Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1958.

The Company’s internet address is http://www.JohnDeere.com. Through that address, the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“Securities and Exchange Commission” or “Commission”). The information contained on the Company’s website is not included in, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K.

Market Conditions and Outlook

The Company’s equipment sales are projected to increase 10 to 12 percent for fiscal year 2011 and increase about 34 percent for the first quarter, compared with the same periods in 2010. Included is an unfavorable currency translation impact of about 1 percent for the year and about 2 percent for the first quarter of 2011. Net income attributable to Deere & Company is anticipated to be approximately $2.1 billion for 2011.

Fiscal year 2011 will be a record year for new model introductions for John Deere, due in large part to the implementation of more rigorous global engine emissions standards. The Company’s earnings forecast reflects the complexity of transitioning to these new equipment models as well as increased product costs to comply with the regulations. In addition, the Company projects higher raw material costs in 2011 and a less favorable sales mix in the agriculture and turf segment.


Agriculture and Turf.

Worldwide sales of the Company’s agriculture and turf segment are forecast to increase by 7 to 9 percent for fiscal year 2011, benefiting from generally favorable global farm conditions. Farmers in most of the Company’s key markets are experiencing solid levels of income due to strong global demand for agricultural commodities, low grain stockpiles in relation to use, and high prices for crops such as corn, wheat, soybeans, sugar and cotton.

After increasing in 2010, industry farm machinery sales in the United States (U.S.) and Canada are forecast to be about the same in 2011 as a result of production limits and transitional issues associated with the broad launch of Interim Tier 4 compliant equipment.

Industry sales in Western Europe are forecast to increase 5 to 10 percent, while sales in Central Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to see moderate gains from the depressed level in 2010. Industry sales in Asia also are forecast to grow moderately.

In South America, industry sales are projected to be about the same in 2011 relative to the strong levels of 2010, although the Company’s sales in the region are expected to benefit from a broader lineup of recently introduced products.

Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be approximately the same after experiencing some recovery in 2010.

Construction and Forestry.

Worldwide sales of John Deere’s construction and forestry equipment are forecast to rise by 25 to 30 percent for fiscal year 2011. The increase reflects market conditions that are somewhat improved in relation to the relatively low level in 2010. In addition, sales to independent rental companies are expected to see further growth. World forestry markets are expected to move significantly higher as a result of improved wood and pulp prices.

Credit.

Net income in fiscal year 2011 for John Deere’s credit operations is forecast to be approximately $360 million. The forecast increase from 2010 primarily is due to growth in the portfolio.

2010 Consolidated Results Compared with 2009

Worldwide net income attributable to Deere & Company in 2010 was $1,865 million, or $4.35 per share diluted ($4.40 basic), compared with $873 million, or $2.06 per share diluted ($2.07 basic), in 2009. Included in net income for 2009 were charges of $381 million pretax ($332 million after-tax), or $.78 per share diluted and basic, related to impairment of goodwill and voluntary employee separation expenses (see Note 5). Net sales and revenues increased 13 percent to $26,005 million in 2010, compared with $23,112 million in 2009. Net sales of the Equipment Operations increased 14 percent in 2010 to $23,573 million from $20,756 million last year. The sales increase was primarily due to higher shipment volumes. The increase also included a favorable effect for foreign currency translation of 3 percent and a price increase of 2 percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 14 perc
ent in 2010. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada increased by 14 percent in 2010, which included a favorable effect of 5 percent for foreign currency translation.

Worldwide Equipment Operations had an operating profit of $2,909 million in 2010, compared with $1,365 million in 2009. The higher operating profit was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes, improved price realization, the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange and lower raw material costs, partially offset by increased postretirement costs and higher incentive compensation expenses. Last year was also affected by a goodwill impairment charge and voluntary employee separation expenses.

The Equipment Operations’ net income, including noncontrolling interests, was $1,492 million in 2010, compared with $677 million in 2009. The same operating factors mentioned above affected these results.

Net income of the Company’s Financial Services operations attributable to Deere & Company in 2010 increased to $373 million, compared with $203 million in 2009. The increase was primarily a result of improved financing spreads and a lower provision for credit losses. Additional information is presented in the discussion of the “Worldwide Credit Operations” on page 21.


The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2010 was 73.8 percent, compared with 78.3 percent last year. The decrease was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes, improved price realization, favorable effects of foreign currency exchange and lower raw material costs. A larger goodwill impairment charge and voluntary employee separation expenses also affected last year’s ratio.

Additional information on 2010 results is presented on pages 20 - 21.

EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS

Agriculture and Turf

The John Deere agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of agricultural and turf equipment and related service parts. The segment’s global operating model is designed to enable faster geographic growth and increase the segment’s competitiveness. Pursuant to this model, the segment consolidates all markets into four customer focus areas to facilitate comprehensive customer understanding and deliver optimal customer service. As an additional component of the global operating model, the segment’s equipment operations are consolidated into five product platforms — crop harvesting (combines, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and sugarcane loaders); turf and utility (utility vehicles, riding lawn equipment, walk behind mowers, commercial mowing equipment, golf course equipment, implements for mowing, tilling, snow and d
ebris handling, aerating and many other residential, commercial, golf and sports turf care applications; and other outdoor power products); hay and forage (self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers); crop care (tillage, seeding and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery); and tractors (loaders and large, medium and utility tractors). John Deere also purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale. Additionally, the segment offers ancillary products and services supporting its agricultural and turf equipment customers. John Deere Landscapes, a unit of the segment, distributes irrigation equipment, nursery products and landscape supplies, including seed, fertilizer and hardscape materials, primarily to landscape service professionals. John Deere Water, also a unit of the agriculture and turf segment, manufactures and distributes precision agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies.

The segment also provides integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems. John Deere has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced communications, data collection and global satellite positioning technologies to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields, improve soil conservation and minimize chemical use and to gather information. Recently introduced advanced telematics systems remotely connect agricultural equipment owners, business managers and dealers to agricultural equipment in the field, providing real-time alerts and information about equipment location, utilization, performance and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency.

In addition to the John Deere brand, the agriculture and turf segment manufactures and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the Frontier brand name, walk-behind mowers and scarifiers in Europe under the SABO brand name, and tractors in China under the Benye brand name. John Deere manufactures its agricultural and turf equipment for sale primarily through independent retail dealer networks, and also builds products for sale by mass retailers, including The Home Depot and Lowe’s.

Sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields and governmental policies, including the amount and timing of government payments. Sales are also influenced by general economic conditions, farm land prices, farmers’ debt levels and access to financing, interest and exchange rates, agricultural trends, including the production of and demand for renewable fuels, energy costs and other input costs associated with farming. Other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment, including tractors, harvesting equipment, self-propelled sprayers, hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment. Weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers.

Innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing. For example, larger, more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations. Large, cost-efficient, highly-mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output. The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to John Deere. A large proportion of the Equipment Operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada, and a growing proportion of sales in many countries outside the U.S. and Canada, is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower, self-propelled combines, self-propelled cotton pickers, self-propelled forage harvesters, self-propelled


sprayers and seeding equipment. However, as John Deere expands its business globally, especially in developing countries where demand for smaller equipment is greater, John Deere’s sales of tractors below 100 horsepower have increased.

Retail sales of lawn and garden tractors, compact utility tractors, residential and commercial mowers, utility vehicles, and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions, consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions.

Seasonality

. Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year. Seasonal demand must be estimated in advance, and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year. For certain equipment, John Deere offers early order discounts to retail customers. Production schedules are based, in part, on these early order programs. The segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment. The segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand. New combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order 
programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during off-season periods. In the U.S. and Canada, there are typically several used equipment trade-in transactions for most new agricultural equipment sales. To provide support to the Company’s dealers for these used equipment trade-ins, John Deere provides dealers with a pool of funds, awarded to dealers as a percentage of the dealer cost for certain new eligible equipment sales. Dealers can use these funds to defray the costs of carrying or marketing used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment.

Retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third quarters. John Deere is pursuing a strategy of building and shipping as close to retail demand as possible. Consequently, to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year, production and shipment schedules of these product lines will normally be proportionately higher in the second and third quarters of each year, corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales.

Construction and Forestry

John Deere construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment includes a broad range of backhoe loaders, crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, motor graders, articulated dump trucks, landscape loaders, skid-steer loaders, log skidders, log feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and a variety of attachments. John Deere provides the most complete line of forestry machines and attachments available in the world. The segment’s forestry machines are distributed under the John Deere brand name and forestry attachments are distributed under the John Deere and Waratah brand names. In addition to the equipment manufactured by the construction and forestry segment, John Deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale. The segment also provides comprehensive fleet management telematics solutions designed to improve customer produc
tivity and efficiency through access to fleet location, utilization and maintenance information.

The prevailing levels of residential, commercial and public construction and the condition of the forest products industry influence retail sales of John Deere construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment. General economic conditions, the level of interest rates, the availability of credit and certain commodity prices such as those applicable to pulp, paper and saw logs also influence sales.

Pursuant to agreements between John Deere and Bell Equipment Limited (Bell), Bell and John Deere collaborate to design articulated dump trucks which are manufactured by John Deere in the U.S. for John Deere’s distribution under the John Deere brand name in North, Central and South America. John Deere licenses Bell to manufacture and sell certain John Deere-designed construction equipment in specified territories of Africa. Bell is also the distributor of certain John Deere manufactured construction equipment under the Bell brand name and forestry equipment under the John Deere brand name in certain territories of Africa.

John Deere and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (Hitachi) have a joint venture for the manufacture of hydraulic excavators and track log loaders in the U.S. and Canada. John Deere distributes Hitachi brands of construction and mining equipment in North, Central and South America. John Deere also has supply agreements with Hitachi under which a range of construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry products manufactured by John Deere in the U.S., Finland and New Zealand are distributed by Hitachi in certain Asian markets.


John Deere has expanded the construction and forestry segment’s business outside of the U.S. and Canada by entering into a joint venture in China with Xuzhou Bohui Science & Technology Development CO. Ltd. (Xuzhou) known as Xuzhou XCG John Deere Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Xuzhou XCG), and by establishing manufacturing capacity for construction and forestry equipment in Russia in 2010 and construction equipment in India in 2011 through Ashok Leyland John Deere Construction Equipment Company Private Limited (Ashok Leyland), its joint venture with Ashok Leyland Limited.

The segment has a number of initiatives in the rent-to-rent, or short-term rental, market for construction, earthmoving and material handling equipment. These include specially designed rental programs for John Deere dealers and expanded cooperation with major, national equipment rental companies.

John Deere also owns Nortrax, Inc. and Nortrax Canada Inc. (collectively called Nortrax). Nortrax is an authorized John Deere dealer for construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment in a variety of markets in the U.S. and Canada. John Deere also owns retail forestry sales operations in Australia, Brazil, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Competition

The Equipment Operations sell products and services into a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. The principal competitive factors in all markets include product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. In North America and many other parts of the world, John Deere’s brand recognition is a competitive factor.

The competitive environment for the agriculture and turf segment includes some global competitors, including AGCO Corporation, CNH Global N.V., Kubota Tractor Corporation and The Toro Company, and many regional and local competitors. These competitors have varying numbers of product lines competing with the segment’s products and each have varying degrees of regional focus. An important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse variety of short-line and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. Because of industry conditions, including the merger of certain large integrated competitors and the emergence and expanding global capability of many competitors, particularly in emerging and high potential markets such as Brazil, China, India and Russia where John Deere seeks to increase market share
, the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and is becoming even more competitive. John Deere has continued to increase its global manufacturing capacity to compete in these markets. The segment’s turf equipment is sold primarily in the highly competitive North American and Western European markets. The agriculture and turf segment’s global operating model is designed to enhance the segment’s competitive position by reducing complexity, implementing standard processes and increasing customer focus, speed and flexibility while building on the segment’s broad global reach and deep understanding of the agriculture and turf care markets.

The construction and forestry segment operates in highly competitive North American and global markets, and is seeking to grow its competitive position in other parts of the world, including Brazil, China, India and Russia. Global competitors of the construction and forestry segment include Caterpillar Inc., Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of Volvo Group AB), CNH Global N.V., Tigercat Industries Inc. and Ponsse Plc. The segment provides equipment that competes for over 90 percent of the estimated total North American market for the size categories of construction, earthmoving and material handling equipment that John Deere manufactures.

Engineering and Research

John Deere invests heavily in engineering and research to improve the quality and performance of its products and to develop new products. Such expenditures were $1,052 million or 4.5 percent of net sales of equipment in 2010, $977 million or 4.7 percent in 2009 and $943 million or 3.7 percent in 2008.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing Plants

. In the U.S. and Canada, the Equipment Operations own and operate 18 factory locations and lease and operate another four locations, which contain approximately 26.7 million square feet of floor space. Of these 22 factories, 15 are devoted primarily to agriculture and turf equipment, two to construction and forestry equipment, one to engines, two to engine remanufacturing and two to hydraulic and power train components. Outside the U.S. and Canada, the Equipment Operations own or lease and operate: agriculture and turf equipment


factories in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia and Spain; engine factories in Argentina, France, India and Mexico; and forestry equipment factories in Finland and New Zealand. In addition, John Deere Water has manufacturing operations outside of North America in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, France, India, Israel and Spain. These factories and manufacturing operations outside the U.S. and Canada contain approximately 17.3 million square feet of floor space. The engine factories referred to above manufacture non-road, heavy duty diesel engines a majority of which are manufactured for John Deere’s Equipment Operations. The remaining engines are sold to other regional and global original equipment manufacturers.

The Equipment Operations also have financial interests in other manufacturing organizations, which include agricultural equipment manufacturers in the U.S., an industrial truck manufacturer in South Africa, the Hitachi joint venture that builds hydraulic excavators and track log loaders in the U.S. and Canada, the Xuzhou XCG joint venture that builds excavators, the Ashok Leyland joint venture that will begin building backhoes and four-wheel-drive loaders in 2011, ventures that manufacture transaxles and transmissions used in certain agriculture and turf segment products and a venture that remanufactures turbochargers, diesel particulate filters and electronics.

John Deere’s facilities are well maintained, in good operating condition and are suitable for their present purposes. These facilities, together with both short-term and long-term planned capital expenditures, are expected to meet John Deere’s manufacturing needs in the foreseeable future.

Capacity is adequate to satisfy John Deere’s current expectations for retail market demand. The Equipment Operations’ manufacturing strategy involves the implementation of appropriate levels of technology and automation to allow manufacturing processes to remain profitable at varying production levels. Operations are also designed to be flexible enough to accommodate the product design changes required to meet market conditions. Common manufacturing facilities and techniques are employed in the production of components for agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment.

In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, the Equipment Operations pursue continuous improvements in manufacturing processes. These include steps to streamline manufacturing processes and enhance responsiveness to customers. John Deere has implemented flexible assembly lines that can accommodate a wider product mix and deliver products in line with dealer and customer demand. Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing technology, enhanced environmental management systems, supply management and logistics as well as compensation incentives related to productivity and organizational structure. In recent years, John Deere has experienced volatility in the price of many raw materials. John Deere has responded to cost pressures by implementing the cost-reduction measures des
cribed above and increasing prices. Significant cost increases, if they occur, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results. The Equipment Operations also pursue external sales of selected parts and components that can be manufactured and supplied to third parties on a competitive basis.

Capital Expenditures.

The Equipment Operations’ capital expenditures totaled $796 million in 2010, compared with $772 million in 2009 and $781 million in 2008. Provisions for depreciation applicable to these operations’ property and equipment during these years were $477 million, $450 million and $432 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for the Equipment Operations in 2011 are currently estimated to be approximately $1,000 million. The 2011 expenditures will relate primarily to U.S. Tier 4 emission requirements, the modernization and restructuring of key manufacturing facilities, and the development of new products. Future levels of capital expenditures will depend on business conditions.

Patents and Trademarks

John Deere owns a significant number of patents, trade secrets, licenses and trademarks related to John Deere products and services, and expects the number to grow as John Deere continues to pursue technological innovations. John Deere’s policy is to further its competitive position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and internationally to protect technology and improvements considered important to the business. The Company believes that, in the aggregate, the rights under these patents and licenses are generally important to its operations and competitive position, but does not regard any of its businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. However, certain John Deere trademarks, which contribute to John Deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the “John Deere” mark, the leaping deer logo, the “No
thing Runs Like a Deere” slogan and green and yellow equipment colors, are an integral part of John Deere’s business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on John Deere.


Marketing

In the U.S. and Canada, the Equipment Operations distribute equipment and service parts through the following facilities: two agriculture and turf equipment sales and administration offices located in Lenexa, Kansas and Cary, North Carolina and one sales branch located in Grimsby, Ontario; and one construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment sales and administration office located in Moline, Illinois. In addition, the Equipment Operations operate a centralized parts distribution warehouse in coordination with eight regional parts depots and distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada.

Through these U.S. and Canadian facilities, John Deere markets products to approximately 2,526 dealer locations, most of which are independently owned. Of these, approximately 1,551 sell agricultural equipment, while 416 sell construction, earthmoving, material handling and/or forestry equipment. Nortrax owns some of the 416 dealer locations. Turf equipment is sold at most John Deere agricultural equipment locations, a few construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment locations, and about 559 turf-only locations, many of which also sell dissimilar lines of non-John Deere products. In addition, certain lawn and garden product lines are sold through The Home Depot and Lowe’s. John Deere Landscapes operates its business from approximately 447 branch locations throughout the U.S. and Canada.

Outside the U.S. and Canada, John Deere agriculture and turf equipment is sold to distributors and dealers for resale in over 100 countries. Sales and administrative offices are located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Associated companies doing business in China also sell agricultural equipment. Turf equipment sales outside the U.S. and Canada occur primarily in Europe and Australia. Construction, earthmoving, material handling and forestry equipment is sold to distributors and dealers primarily by sales offices located in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Finland, New Zealand, Russia and Singapore. Some of these dealers are independently owned while John Deere owns others. The Equipment Operations operate centralized parts distribution warehouses in Brazil, Germany and
 Russia in coordination with regional parts depots and distribution centers in Argentina, Australia, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

John Deere Water operates from 22 sales and marketing locations and 23 warehousing locations in 14 countries including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, France, India, Israel, Peru, Spain, Turkey and the U.S. Its products are marketed through approximately 1,500 independent dealers and distributors in over 100 countries.

John Deere engines are marketed worldwide through select sales branches to large original equipment manufacturers and independently owned engine distributors.

Raw Materials

John Deere purchases raw materials and some manufactured components and replacement parts for its equipment, engines and other products from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. These materials and components include a variety of steel products, steel and iron castings, forgings and ready to assemble components made to certain specifications. John Deere also purchases various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and research and development processes. John Deere maintains strategic sourcing models to meet its production needs and build upon long-term supplier relationships. John Deere uses a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to drive innovation, ensure availability and delivery of industry-leading quality raw materials and components, manage costs on a globally competitive basis, protect John Deere’s intellectual property and minimize othe
r supply-related risks. Supplier-related risks monitored by John Deere to minimize the likelihood of the supply base causing business disruption include supplier financial viability, business continuity, quality and delivery. In fiscal year 2010, John Deere experienced no significant work stoppages as a result of shortages of raw materials or other commodities.

Backlog Orders

The dollar amount of backlog orders for the agriculture and turf segment believed to be firm was approximately $4.3 billion at October 31, 2010, compared with $3.6 billion at October 31, 2009. The agriculture and turf backlog is generally highest in the second and third quarters due to seasonal buying trends in these industries. John Deere generally produces and ships its construction and forestry equipment on average within approximately 60 days after


an order is deemed to become firm. Therefore, no significant amount of construction and forestry backlog orders accumulates during any period.

Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable

Trade accounts and notes receivable arise primarily from sales of goods to independent dealers. Most trade receivables originated by the Equipment Operations are purchased by Financial Services. The Equipment Operations compensate Financial Services at market rates of interest for these receivables. Additional information appears in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

Credit Operations

U.S. and Canada

. The Company’s credit segment (collectively referred to as the Credit Companies) primarily provide and administer financing for retail purchases from John Deere dealers of new equipment manufactured by the Company’s agriculture and turf and construction and forestry divisions and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. In the U.S., certain subsidiaries included in the credit segment also offer crop risk mitigation products.

The Company and John Deere Construction & Forestry Company are referred to as the “sales companies.” John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a U.S. credit subsidiary, generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. These retail notes are acquired by the sales companies through John Deere retail dealers in the U.S. John Deere Credit Inc., a Canadian credit subsidiary, purchases and finances retail notes acquired by John Deere Limited, the Company’s Canadian sales branch. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the Credit Companies acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with the sales companies. The Credit Companies also finance and service revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agriculture and turf and construction and fores
try markets (revolving charge accounts). Further, the Credit Companies finance and service operating loans, in most cases offered through and acquired from farm input providers or through direct relationships with agricultural producers or agribusinesses (operating loans). Additionally, the Credit Companies provide wholesale financing for inventories of John Deere agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment owned by dealers of those products (wholesale notes). The various financing options offered by the Credit Companies are designed to enhance sales of John Deere products and generate financing income for the Credit Companies.

Retail notes acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the Credit Companies. The Equipment Operations are the Credit Companies’ major source of business, but many retail purchasers of John Deere products finance their purchases outside the John Deere organization through a variety of sources, including commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.

The Credit Companies offer retail leases to equipment users in the U.S. A small number of leases are executed with units of local government. Leases are usually written for periods of two to five years, and typically contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail leases are also offered in a generally similar manner to customers in Canada through John Deere Credit Inc. and John Deere Limited.

The Credit Companies’ terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items financed with unsecured revolving charge accounts) provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed. The Credit Companies’ guidelines for minimum down payments, which vary with the types of equipment and repayment provisions, are generally not less than 20 percent on agricultural equipment, 10 percent on construction and forestry equipment and 10 percent on turf care equipment used for personal use. Finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain John Deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions. The Credit Companies generally receive compensation from the sales companies equal to a competitive interest rate for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases. The cost is 
accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by the Equipment Operations.

The Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation to make income maintenance payments to Capital Corporation such that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any fiscal quarter. For 2010 and 2009, Capital Corporation’s ratios were 1.89 to 1 and 1.28 to 1, respectively, and never less than 1.61 to 1 and


1.12 to 1 for any fiscal quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company has also committed to continue to own at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. The Company’s obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, the Company’s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporation’s indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. The Company’s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corpo
ration. No payments were required under this agreement in 2010 or 2009.

Outside the U.S. and Canada

. The Credit Companies also offer financing, primarily for John Deere products, in Australia, New Zealand, Russia, and in several countries in Europe and in Latin America. In certain areas, financing is offered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures. Financing outside of the U.S. and Canada is affected by a variety of customs and regulations.

The Credit Companies also offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export financing for the purchase of John Deere products.

Capital Expenditures

. The credit operations’ capital expenditures (cost reductions) totaled $(1) million in 2010, compared with $(5) million in 2009 and $337 million in 2008. The capital expenditures for 2010 and 2009 were more than offset by cost reductions due to becoming eligible for government grants for certain wind energy investments related to costs recognized in prior and current periods. Provisions for depreciation applicable to these operations’ property and equipment during these years were $64 million, $62 million and $34 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for the credit operations in 2011 are not expected to be significant. The Company sold the wind energy business for approximately $900 million after year end (see Notes 4 and 30).

Additional information on the Credit Companies appears on pages 21, 22, 24, 26 and 27.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

John Deere is subject to a wide variety of state, federal and international environmental laws, rules and regulations. These laws, rules and regulations may affect the way John Deere conducts its operations and failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties. John Deere is also involved in the evaluation and clean-up of a limited number of sites. Management does not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. With respect to acquired properties and businesses, John Deere cannot be certain that it has identified all adverse environmental conditions. John Deere expects that it will acquire additional properties and businesses in the future.

EMPLOYEES

At October 31, 2010, John Deere had approximately 55,700 full-time employees, including approximately 29,400 employees in the U.S. and Canada. From time to time, John Deere also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 37 percent of John Deere’s U.S. employees. Most of the Company’s U.S. production and maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW), with an expiration date of October 1, 2015.

Unions also represent the majority of employees at John Deere manufacturing facilities outside the U.S.


EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

Following are the names and ages of the executive officers of the Company, their positions with the Company and summaries of their backgrounds and business experience. All executive officers are elected or appointed by the Board of Directors and hold office until the annual meeting of the Board of Directors following the annual meeting of stockholders in each year.


ITEM 1A.              RISK FACTORS.

The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deere’s business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 20 and, specifically, the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 22 and 23.

International, regional and national trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies, could significantly impact John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects

.

International, regional and national laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting trade, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deere’s multinational business. John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Open access to global markets improves John Deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and affects the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions could limit John Deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. Fur
thermore, the ability to export commodities is critical to John Deere’s agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities, including the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, could have a material effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities which may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially affected because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world.

Trade restrictions could also impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure.

Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.

Changes in policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies to promote liquidity and increase the availability of credit may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deere’s customers and markets. John Deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform which could have an adverse affect on the credit segment and/or John Deere’s customers by limiting their ability to finance purchases of John Deere products. Governmental policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development.

Changing worldwide demand for food and for different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.

Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices may benefit John Deere’s crop producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by those customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands.  Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deere’s gasoline- or diesel-fueled equipment and result in hi
gher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.


As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses which could significantly change the dynamics of John Deere’s competition, customer base and product offerings.

John Deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in, additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, Russia, India and China. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than John Deere’s other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change; increased exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Company’s financial results and differing local customer product preferences and product requirements. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors 
are seeking to expand their production capacities in these same markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, particularly by focusing on gaining customer understanding in high-growth potential emerging markets, John Deere’s business efforts could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.

Negative economic conditions and outlook can

materially weaken demand for John Deere’s equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs.

The demand for John Deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower business investment. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Company’s earnings and cash flows. The Company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. General economic conditions can affect the demand for John Deere’s equipment. Sustained or severe negative economic conditions and outlook resulting in decreased housing starts and other construction can dampen demand for certain construction equipment. John Deere’s turf operations and construction and forestry segment are dependent on construc
tion activity and positive general economic conditions. Significant or prolonged declines in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. If negative economic conditions extend to the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on agricultural equipment sales.

The Company’s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk.

The reporting currency for the Company’s consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of the Company’s assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on the Company’s results.

Because the credit segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere sales worldwide, John Deere’s operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry.

In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the credit segment operates. The credit segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere sales worldwide. The credit segment’s inability to access funds to support its financing activities to John Deere’s customers could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business. The credit segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, sustained negative market conditions could further reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the credit segment’s write-
offs and provisions for credit losses.


If John Deere’s customers lack confidence in the general economic outlook, they are less likely to purchase John Deere’s products.

The attitudes of consumers about general economic conditions and outlook can significantly affect their propensity to purchase John Deere equipment. Continuing or worsening negative economic conditions could significantly impair customer confidence and result in reduced equipment sales.

John Deere’s business results depend largely on its ability to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand.

John Deere’s ability to match its new product offerings to its customers’ anticipated preferences for enhanced technologies and different types and sizes of equipment is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis. Failure to deliver quality products at competitive prices to meet customer demands before competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deere’s business.

John Deere’s business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agricultural and turf equipment.

Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deere’s customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can also prevent planting from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes, or other storms, and droughts can have significan
t negative effects on agricultural production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. Sales of turf care equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes.

Changes in the availability and price of raw materials can result in increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products

.

John Deere requires access to various raw materials at competitive prices to manufacture its products. Changes in the availability and price of raw materials, which are more likely to occur during times of economic volatility, can significantly increase the costs of production which would have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business.

John Deere’s Equipment Operations and credit segment are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.

Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deere’s customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and/or customers’ ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to the Company’s credit segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. In addition, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Company’s net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative c
hanges to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.


John Deere’s operations are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental,

health and safety laws and regulations

of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deere’s international operations.

In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S.

Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deere’s operations, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deere’s operations, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results.

Beginning in 2011, John Deere’s Equipment Operations must meet new and increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, including Interim Tier 4 and Stage IIIb nonroad diesel emission requirements applicable to many engines manufactured by John Deere and used in many models of John Deere agricultural and construction and forestry equipment. In order to meet these standards, John Deere has incurred substantial research and development costs and in fiscal year 2011 will introduce a record number of new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, and does not currently foresee obstacles that would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deere’s ability to distribute certain equipment or e
ngines, which could negatively impact business results.

John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers.

There is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”) continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the near future. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs (which would increase John Deere’s operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials 
costs). The regulation of GHG emissions from non-road sources could require further changes to the design of John Deere’s engines and equipment. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of the mandate or standard, John Deere is unable to predict its significance at this time.

Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deere’s facilities, suppliers and customers, and therefore on John Deere’s operations, are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deere’s operations.

None.

ITEM 2.                  PROPERTIES.

See “Manufacturing” in Item 1.


The Equipment Operations own or lease nine facilities housing one centralized parts distribution center and eight regional parts depots and distribution centers throughout the U.S. and Canada. These facilities contain approximately 4.6 million square feet of floor space. Outside the U.S. and Canada the Equipment Operations also own or lease and occupy buildings housing three centralized parts distribution centers in Brazil, Germany and Russia and regional parts depots and distribution centers in Argentina, Australia, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom. These facilities contain approximately 2.2 million square feet of floor space.

Deere & Company administrative offices and research facilities, all of which are owned by John Deere, together contain about 2.6 million square feet of floor space and miscellaneous other facilities total 1.1 million square feet.

Overall, John Deere owns approximately 50 million square feet of facilities and leases approximately 14.5 million additional square feet in various locations.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

John Deere is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos-related liability), retail credit, software licensing, patent and trademark matters. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, John Deere believes these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect on its financial statements.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2010,
2009 AND 2008

OVERVIEW

Organization

The company’s Equipment
Operations generate revenues and cash primarily from the sale of equipment to
John Deere dealers and distributors. The Equipment Operations manufacture and
distribute a full line of agricultural equipment; a variety of commercial,
consumer and landscapes equipment and products; and a broad range of equipment
for construction and forestry. The company’s Financial Services primarily
provide credit services, which mainly finance sales and leases of equipment by
John Deere dealers and trade receivables purchased from the Equipment
Operations. In addition, Financial Services offer crop risk mitigation products.
The information in the following discussion is presented in a format that
includes information grouped as consolidated, Equipment Operations and
Financial Services. The company also views its operations as consisting of two
geographic areas, the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S. and Canada. The
company’s reportable operating segments consist of agriculture and turf,
construction and forestry, and credit.

Trends and
Economic Conditions

Industry farm machinery
sales in the U.S. and Canada for 2011 are forecast to be approximately the same
as 2010. Industry sales in Western Europe are forecast to increase 5 to 10
percent, while South American industry sales are projected to be approximately
the same. Industry sales in Central Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent
States are expected to have moderate gains. Industry sales of turf and utility
equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be approximately the same. The
company’s agriculture and turf equipment sales increased 10 percent in 2010 and
are forecast to increase by 7 to 9 percent for 2011. Construction equipment
markets are forecast to be somewhat improved, while global forestry markets are
expected to move significantly higher in 2011. The company’s construction and
forestry sales increased 41 percent in 2010 and are forecast to increase by 25
to 30 percent in 2011. Net income for the company’s credit operations in 2011
is forecast to increase to approximately $360 million.

Items of concern include the
uncertainty of the global economic recovery, the impact of sovereign and state
debt, capital market disruptions, the availability of credit for the company’s
customers and suppliers, the effectiveness of governmental actions in respect
to monetary policies, trade and general economic conditions, and financial
regulatory reform. Significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
and volatility in the price of many commodities could also impact the company’s
results. The availability of certain components that could impact the company’s
ability to meet production schedules continues to be monitored. Designing and
producing products with engines that continue to meet high performance
standards and increasingly stringent engine emissions regulations is one of the
company’s major priorities.

The company’s strong
performance for the year reflects a disciplined approach to executing the
company’s business plans and was achieved despite continuing weakness in
certain regions and business sectors. Although conditions continued to be positive
in the U.S. farm sector, European agricultural markets remained soft. The
company’s construction equipment sales benefited from somewhat stronger overall
demand, but remained far below normal levels. With the company’s performance in
2010, it remains well positioned to capitalize on positive global economic
trends.

2010 COMPARED WITH 2009

CONSOLIDATED
RESULTS

Worldwide net income
attributable to Deere & Company in 2010 was $1,865 million, or $4.35
per share diluted ($4.40 basic), compared with $873 million, or $2.06 per share
diluted ($2.07 basic), in 2009. Included in net income for 2009 were charges of
$381 million pretax ($332 million after-tax), or $.78 per share diluted and
basic, related to impairment of goodwill and voluntary employee separation
expenses (see Note 5). Net sales and revenues increased 13 percent to $26,005
million in 2010, compared with $23,112 million in 2009. Net sales of the
Equipment Operations increased 14 percent in 2010 to $23,573 million from
$20,756 million last year. The sales increase was primarily due to higher
shipment volumes. The increase also included a favorable effect for foreign
currency translation of 3 percent and a price increase of 2 percent. Net sales
in the U.S. and Canada increased 14 percent in 2010. Net sales outside the U.S.
and Canada increased by 14 percent in 2010, which included a favorable effect
of 5 percent for foreign currency translation.

Worldwide Equipment
Operations had an operating profit of $2,909 million in 2010, compared with
$1,365 million in 2009. The higher operating profit was primarily due to higher
shipment and production volumes, improved price realization, the favorable
effects of foreign currency exchange and lower raw material costs, partially
offset by increased postretirement costs and higher incentive compensation
expenses. Last year was also affected by a goodwill impairment charge and
voluntary employee separation expenses.

The Equipment Operations’
net income, including noncontrolling interests, was $1,492 million in 2010,
compared with $677 million in 2009. The same operating factors mentioned above
affected these results.

Net income of the company’s
Financial Services operations attributable to Deere & Company in 2010
increased to $373 million, compared with $203 million in 2009. The increase was
primarily a result of improved financing spreads and a lower provision for
credit losses. Additional information is presented in the following discussion
of the “Worldwide Credit Operations.”

The cost of sales to net
sales ratio for 2010 was 73.8 percent, compared with 78.3 percent last year.
The decrease was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes,
improved price realization, favorable effects of foreign currency exchange and
lower raw material costs. A larger goodwill impairment charge and voluntary
employee separation expenses affected last year’s ratio.


Finance and interest income
decreased this year due to lower financing rates, partially offset by a larger
average portfolio. Other income increased primarily as a result of an increase
in wind energy income, higher commissions from crop insurance and higher
service revenues. Research and development expenses increased primarily as a
result of increased spending in support of new products including designing and
producing products with engines to meet more stringent emissions regulations.
Selling, administrative and general expenses increased primarily due to
increased incentive compensation expenses, higher postretirement benefit costs
and the effect of foreign currency translation. Interest expense decreased due
to lower average borrowing rates and lower average borrowings. Other operating
expenses increased primarily due to the write-down of wind energy assets
classified as held for sale (see Notes 4 and 30). The equity in income of
unconsolidated affiliates increased as a result of higher income from
construction equipment manufacturing affiliates due to increased levels of
construction activity.

The company has several
defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life
insurance plans. The company’s postretirement benefit costs for these plans in
2010 were $658 million, compared with $312 million in 2009, primarily due to a
decrease in discount rates. The long-term expected return on plan assets, which
is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain of 8.2 percent in 2010 and
2009, or $883 million in 2010 and $857 million in 2009. The actual return was a
gain of $1,273 million in 2010 and $1,142 million in 2009. In 2011, the
expected return will be approximately 8.0 percent. The company expects
postretirement benefit costs in 2011 to be approximately the same as 2010. The
company makes any required contributions to the plan assets under applicable
regulations and voluntary contributions from time to time based on the
company’s liquidity and ability to make tax-deductible contributions. Total
company contributions to the plans were $836 million in 2010 and $358 million
in 2009, which include direct benefit payments for unfunded plans. These
contributions also included voluntary contributions to total plan assets of
approximately $650 million in 2010 and $150 million in 2009. Total company
contributions in 2011 are expected to be approximately $316 million, which
include direct benefit payments. The company has no significant contributions
to pension plan assets required in 2011 under applicable funding regulations.
See the following discussion of “Critical Accounting Policies” for more information
about postretirement benefit obligations.

BUSINESS
SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS

The following discussion
relates to operating results by reportable segment and geographic area.
Operating profit is income before certain external interest expense, certain
foreign exchange gains or losses, income taxes and corporate expenses. However,
operating profit of the credit segment includes the effect of interest expense
and foreign currency exchange gains or losses.

Worldwide
Agriculture and Turf Operations

The agriculture and turf
segment had an operating profit of $2,790 million in 2010, compared with $1,448
million in 2009. Net sales increased 10 percent this year primarily due to
higher production and shipment volumes. Sales also increased due to foreign
currency translation and improved price realization. The increase in operating
profit was due to increased shipment and production volumes, improved price
realization, the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange and lower raw
material costs, partially offset by higher postretirement benefit costs and
increased incentive compensation expenses. Last year’s results were affected by
a goodwill impairment charge and voluntary employee separation expenses.

Worldwide
Construction and Forestry Operations

The construction and
forestry segment had an operating profit of $119 million in 2010, compared with
a loss of $83 million in 2009. Net sales increased 41 percent for the year due
to higher shipment and production volumes. The operating profit improvement in
2010 was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes, partially
offset by higher postretirement benefit costs and increased incentive
compensation expenses.

Worldwide
Credit Operations

The operating profit of the
credit operations was $465 million in 2010, compared with $223 million in 2009.
The increase in operating profit was primarily due to improved financing
spreads and a lower provision for credit losses. Total revenues of the credit
operations, including intercompany revenues, increased 1 percent in 2010,
primarily reflecting the larger portfolio. The average balance of receivables
and leases financed was 5 percent higher in 2010, compared with 2009. Interest
expense decreased 28 percent in 2010 as a result of lower borrowing rates and
lower average borrowings. The credit operations’ ratio of earnings to fixed
charges was 1.72 to 1 in 2010, compared with 1.24 to 1 in 2009.

Equipment
Operations in U.S. and Canada

The equipment operations in
the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $2,302 million in 2010, compared
with $1,129 million in 2009. The increase was due to higher shipment and
production volumes, improved price realization and lower raw material costs,
partially offset by increased postretirement benefit costs and higher incentive
compensation expenses. Last year’s operating profit was affected by a goodwill
impairment charge and voluntary employee separation expenses. Net sales
increased 14 percent primarily due to higher volumes and improved price
realization. The physical volume increased 10 percent, compared with 2009.

Equipment
Operations outside U.S. and Canada

The equipment operations
outside the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $607 million in 2010,
compared with $236 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to the
effects of higher shipment and production volumes, the favorable effects of
foreign currency exchange rates, improved price realization and decreases in
raw material costs, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expenses.
Net sales were 14 percent higher primarily reflecting increased volumes and the
effect of foreign currency translation. The physical volume increased 8
percent, compared with 2009.


MARKET
CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK

Company equipment sales are
projected to increase 10 to 12 percent for fiscal year 2011 and increase about
34 percent for the first quarter, compared with the same periods in 2010.
Included is an unfavorable currency translation impact of about 1 percent for
the year and about 2 percent for the first quarter of 2011. Net income
attributable to Deere & Company is anticipated to be approximately
$2.1 billion for the year.

Fiscal year 2011 will be a
record year for new model introductions for the company, due in large part to
the implementation of more rigorous global engine emissions standards. The
company’s earnings forecast reflects the complexity of transitioning to these
new equipment models as well as increased product costs to comply with the
regulations. In addition, the company projects higher raw material costs in
2011 and a less favorable sales mix in the agriculture and turf segment.

Agriculture
and Turf.

Worldwide sales of the company’s agriculture and
turf segment are forecast to increase by 7 to 9 percent for fiscal year 2011,
benefiting from generally favorable global farm conditions. Farmers in most of
the company’s key markets are experiencing solid levels of income due to strong
global demand for agricultural commodities, low grain stock-piles in relation
to use, and high prices for crops such as corn, wheat, soybeans, sugar and
cotton.

After increasing in 2010,
industry farm machinery sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be about
the same in 2011 as a result of production limits and transitional issues
associated with the broad launch of Interim Tier 4 compliant equipment.

Industry sales in Western
Europe are forecast to increase 5 to 10 percent, while sales in Central Europe
and the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to see moderate gains
from the depressed level in 2010. Industry sales in Asia also are forecast to
grow moderately.

In South America, industry
sales are projected to be about the same in 2011 relative to the strong levels
of 2010, although the company’s sales in the region are expected to benefit
from a broader lineup of recently introduced products.

Industry sales of turf and
utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be approximately the
same after experiencing some recovery in 2010.

Construction
and Forestry.

Worldwide sales of the company’s construction and
forestry equipment are forecast to rise by 25 to 30 percent for fiscal year
2011. The increase reflects market conditions that are somewhat improved in
relation to the relatively low level in 2010. In addition, sales to independent
rental companies are expected to see further growth. World forestry markets are
expected to move significantly higher as a result of improved wood and pulp
prices.

Credit.

Net income in
fiscal year 2011 for the company’s credit operations is forecast to be
approximately $360 million. The forecast increase from 2010 primarily is due to
growth in the portfolio.

SAFE HARBOR
STATEMENT

Safe
Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:

Statements
under “Overview,” “Market Conditions and Outlook” and other forward-looking
statements herein that relate to future events, expectations and operating
periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of
these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while
others could affect all of the company’s businesses.

The company’s agricultural
equipment business is subject to a number of uncertainties including the many
interrelated factors that affect farmers’ confidence. These factors include
worldwide economic conditions, demand for agricultural products, world grain
stocks, weather conditions (including its effects on timely planting and
harvesting), soil conditions, harvest yields, prices for commodities and
livestock, crop and livestock production expenses, availability of transport
for crops, the growth of non-food uses for some crops (including ethanol and
biodiesel production), real estate values, available acreage for farming, the
land ownership policies of various governments, changes in government farm
programs and policies (including those in the U.S., Russia and Brazil),
international reaction to such programs, global trade agreements, animal
diseases and their effects on poultry and beef consumption and prices, crop
pests and diseases, and the level of farm product exports (including concerns
about genetically modified organisms).

Factors affecting the
outlook for the company’s turf and utility equipment include general economic
conditions, consumer confidence, weather conditions, customer profitability,
consumer borrowing patterns, consumer purchasing preferences, housing starts,
infrastructure investment, spending by municipalities and golf courses, and
consumable input costs.

General economic conditions,
consumer spending patterns, real estate and housing prices, the number of
housing starts and interest rates are especially important to sales of the
company’s construction and forestry equipment. The levels of public and
non-residential construction also impact the results of the company’s
construction and forestry segment. Prices for pulp, paper, lumber and
structural panels are important to sales of forestry equipment.


All of the company’s
businesses and its reported results are affected by general economic conditions
in the global markets in which the company operates, especially material
changes in economic activity in these markets; customer confidence in general
economic conditions; foreign currency exchange rates, especially fluctuations
in the value of the U.S. dollar; interest rates; and inflation and deflation
rates. General economic conditions can affect demand for the company’s
equipment as well. The current economic conditions and outlook in certain
sectors have dampened demand for certain equipment.

Customer and company
operations and results could be affected by changes in weather patterns; the
political and social stability of the global markets in which the company
operates; the effects of, or response to, terrorism and security threats
(including those in Mexico); wars and other conflicts and the threat thereof;
and the spread of major epidemics (including H1N1 and other influenzas).

Significant changes in
market liquidity conditions could impact access to funding and associated
funding costs, which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows. Market
conditions could also negatively impact customer access to capital for
purchases of the company’s products; borrowing and repayment practices; and the
number and size of customer loan delinquencies and defaults. A sovereign debt
crisis, in Europe or elsewhere, could negatively impact currencies, global
financial markets, social and political stability, funding sources and costs,
customers, and company operations and results. State debt crises also could
negatively impact customers, suppliers, demand for equipment, and company
operations and results. The company’s investment management activities could be
impaired by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively
affect earnings.

Additional factors that
could materially affect the company’s operations and results include changes in
and the impact of governmental trade, banking, monetary and fiscal policies,
including financial regulatory reform, and governmental programs in particular
jurisdictions or for the benefit of certain industries or sectors (including
protectionist policies and trade and licensing restrictions that could disrupt
international commerce); actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other
central banks; actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other financial regulators;
actions by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies, including
those related to engine emissions (in particular Interim Tier 4 and Final Tier
4 emission requirements), noise and the risk of climate change; changes in
labor regulations; changes to accounting standards; changes in tax rates and
regulations; and actions by other regulatory bodies including changes in laws
and regulations affecting the sectors in which the company operates.

Other factors that could
materially affect results include production, design and technological
innovations and difficulties, including capacity and supply constraints and
prices; the availability and prices of strategically sourced materials,
components and whole goods; delays or disruptions in the company’s supply chain
due to weather, natural disasters or financial hardship or the loss of
liquidity by suppliers; start-up of new plants and new products; the success of
new product initiatives and customer acceptance of new products; changes in
customer purchasing behavior in response to changes in equipment design to meet
government regulations and other standards; oil and energy prices and supplies;
the availability and cost of freight; actions of competitors in the various
industries in which the company competes, particularly price discounting;
dealer practices especially as to levels of new and used field inventories;
labor relations; acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, the integration
of new businesses; the implementation of organizational changes; changes in
company declared dividends and common stock issuances and repurchases.

Company results are also
affected by changes in the level of employee retirement benefits, changes in
market values of investment assets and the level of interest rates, which
impact retirement benefit costs, and significant changes in health care costs
including those which may result from governmental action.

The liquidity and ongoing
profitability of John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) and other
credit subsidiaries depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future
cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with
engaging in diversified funding activities and to fund purchases of the
company’s products. If market volatility increases and general economic
conditions worsen, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally,
customer confidence levels may result in declines in credit applications and
increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact
write-offs and provisions for credit losses.

The company’s outlook is
based upon assumptions relating to the factors described above, which are
sometimes based upon estimates and data prepared by government agencies. Such
estimates and data are often revised. The company, except as required by law,
undertakes no obligation to update or revise its outlook, whether as a result
of new developments or otherwise. Further information concerning the company
and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect
the company’s financial results, is included in other filings with the SEC.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

CONSOLIDATED
RESULTS

Worldwide net income in 2009
was $873 million, or $2.06 per share diluted ($2.07 basic), compared with
$2,053 million, or $4.70 per share diluted ($4.76 basic), in 2008. Included in
net income for 2009 were charges of $381 million pretax ($332 million
after-tax), or $.78 per share diluted and basic, related to impairment of
goodwill and voluntary employee separation expenses (see Note 5). Net sales and
revenues decreased 19 percent to $23,112 million in 2009, compared with $28,438
million in 2008. Net sales of the Equipment Operations decreased 20 percent in
2009 to $20,756 million from $25,803 million in 2008. The sales decrease was
primarily due to lower shipment volumes. The decrease also included an
unfavorable effect for currency translation of 4 percent,


more than offset by price
realization of 5 percent. Net sales in the U.S. and Canada decreased 14 percent
in 2009. Net sales outside the U.S. and Canada decreased by 28 percent in 2009,
which included an unfavorable effect of 8 percent for currency translation.

Worldwide Equipment
Operations had an operating profit of $1,365 million in 2009, compared with
$2,927 million in 2008. The deterioration in operating profit was primarily due
to lower shipment and production volumes, the unfavorable effects of foreign
currency exchange, a goodwill impairment charge, higher raw material costs and
voluntary employee separation expenses, partially offset by improved price
realization and lower selling, administrative and general expenses.

The Equipment Operations’
net income, including noncontrolling interests, was $677 million in 2009,
compared with $1,677 million in 2008. The same operating factors mentioned
above, in addition to a higher effective tax rate, affected these results.

Trade receivables and
inventories at October 31, 2009 were $5,014 million, compared with $6,276
million in 2008, or 24 percent of net sales in both years.

Net income of the company’s
Financial Services operations in 2009 decreased to $203 million, compared with
$337 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily a result of a higher provision
for credit losses, lower commissions from crop insurance, narrower financing
spreads and higher losses from construction equipment operating lease residual
values, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate primarily from wind
energy tax credits and lower selling, administrative and general expenses.
Additional information is presented in the following discussion of the
“Worldwide Credit Operations.”

The cost of sales to net
sales ratio for 2009 was 78.3 percent, compared with 75.9 percent in 2008. The
increase was primarily due to lower shipment and production volumes,
unfavorable effects of foreign exchange, a goodwill impairment charge, higher
raw material costs and voluntary employee separation expenses.

Finance and interest income
declined in 2009 due to lower financing rates and a smaller average portfolio.
Other income decreased primarily as a result of lower commissions from crop
insurance and lower earnings from marketable securities. Research and
development expenses increased primarily as a result of increased spending in
support of new products including designing and producing products with engines
to meet more stringent emissions regulations. Selling, administrative and general
expenses decreased primarily due to lower compensation expenses and the effect
of currency translation. Interest expense decreased due to lower average
borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. The equity in
income of unconsolidated affiliates decreased as a result of lower income from
construction equipment manufacturing affiliates impacted by the low levels of
construction activity.

The company has several
defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life
insurance plans. The company’s postretirement benefit costs for these plans in
2009 were $312 million, compared with $277 million in 2008. The long-term
expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an
expected gain of 8.2 percent in 2009 and 2008, or $857 million in 2009 and $920
million in 2008. The actual return was a gain of $1,142 million in 2009 and a
loss of $2,158 million in 2008. Total company contributions to the plans were
$358 million in 2009 and $431 million in 2008, which include direct benefit
payments for unfunded plans. These contributions also included voluntary
contributions to total plan assets of approximately $150 million in 2009 and
$297 million in 2008.

BUSINESS
SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS

Worldwide
Agriculture and Turf Operations

The agriculture and turf
segment had an operating profit of $1,448 million in 2009, compared with $2,461
million in 2008. Net sales decreased 14 percent in 2009 due to lower shipment
volumes and the unfavorable effects of currency translation, partially offset
by improved price realization. The decrease in operating profit was primarily
due to lower shipment and production volumes, unfavorable effects of foreign
currency exchange, a goodwill impairment charge, higher raw material costs and
voluntary employee separation expenses, partially offset by improved price
realization and lower selling, administrative and general expenses.

Worldwide
Construction and Forestry Operations

The construction and
forestry segment had an operating loss of $83 million in 2009, compared with an
operating profit of $466 million in 2008. Net sales decreased 45 percent in
2009 reflecting the pressure from market conditions. The operating profit was
lower primarily due to lower shipment and production volumes and lower equity
in income from unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by improved price
realization and lower selling, administrative and general expenses.

Worldwide
Credit Operations

The operating profit of the
credit operations was $223 million in 2009, compared with $478 million in 2008.
The decrease in operating profit was primarily due to a higher provision for
credit losses, lower commissions from crop insurance, narrower financing
spreads, a higher pretax loss from wind energy projects and higher losses from
construction equipment operating lease residual values, partially offset by
lower selling, administrative and general expenses. Total revenues of the
credit operations, including intercompany revenues, decreased 11 percent in
2009, primarily reflecting the lower financing rates and a smaller portfolio.
The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 1 percent lower in
2009, compared with 2008. Interest expense decreased 8 percent in 2009 as a
result of lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average
borrowings. The credit operations’ ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.24
to 1 in 2009, compared with 1.45 to 1 in 2008.


Equipment
Operations in U.S. and Canada

The equipment operations in
the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $1,129 million in 2009, compared
with $1,831 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipment
and production volumes, a goodwill impairment charge, higher raw material costs
and voluntary employee separation expenses, partially offset by improved price
realization and decreased selling, administrative and general expenses. Net
sales decreased 14 percent due to lower volumes and the unfavorable effects of
currency translation, partially offset by improved price realization. The
physical volume decreased 18 percent, compared with 2008.

Equipment
Operations outside U.S. and Canada

The equipment operations
outside the U.S. and Canada had an operating profit of $236 million in 2009,
compared with $1,096 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the
effects of lower shipment and production volumes, unfavorable effects of
foreign currency exchange rates and increases in raw material costs, partially
offset by improved price realization and decreased selling, administrative and
general expenses. Net sales were 28 percent lower reflecting lower volumes and
the effect of currency translation, partially offset by improvements in price
realization. The physical volume decreased 26 percent, compared with 2008.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The discussion of capital
resources and liquidity has been organized to review separately, where
appropriate, the company’s consolidated totals, Equipment Operations and
Financial Services operations.

CONSOLIDATED

Positive cash flows from
consolidated operating activities in 2010 were $2,282 million. This resulted
primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash provisions and an increase in
accounts payable and accrued expenses, which were partially offset by an
increase in trade receivables and inventories. Cash outflows from investing
activities were $2,109 million in 2010, primarily due to the cost of
receivables and equipment on operating leases exceeding the collections of
receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by
$1,376 million and purchases of property and equipment of $762 million. Cash
outflows from financing activities were $1,010 million in 2010 primarily due to
dividends paid of $484 million, repurchases of common stock of $359 million and
a decrease in borrowings of $299 million, which were partially offset by
proceeds from issuance of common stock of $129 million (resulting from the
exercise of stock options). Cash and cash equivalents decreased $861 million
during 2010.

Over the last three years,
operating activities have provided an aggregate of $6,216 million in cash. In
addition, increases in borrowings were $2,091 million, proceeds from maturities
and sales of marketable securities exceeded purchases by $1,368 million and
proceeds from issuance of common stock were $255 million. The aggregate amount
of these cash flows was used mainly to purchase property and equipment of $2,781
million, repurchase common stock of $2,040 million, acquire receivables and
equipment on operating leases that exceeded collections and the proceeds from
sales of equipment on operating leases by $2,008 million, pay dividends to
stockholders of $1,405 million and acquire businesses for $348 million. Cash
and cash equivalents also increased $1,512 million over the three-year period.

Given the continued
volatility in the global economy, there has been a reduction in liquidity in
some global markets that continues to affect the funding activities of the
company. However, the company has access to most global markets at a reasonable
cost and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to
meet its funding needs. Sources of liquidity for the company include cash and
cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds from operations, the issuance of
commercial paper and term debt, the securitization of retail notes (both public
and private markets) and committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit. The
company’s commercial paper outstanding at October 31, 2010 and 2009 was
$2,028 million and $286 million, respectively, while the total cash and cash
equivalents and marketable securities position was $4,019 million and $4,844
million, respectively.

Lines of Credit.

The company also has access
to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the
lines are available to both Deere & Company and Capital Corporation.
Worldwide lines of credit totaled $5,294 million at October 31, 2010,
$3,222 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing unused credit
lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured
borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were primarily
considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at
October 31, 2010 was a long-term credit facility agreement of $3,750
million, expiring in February 2012, and a long-term credit facility
agreement of $1,500 million, expiring in April 2013. These credit
agreements require Capital Corporation to maintain its consolidated ratio of
earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter
and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital
base (total subordinated debt and Capital Corporation stockholder’s equity
excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to
1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require the
Equipment Operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total
debt and Deere & Company stockholders’ equity excluding accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end of each
fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the company’s excess equity capacity and
retained earnings balance free of restriction at October 31, 2010 was
$7,832 million. Alternatively under this provision, the Equipment Operations
had the capacity to incur additional debt of $14,545 million at October 31,
2010. All of these requirements of the credit agreements have been met during
the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.


Debt Ratings.

To access public debt capital markets, the
company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term
credit ratings to the company’s securities as an indicator of credit quality
for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the
rating agency to buy, sell or hold company securities. A credit rating agency
may change or withdraw company ratings based on its assessment of the company’s
current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment
obligations. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any
other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs
and reduced access to debt capital markets. Credit ratings also affect the
costs of derivative transactions, including interest rate and foreign currency
derivative transactions. As a result, negative changes in the company’s credit
ratings could adversely impact the company’s cost of funding. The senior
long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured
company securities by the rating agencies engaged by the company are as
follows:

Trade accounts and notes
receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. Trade
receivables increased by $847 million in 2010, primarily due to higher
production and shipment volumes. The ratio of trade accounts and notes
receivable at October 31 to fiscal year net sales was 15 percent in 2010
and 13 percent in 2009. Total worldwide agriculture and turf receivables
increased $566 million and construction and forestry receivables increased $281
million. The collection period for trade receivables averages less than 12
months. The percentage of trade receivables outstanding for a period exceeding
12 months was 3 percent and 4 percent at October 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

Deere & Company’s
stockholders’ equity was $6,290 million at October 31, 2010, compared with
$4,819 million at October 31, 2009. The increase of $1,471 million
resulted primarily from net income attributable to Deere & Company of
$1,865 million, a change in the retirement benefits adjustment of $158 million,
an increase in common stock of $110 million and a change in the cumulative
translation adjustment of $36 million, which were partially offset by dividends
declared of $492 million and an increase in treasury stock of $225 million.

EQUIPMENT
OPERATIONS

The company’s equipment
businesses are capital intensive and are subject to seasonal variations in
financing requirements for inventories and certain receivables from dealers.
The Equipment Operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables
to Financial Services. To the extent necessary, funds provided from operations
are supplemented by external financing sources.

Cash provided by operating
activities of the Equipment Operations during 2010, including intercompany cash
flows, was $2,545 million primarily due to net income adjusted for non-cash
provisions and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially
offset by an increase in inventories and trade receivables.

Over the last three years,
these operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, have provided an
aggregate of $6,335 million in cash.

Trade receivables held by
the Equipment Operations increased by $224 million during 2010. The Equipment
Operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to Financial
Services (see previous consolidated discussion).

Inventories increased by
$666 million in 2010 primarily reflecting the increase in production and sales.
Most of these inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
The ratios of inventories on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis (see Note 15),
which approximates current cost, to fiscal year cost of sales were 26 percent
and 23 percent at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Total interest-bearing debt
of the Equipment Operations was $3,414 million at the end of 2010, compared
with $3,563 million at the end of 2009 and $2,209 million at the end of 2008.
The ratio of total debt to total capital (total interest-bearing debt and
stockholders’ equity) at the end of 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 35 percent, 43
percent and 25 percent, respectively.

Property and equipment cash
expenditures for the Equipment Operations in 2010 were $736 million, compared
with $788 million in 2009. Capital expenditures in 2011 are estimated to be
approximately $1,000 million.

FINANCIAL
SERVICES

The Financial Services’
credit operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds
to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Their primary sources of
funds for this purpose are a combination of commercial paper, term debt, securitization
of retail notes, equity capital and from time to time borrowings from Deere &
Company.

The cash provided by
operating activities, financing activities and the beginning balance of cash
and cash equivalents was used for investing activities. Cash flows from the
Financial Services’ operating activities, including intercompany cash flows,
were $1,274 million in 2010. Cash used by investing activities totaled $2,658
million in 2010, primarily due to the cost of receivables and equipment on
operating leases exceeding collections of receivables and the proceeds from
sales of equipment on operating leases by $2,709 million. Cash provided by
financing activities totaled $872 million in 2010, representing primarily an
increase in borrowings from Deere & Company of $1,230 million,
partially offset by a $164 million decrease in external borrowings. Cash and
cash equivalents decreased $520 million.

Over the last three years,
the Financial Services’ operating activities, including intercompany cash
flows, have provided $3,111 million in cash. In addition, an increase in total
borrowings of $2,159 million and capital investment from Deere &
Company of $599 million provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used
mainly to fund receivable and equipment on operating lease acquisitions, which
exceeded collections and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating
leases by $4,490 million, pay dividends to Deere & Company


of $783 million and fund
purchases of property and equipment of $484 million. Cash and cash equivalents
also increased $183 million over the three-year period.

Receivables and equipment on
operating leases increased by $2,391 million in 2010, compared with 2009.
Acquisition volumes of receivables and equipment on operating leases increased
13 percent in 2010, compared with 2009. The volumes of financing leases,
operating leases, retail notes, wholesale notes, trade receivables and
revolving charge accounts increased approximately 41 percent, 31 percent, 30
percent, 27 percent, 9 percent and 4 percent, respectively. The volume of
operating loans decreased approximately 67 percent. At October 31, 2010
and 2009, net receivables and leases administered, which include receivables
administered but not owned, were $25,029 million and $22,729 million,
respectively.

Total external
interest-bearing debt of the credit operations was $20,935 million at the end
of 2010, compared with $20,988 million at the end of 2009 and $20,210 million
at the end of 2008. Included in this debt are secured borrowings of $2,209
million at the end of 2010, $3,132 million at the end of 2009 and $1,682
million at the end of 2008. Total external borrowings have changed generally
corresponding with the level of the receivable and lease portfolio, the level
of cash and cash equivalents and the change in payables owed to Deere &
Company. The credit operations’ ratio of total interest-bearing debt to total
stockholder’s equity was 7.3 to 1 at the end of 2010, 7.4 to 1 at the end of 2009
and 8.3 to 1 at the end of 2008.

In November 2009,
Capital Corporation renewed a revolving credit agreement to utilize bank
conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 13). At October 31,
2010, this facility had a total capacity, or “financing limit,” of up to $1,500
million of secured financings at any time. After a 364-day revolving period,
unless the banks and Capital Corporation agree to renew, Capital Corporation
would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail
notes are collected. At October 31, 2010, $835 million of secured
short-term borrowings was outstanding under the agreement. In November 2010,
Capital Corporation increased the capacity under this revolving credit
agreement to $2,000 million and renewed it for an additional three years.

In April 2010, the
credit operations completed a $708 million retail note securitization
transaction, which is included in short-term secured borrowings.

During 2010, the credit
operations also issued $2,316 million and retired $3,364 million of long-term
borrowings, which were primarily medium-term notes.

Property and equipment cash
expenditures for Financial Services in 2010 were $26 million, compared with
$119 million in 2009, primarily related to investments in wind energy
generation in both years. Government grant receipts related to property and
equipment were $92 million in 2010 associated with the wind energy entities.
Capital expenditures in 2011 are not expected to be significant. The company
sold the wind energy business for approximately $900 million after year end
(see Notes 4 and 30).

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The company’s credit
operations offer crop insurance products through managing general agency
agreements (Agreements) with insurance companies (Insurance Carriers) rated
“Excellent” by A.M. Best Company. The credit operations have guaranteed
certain obligations under the Agreements, including the obligation to pay the
Insurance Carriers for any uncollected premiums. At October 31, 2010, the
maximum exposure for uncollected premiums was approximately $56 million.
Substantially all of the crop insurance risk under the Agreements have been
mitigated by a syndicate of private reinsurance companies. In the event of a
widespread catastrophic crop failure throughout the U.S. and the default of all
the reinsurance companies on their obligations, the company would be required
to reimburse the Insurance Carriers approximately $1,029 million at October 31,
2010. The company believes the likelihood of this event is substantially
remote.

At October 31, 2010,
the company had approximately $190 million of guarantees issued primarily to
banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the retail
financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any
required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the
equipment collateralizing the receivables. The maximum remaining term of the
receivables guaranteed at October 31, 2010 was approximately five years.

AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The payment schedule for the
company’s contractual obligations at October 31, 2010 in millions of
dollars is as follows:

*

Principal payments.

**

Notes payable
of $2,209 million classified as short-term on the balance sheet related to the
securitization of retail notes are included in this table based on the expected
payment schedule (see Note 18).

The previous table does not
include unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of approximately $218 million at
October 31, 2010 since the timing of future payments is not reasonably
estimable at this time (see Note 8). For additional information regarding
pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations, short-term
borrowings, long-term borrowings and lease obligations, see Notes 7, 18, 20 and
21, respectively.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of the
company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a
significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies below
are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the
company’s financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments. The company’s other accounting policies are described in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sales
Incentives

At the time a sale to a
dealer is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales
incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when the
dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on
historical data, announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and
retail sales volumes. The final cost of these programs and the amount of
accrual required for a specific sale are fully determined when the dealer sells
the equipment to the retail customer. This is due to numerous programs
available at any particular time and new programs that may be announced after
the company records the sale. Changes in the mix and types of programs affect
these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.

The sales incentive accruals
at October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $879 million, $806 million and
$737 million, respectively. The increase in 2010 was primarily due to higher
sales volumes, compared with 2009. The increase in 2009 was primarily due to
higher sales incentive accruals related to foreign operations.

The estimation of the sales
incentive accrual is impacted by many assumptions. One of the key assumptions
is the historical percent of sales incentive costs to retail sales from
dealers. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average
of approximately plus or minus .7 percent, compared to the average sales
incentive costs to retail sales percent during that period. Holding other
assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to
increase or decrease .7 percent, the sales incentive accrual at October 31,
2010 would increase or decrease by approximately $35 million.

Product
Warranties

At the time a sale to a
dealer is recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs.
The company generally determines its total warranty liability by applying
historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has
been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail
sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of
five-year claims costs and consideration of current quality developments.
Variances in claims experience and the type of warranty programs affect these
estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.

The product warranty
accruals, excluding extended warranty unamortized premiums, at October 31,
2010, 2009 and 2008 were $559 million, $513 million and $586 million,
respectively. The changes were primarily due to higher sales volumes in 2010
and lower sales volumes in 2009.

Estimates used to determine
the product warranty accruals are significantly affected by the historical
percent of warranty claims costs to sales. Over the last five fiscal years,
this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .03
percent, compared to the average warranty costs to sales percent during that
period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience
percent were to increase or decrease .03 percent, the warranty accrual at
October 31, 2010 would increase or decrease by approximately $10 million.

Postretirement
Benefit Obligations

Pension obligations and
other postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) obligations are based on various
assumptions used by the company’s actuaries in calculating these amounts. These
assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected
return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement rates, mortality
rates and other factors. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and
changes in assumptions affect future expenses and obligations.

The pension liabilities, net
of pension assets, recognized on the balance sheet at October 31, 2010 and
2009, were $693 million and $1,307 million, respectively. The pension assets,
net of pension liabilities, at 2008 were $683 million. The OPEB liabilities,
net of OPEB assets, on these same dates were $4,830 million, $4,652 million and
$2,535 million, respectively. The decrease in the pension net liabilities in
2010 was primarily due to the return on plan assets and company contributions,
partially offset by the decrease in discount rates. The increase in the OPEB
net liabilities in 2010 and 2009 and the increase in pension net liabilities in
2009 were primarily due to the decrease in the discount rates for the
liabilities.

The effect of hypothetical
changes to selected assumptions on the company’s major U.S. retirement benefit
plans would be as follows in millions of dollars:

*

Projected benefit obligation
(PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
(APBO) for OPEB plans.

**

Pretax impact on service
cost, interest cost and amortization of gains or losses.


Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized
and is tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances change
such that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
reduced below its carrying amount. The end of the third quarter is the annual
measurement date. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each
reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the
goodwill is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which
the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill.

An estimate of the fair
value of the reporting unit is determined through a combination of comparable
market values for similar businesses and discounted cash flows. These estimates
can change significantly based on such factors as the reporting unit’s
financial performance, economic conditions, interest rates, growth rates,
pricing, changes in business strategies and competition.

Based on this testing, the
company identified one reporting unit in 2010 and one reporting unit in 2009
for which the goodwill was impaired. In the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009,
the company recorded a non-cash pretax charge in cost of sales of $27 million
($25 million after-tax) and $289 million ($274 million after-tax),
respectively. The charges were related to write-downs of the goodwill
associated with reporting units included in the agriculture and turf operating
segment. The key factor contributing to the impairments was a decline in the
reporting units’ forecasted financial performance (see Note 5).

A 10 percent decrease in the
estimated fair value of the company’s other reporting units would have had no
impact on the carrying value of goodwill at the annual measurement date in
2010.

Allowance
for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit
losses represents an estimate of the losses expected from the company’s
receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many quantitative
and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience by product
category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and
credit risk quality. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly.
Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes
to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses.

The total allowance for
credit losses at October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $296 million, $316
million and $226 million, respectively. The decrease in 2010 was primarily due
to a decrease in loss experience. The increase in 2009 was primarily due to an
increase in loss experience and delinquencies in the construction and forestry
retail notes, revolving charge financing receivables and operating loans.

The assumptions used in
evaluating the company’s exposure to credit losses involve estimates and
significant judgment. The historical loss experience on the receivable
portfolio represents one of the key assumptions involved in determining the
allowance for credit losses. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has
varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .15 percent, compared to
the average loss experience percent during that period. Holding other
assumptions constant, if this estimated loss experience on the receivable
portfolio were to increase or decrease .15 percent, the allowance for credit
losses at October 31, 2010 would increase or decrease by approximately $35
million.

Operating
Lease Residual Values

The carrying value of
equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the
equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the
lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third
party, in which case the company may record a gain or a loss for the difference
between the estimated residual value and the sales price. The residual values
are dependent on current economic conditions and are reviewed quarterly.
Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation
expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases.

The total operating lease
residual values at October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $1,276 million,
$1,128 million and $1,055 million, respectively. The changes in 2010 and 2009
were primarily due to the levels of operating leases.

Estimates used in
determining end of lease market values for equipment on operating leases
significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. If future
market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from the company’s
present estimates, the total impact would be to increase the company’s annual
depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately $45 million.


FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK INFORMATION

The company is naturally
exposed to various interest rate and foreign currency risks. As a result, the
company enters into derivative transactions to manage certain of these
exposures that arise in the normal course of business and not for the purpose
of creating speculative positions or trading. The company’s credit operations
manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to
their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to
interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable
financing opportunities. Accordingly, from time to time, these operations enter
into interest rate swap agreements to manage their interest rate exposure. The
company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic
operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than
the local currencies. The company has entered into agreements related to the
management of these foreign currency transaction risks. The credit risk under
these interest rate and foreign currency agreements is not considered to be
significant.

Interest
Rate Risk

Quarterly, the company uses
a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of its financial
instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest rates.
The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows. Cash
flows for financing receivables are discounted at the current prevailing rate
for each receivable portfolio. Cash flows for marketable securities are
primarily discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit
spreads. Cash flows for unsecured borrowings are discounted at the applicable
benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads for similarly rated borrowers.
Cash flows for securitized borrowings are discounted at the swap yield curve
plus a market credit spread for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for
interest rate swaps are projected and discounted using forward rates from the
swap yield curve at the repricing dates. The net loss in these financial
instruments’ fair values which would be caused by decreasing the interest rates
by 10 percent from the market rates at October 31, 2010 would have been
approximately $3 million. The net loss from decreasing the interest rates by 10
percent at October 31, 2009 would have been approximately $71 million.

Foreign
Currency Risk

In the Equipment Operations,
the company’s practice is to hedge significant currency exposures. Worldwide
foreign currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the Equipment
Operations’ anticipated and committed foreign currency cash inflows, outflows
and hedging policy for the next twelve months, the company estimates that a
hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other
currencies through 2011 would decrease the 2011 expected net cash inflows by
$15 million. At last year end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S.
dollar under similar assumptions and calculations indicated a potential $20
million adverse effect on the 2010 net cash inflows.

In the Financial Services
operations, the company’s policy is to hedge the foreign currency risk if the
currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable portfolio.
As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the value of the U.S.
dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a material
effect on the Financial Services cash flows.

The
notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this
statement.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION

Structure
of Operations

Certain information in the
notes and related commentary are presented in a format which includes data
grouped as follows:

Equipment Operations

– Includes the company’s
agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations with
Financial Services reflected on the equity basis.

Financial Services

– Includes the company’s
credit and certain miscellaneous service operations.

Consolidated

– Represents the consolidation of the
Equipment Operations and Financial Services. References to “Deere &
Company” or “the company” refer to the entire enterprise.

Principles
of Consolidation

The consolidated financial
statements represent primarily the consolidation of all companies in which
Deere & Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest
entities (VIEs) are consolidated since the company is the primary beneficiary.
Deere & Company records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated
company (generally 20 to 50 percent ownership) at its related equity in the net
assets of such affiliate (see Note 10). Other investments (less than 20 percent
ownership) are recorded at cost.

Variable
Interest Entities

The company is the primary
beneficiary of and consolidates a supplier that is a VIE. The company would
absorb more than a majority of the VIE’s expected losses based on a cost
sharing supply contract. No additional support beyond what was previously
contractually required has been provided during any periods presented. The VIE
produces blended fertilizer and other lawn care products for the agriculture
and turf segment.

The assets and liabilities
of this supplier VIE consisted of the following at October 31 in millions
of dollars:

The VIE is financed through
its own accounts payable and short-term borrowings. The assets of the VIE can
only be used to settle the obligations of the VIE. The creditors of the VIE do
not have recourse to the general credit of the company.

The company also is the
primary beneficiary of and consolidates certain wind energy entities that are
VIEs, which invest in wind farms that own and operate turbines to generate
electrical energy. The assets of these VIEs were classified as held for sale at
October 31, 2010 (see Notes 4 and 30). Although the company owns less than
a majority of the equity voting rights, it owns most of the financial rights
that would absorb the VIEs’ expected losses or returns. No additional support
to the VIEs beyond what was previously contractually required has been provided
during any periods presented.

The assets and liabilities
of these wind energy VIEs consisted of the following at October 31 in
millions of dollars:

* Includes $129 million
property and equipment and $4 million other assets.

The VIEs are financed
primarily through intercompany borrowings and equity. The VIEs’ assets are
pledged as security interests for the intercompany borrowings. The remaining
creditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the
company.

See Note 13 for VIEs related
to securitization of financing receivables.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following are
significant accounting policies in addition to those included in other notes to
the consolidated financial statements.

Use of
Estimates in Financial Statements

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

Sales of equipment and
service parts are recorded when the sales price is determinable and the risks
and rewards of ownership are transferred to independent parties based on the
sales agreements in effect. In the U.S. and most international locations, this
transfer occurs primarily when goods are shipped. In Canada and some other
international locations, certain goods are shipped to dealers on a consignment
basis under which the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the
dealer. Accordingly, in these locations, sales are not recorded until a retail
customer has purchased the goods. In all cases, when a sale is recorded by the
company, no significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchaser’s
obligation to pay. No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Service
parts returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized. The
company makes appropriate provisions based on experience for costs such as
doubtful receivables, sales incentives and product warranty.

Financing revenue is
recorded over the lives of related receivables using the interest method.
Deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are recognized as a
reduction in finance revenue over the expected lives of the receivables using
the interest method. Income and deferred costs on the origination of operating
leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms
in finance revenue.


Sales
Incentives

At the time a sale is
recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs
for allowances and financing programs that will be due when a dealer sells the
equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on historical data,
announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and retail sales volumes.

Product
Warranties

At the time a sale is
recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs. These
costs are usually estimated based on historical warranty claims (see Note 22).

Sales Taxes

The company collects and
remits taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both
imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the
company and its customers. These taxes may include sales, use, value-added and
some excise taxes. The company reports the collection of these taxes on a net
basis (excluded from revenues).

Securitization
of Receivables

Certain financing
receivables are periodically transferred to special purpose entities (SPEs) in
securitization transactions (see Note 13). These securitizations qualify as
collateral for secured borrowings and no gains or losses are recognized at the
time of securitization. The receivables remain on the balance sheet and are
classified as “Restricted financing receivables - net.” The company recognizes
finance income over the lives of these receivables using the interest method.

Shipping
and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs
related to the sales of the company’s equipment are included in cost of sales.

Advertising
Costs

Advertising costs are
charged to expense as incurred. This expense was $154 million in 2010, $175
million in 2009 and $188 million in 2008.

Depreciation
and Amortization

Property and equipment,
capitalized software and other intangible assets are depreciated over their
estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. Equipment on
operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the
straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised
products, increased capacity and the replacement or major renewal of
significant items are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and
minor renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred.

Receivables
and Allowances

All financing and trade
receivables are reported on the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted
for any charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts, and
any deferred fees or costs on originated financing receivables. Allowances for
credit losses and doubtful accounts are maintained in amounts considered to be
appropriate in relation to the receivables outstanding based on collection
experience, economic conditions and credit risk quality.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The company evaluates the
carrying value of long-lived assets (including property and equipment, goodwill
and other intangible assets) when events or circumstances warrant such a
review. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for
impairment annually at the end of the third fiscal quarter each year, or more
often if events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below
the carrying value. Goodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by
reporting units, which consist primarily of the operating segments and certain
other reporting units. The goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which
the business that created the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill
impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair
value. If the carrying value of the goodwill or long-lived asset is considered
impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the fair value of the asset (see Note 5).

Derivative
Financial Instruments

It is the company’s policy
that derivative transactions are executed only to manage exposures arising in
the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative
positions or trading. The company’s credit operations manage the relationship
of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease
portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign
currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities.
The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and
domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies
other than the local currencies.

All derivatives are recorded
at fair value on the balance sheet. Cash collateral received or paid is not
offset against the derivative fair values on the balance sheet. Each derivative
is designated as either a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or remains
undesignated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
effective as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and
reclassified to the income statement when the effects of the item being hedged
are recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are designated and effective as fair value hedges are
recognized currently in net income. These changes are offset in net income to
the extent the hedge was effective by fair value changes related to the risk
being hedged on the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of undesignated
hedges are recognized currently in the income statement. All ineffective
changes in derivative fair values are recognized currently in net income.

All designated hedges are
formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as the
risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis the hedging
instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness, when applicable. If and when a
derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, or the
underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the hedge
designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, the hedge accounting
discussed above is discontinued (see Note 27).


Foreign
Currency Translation

The functional currencies
for most of the company’s foreign operations are their respective local
currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into
U.S. dollars at the end of the period exchange rates. The revenues and expenses
are translated at weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or losses
from these translations are recorded in other comprehensive income. Gains or
losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency of the subsidiary involved and foreign exchange forward contracts are
included in net income. The pretax net losses for foreign exchange in 2010,
2009 and 2008 were $75 million, $68 million and $13 million, respectively.

3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

New
Accounting Standards Adopted

In the first quarter of
2010, the company adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 810, Consolidation (FASB Statement No. 160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements). ASC 810
requires that noncontrolling interests are reported as a separate line in
stockholders’ equity. The net income for both Deere & Company and the
noncontrolling interests is included in “Net Income.” The “Net income (loss)
attributable to noncontrolling interests” is deducted from “Net Income” to
determine the “Net Income Attributable to Deere & Company,” which will
continue to be used to determine earnings per share. ASC 810 also requires
certain prospective changes in accounting for noncontrolling interests
primarily related to increases and decreases in ownership and changes in
control. As required, the presentation and disclosure requirements were adopted
through retrospective application, and the consolidated financial statement
prior period information has been adjusted accordingly. The adoption did not have
a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In the first quarter of
2010, the company adopted FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (FASB Statement No. 141
(revised 2007), Business Combinations). ASC 805 requires an acquirer to measure
the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition
date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets
acquired. This standard also requires the fair value measurement of certain
other assets and liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies
and research and development. The adoption did not have a material effect on
the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In the first quarter of
2010, the company adopted FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements), for nonrecurring
measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The standard requires that
these measurements comply with certain guidance for fair value measurements and
the disclosure of such measurements. The adoption did not have a material
effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In the first quarter of
2010, the company adopted FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share (FASB Staff Position
(FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments
Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities).
Based on this guidance, the company’s nonvested restricted stock awards are
considered participating securities since they contain nonforfeitable dividend
equivalent rights. The diluted earnings per share are reported as the most
dilutive of either the two-class method or the treasury stock method. This requires
the company to compute earnings per share on the two-class method. The adoption
did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
statements (see Note 23).

In the first quarter of
2010, the company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-09,
Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements, which amends ASC
855, Subsequent Events. This ASU removes the requirement for an SEC filer to
disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. This
change removes potential conflicts with SEC requirements. The adoption did not
have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In the second quarter of
2010, the company adopted ASU No. 2010-06, Improving Disclosures
about Fair Value Measurements, which amends ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures. This ASU requires disclosures of transfers into and out of
Levels 1 and 2, more detailed roll forward reconciliations of Level 3 recurring
fair value measurements on a gross basis, fair value information by class of
assets and liabilities, and descriptions of valuation techniques and inputs for
Level 2 and 3 measurements. The effective date for the roll forward
reconciliations is the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. The adoption in the
second quarter this year did not have a material effect and the future adoption
will not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial
statements.

At the end of the fourth
quarter of 2010, the company adopted FASB ASC 715, Compensation-Retirement
Benefits (FSP Financial Accounting Statement (FAS) 132(R)-1, Employers’
Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets). ASC 715 requires
additional disclosures relating to how investment allocation decisions are
made, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques
used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the levels within the fair value
hierarchy in which the measurements fall, a reconciliation of the beginning and
ending balances for Level 3 measurements, the effect of fair value measurements
using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period
and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. The adoption did not
have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.


New
Accounting Standards to be Adopted

In December 2009, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2009-16, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets,
which amends ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing (FASB Statement No. 166,
Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140).
This ASU eliminates the qualifying special purpose entities from the
consolidation guidance and clarifies the requirements for isolation and
limitations on portions of financial assets that are eligible for sale
accounting. It requires additional disclosures about the risks from continuing
involvement in transferred financial assets accounted for as sales. The
effective date is the beginning of fiscal year 2011. The adoption will not have
a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2009, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2009-17, Improvements to Financial Reporting by
Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, which amends ASC 810,
Consolidation (FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)).
This ASU requires a qualitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary
of a VIE. The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary as the enterprise
that has both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to
absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the
VIE. The ASU also requires additional disclosures about an enterprise’s
involvement in a VIE. The effective date is the beginning of fiscal year 2011.
The adoption will not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In July 2010, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2010-20, Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing
Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses, which amends ASC 310,
Receivables. This ASU requires disclosures related to financing receivables and
the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment. The ASU also requires
disclosures of information regarding the credit quality, aging, nonaccrual
status and impairments by class of receivable. A portfolio segment is the level
at which a creditor develops a systematic methodology for determining its
credit allowance. A receivable class is a subdivision of a portfolio segment
with similar measurement attributes, risk characteristics and common methods to
monitor and assess credit risk. Trade accounts receivable with maturities of
one year or less are excluded from the disclosure requirements. The effective
date for disclosures as of the end of the reporting period is the first quarter
of fiscal year 2011. The effective date for disclosures for activity during the
reporting period is the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. The adoption will
not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

4. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

In August 2010, the
company announced it had signed an agreement to sell John Deere Renewables, LLC,
its wind energy business. The company concluded that its resources are best
invested in growing its core businesses. These assets were reclassified as held
for sale and written down to fair value less cost to sell at October 31,
2010 (see Note 26). The asset write-down in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $35
million pretax and included in “Other operating expenses.” The assets
classified as held for sale after the write-down consisted of $908 million of
wind energy investments previously included in property and equipment and $23
million of other miscellaneous assets. At October 31, 2010, the related
liabilities to be sold recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses
totaled $35 million and the noncontrolling interest was $2 million. The company
closed the sale for approximately $900 million after year end (see Note 30).

5. SPECIAL ITEMS

Restructuring

In September 2008, the
company announced it would close its manufacturing facility in Welland,
Ontario, Canada, and transfer production to company operations in Horicon,
Wisconsin, U.S., and Monterrey and Saltillo, Mexico. The Welland factory
manufactured utility vehicles and attachments for the agriculture and turf
business. The factory discontinued manufacturing in the fourth quarter of 2009.
The move supported ongoing efforts aimed at improved efficiency and
profitability.

The closure resulted in
total expenses recognized in cost of sales in millions of dollars as follows:

All expenses are included in
the agriculture and turf operating segment. The pretax cash expenditures
associated with this closure through 2010 were approximately $60 million. The
annual pretax increase in earnings and cash flows due to this restructuring was
approximately $40 million in 2010. Property and equipment impairment values
were based primarily on market appraisals.

The remaining liability for
employee termination benefits at October 31, 2010 was $4 million, which
included accrued benefit expenses to date of $25 million and an increase due to
foreign currency translation of $3 million, which were partially offset by $24
million of benefits paid to date.

Voluntary
Employee Separations

The company combined the
agricultural equipment segment and the commercial and consumer equipment
segment into the agriculture and turf segment effective at the beginning of the
third quarter of 2009. Voluntary employee separations related to the new
organizational structure resulted in pretax expenses of $91 million in 2009.
The expenses were approximately 60 percent cost of sales and 40 percent
selling, administrative and general expenses.


Goodwill
Impairment

In the fourth quarter of
2010, the company recorded a non-cash charge in cost of sales for the
impairment of goodwill of $27 million pretax, or $25 million after-tax. The
charge was associated with the company’s John Deere Water reporting unit, which
is included in the agriculture and turf operating segment. The goodwill
impairment was due to a decline in the forecasted financial performance as a
result of the global economic downturn and more complex integration activities.

In the fourth quarter of
2009, the company recorded a non-cash charge in cost of sales for the
impairment of goodwill of $289 million pretax, or $274 million after-tax. The
charge was associated with the company’s John Deere Landscapes reporting unit,
which is included in the agriculture and turf operating segment. The key factor
contributing to the goodwill impairment was a decline in the reporting unit’s forecasted
financial performance as a result of weak economic conditions.

The methods for determining
the fair value of the reporting units to measure the fair value of the goodwill
included a combination of discounted cash flows and comparable market values
for similar businesses (see Note 26).

6. CASH FLOW INFORMATION

For purposes of the
statement of consolidated cash flows, the company considers investments with
purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Substantially all of the company’s short-term borrowings, excluding the current
maturities of long-term borrowings, mature or may require payment within three
months or less.

The Equipment Operations
sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to Financial Services. These
intercompany cash flows are eliminated in the consolidated cash flows.

All cash flows from the
changes in trade accounts and notes receivable (see Note 12) are classified as
operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows as these receivables
arise from sales to the company’s customers. Cash flows from financing
receivables that are related to sales to the company’s customers (see Note 12)
are also included in operating activities. The remaining financing receivables
are related to the financing of equipment sold by independent dealers and are
included in investing activities.

The company had the
following non-cash operating and investing activities that were not included in
the statement of consolidated cash flows. The company transferred inventory to
equipment on operating leases of $405 million, $320 million and $307 million in
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The company also had accounts payable
related to purchases of property and equipment of $135 million, $81 million and
$158 million at October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Cash payments (receipts) for
interest and income taxes consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The company has several
defined benefit pension plans covering its U.S. employees and employees in
certain foreign countries. The company has several postretirement health care
and life insurance plans for retired employees in the U.S. and Canada. The
company uses an October 31 measurement date for these plans.

The components of net
periodic pension cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the
following in millions of dollars and in percents:

The components of net
periodic postretirement benefits cost and the assumptions related to the cost
consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents:


The
above benefit plan costs in net income and other changes in plan assets and
benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in millions of dollars were
as follows:

The
benefit plan obligations, funded status and the assumptions related to the
obligations at October 31 in millions of dollars follow:

The amounts recognized at
October 31 in millions of dollars consist of the following:

The total accumulated
benefit obligations for all pension plans at October 31, 2010 and 2009 was
$9,734 million and $9,294 million, respectively.

The accumulated benefit
obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated
benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $1,039 million and $583
million, respectively, at October 31, 2010 and $5,567 million and $4,574
million, respectively, at October 31, 2009. The projected benefit
obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with projected
benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $6,407 million and $5,567
million, respectively, at October 31, 2010 and $5,976 million and $4,575
million, respectively, at October 31, 2009.


The amounts in accumulated
other comprehensive income that are expected to be amortized as net expense
(income) during fiscal 2011 in millions of dollars follow:

The company expects to
contribute approximately $283 million to its pension plans and approximately
$33 million to its health care and life insurance plans in 2011, which include
direct benefit payments on unfunded plans.

The benefits expected to be
paid from the benefit plans, which reflect expected future years of service,
and the Medicare subsidy expected to be received are as follows in millions of
dollars:

*

Medicare Part D
subsidy.

The annual rates of increase
in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (the health care cost
trend rates) used to determine accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
were based on the trends for medical and prescription drug claims for pre- and
post-65 age groups due to the effects of Medicare. At October 31, 2010,
the weighted-average composite trend rates for these obligations were assumed
to be a 7.7 percent increase from 2010 to 2011, gradually decreasing to 5.0
percent from 2016 to 2017 and all future years. The obligations at October 31,
2009 and the cost in 2010 assumed an 8.2 percent increase from 2009 to 2010,
gradually decreasing to 5.0 percent from 2016 to 2017 and all future years. An
increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate
would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by $901
million and the aggregate of service and interest cost component of net
periodic postretirement benefits cost for the year by $50 million. A decrease
of one percentage point would decrease the obligations by $698 million and the
cost by $42 million.

The discount rate
assumptions used to determine the postretirement obligations at October 31,
2010 and 2009 were based on hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a
series of annualized individual discount rates. These discount rates represent
the rates at which the company’s benefit obligations could effectively be
settled at the October 31 measurement dates.

Fair value measurement
levels in the following tables are defined in Note 26.

The fair values of the
pension plan assets by category at October 31, 2010 follow in millions of
dollars:

*

Includes
contracts for interest rates of $820 million, foreign currency of $52 million
and other of $28 million.

**

Includes
contracts for interest rates of $511 million, foreign currency of $72 million
and other of $5 million.

The fair values of the
health care assets by category at October 31, 2010 follow in millions of
dollars:

*

Includes
contracts for interest rates of $12 million, foreign currency of $3 million and
other of $2 million.

**

Includes
contracts for foreign currency of $4 million.


A reconciliation of Level 3
pension and health care asset fair value measurements during 2010 in millions
of dollars follows:

*
Health care Level 3 assets represent approximately 5 percent of the
reconciliation amounts.

Fair values are determined
as follows:

Cash and Short-Term Investments

– Includes accounts that are
valued based on the account value, which approximates fair value, and
securities that are valued using a market approach (matrix pricing model) in
which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or
corroborated by observable market data.

Equity Securities and Funds

– The values are determined
by closing prices in the active market in which the equity investment trades,
or the fund’s net asset value (NAV), which is based on the fair value of the
underlying securities.

Fixed Income Securities

– The securities are valued
using either a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant
inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable
market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk and
prepayment speeds, or they are valued using the closing prices in the active
market in which the fixed income investment trades. Fixed income funds are
valued using the NAV of the fund, which is based on the fair value of the
underlying securities.

Real Estate, Venture Capital and Private Equity

– The
investments, which are structured as limited partnerships, are valued using an
income approach (estimated cash flows discounted over the expected holding
period), as well as a market approach (the valuation of similar securities and
properties). These investments are valued at estimated fair value based on
their proportionate share of the limited partnership’s fair value that is
determined by the general partner. Real estate investment trusts are valued at
the closing prices in the active markets in which the investment trades.

Hedge Funds and Other Investments

– The investments are valued
using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund, which is based on the
fair value of the underlying securities.

Interest Rate, Foreign Currency, Equity and Other Derivative
Instruments

– The derivatives are valued using either an income
approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap
curves and both forward and spot exchange rates, or a market approach (closing
prices in the active market in which the derivative instrument trades).

The primary investment
objective for the pension plan assets is to maximize the growth of these assets
to meet the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of
time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with the company’s earnings
strength and risk tolerance. The primary investment objective for the health
care plan assets is to provide the company with the financial flexibility to
pay the projected obligations to beneficiaries over a long period of time. The
asset allocation policy is the most important decision in managing the assets
and it is reviewed regularly. The asset allocation policy considers the company’s
financial strength and long-term asset class risk/return expectations since the
obligations are long-term in nature. The current target allocations for pension
assets are approximately 38 percent for equity securities, 37 percent for debt
securities, 5 percent for real estate and 20 percent for other investments. The
target allocations for health care assets are approximately 50 percent for
equity securities, 33 percent for debt securities, 3 percent for real estate
and 14 percent for other investments. The allocation percentages above include
the effects of combining derivatives with other investments to manage asset
allocations and exposures to interest rates and foreign currency exchange. The
assets are well diversified and are managed by professional investment firms as
well as by investment professionals who are company employees. As a result of
the company’s diversified investment policy, there were no significant
concentrations of risk.

The expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets reflects management’s expectations of long-term
average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in
the projected benefit obligations. The expected return is based on the outlook
for inflation and for returns in multiple asset classes, while also considering
historical returns, asset allocation and investment strategy. The company’s
approach has emphasized the long-term nature of the return estimate such that
the return assumption is not changed unless there are fundamental changes in
capital markets that affect the company’s expectations for returns over an
extended period of time (i.e., 10 to 20 years). The average annual return of
the company’s U.S. pension fund was approximately 5.1 percent during the past
ten years and approximately 10.8 percent during the past 20 years. Since return
premiums over inflation and total returns for major asset classes vary widely
even over ten-year periods, recent history is not necessarily indicative of
long-term future expected returns. The company’s systematic methodology for
determining the long-term rate of return for the company’s investment
strategies supports the long-term expected return assumptions.

The company has created
certain Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association trusts (VEBAs) for the
funding of postretirement health care benefits. The future expected asset
returns for these VEBAs are lower than the expected return on the other pension
and health care plan assets due to investment in a higher proportion of
short-term liquid securities. These assets are in addition to the other
postretirement health care plan assets that have been funded under Section 401(h) of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and maintained in a separate account in the
company’s pension plan trust.


The company has defined
contribution plans related to employee investment and savings plans primarily
in the U.S. The company’s contributions and costs under these plans were $85
million in 2010, $131 million in 2009 and $126 million in 2008.

8. INCOME TAXES

The provision for income
taxes by taxing jurisdiction and by significant component consisted of the following
in millions of dollars:

Based upon location of the
company’s operations, the consolidated income before income taxes in the U.S.
in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $2,048 million, $756 million and $1,730 million,
respectively, and in foreign countries was $977 million, $583 million and
$1,395 million, respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches of Deere &
Company and are, therefore, subject to U.S. as well as foreign income tax
regulations. The pretax income by location and the preceding analysis of the
income tax provision by taxing jurisdiction are, therefore, not directly
related.

A comparison of the
statutory and effective income tax provision and reasons for related
differences in millions of dollars follow:

*
Cumulative adjustment from change in law. Effect included in state taxes was $7
million.

At October 31, 2010,
accumulated earnings in certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. totaled $1,934
million for which no provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding
taxes has been made, because it is expected that such earnings will be
reinvested overseas indefinitely. Determination of the amount of unrecognized
deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practical.

Deferred income taxes arise
because there are certain items that are treated differently for financial
accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of the deferred
income tax assets and liabilities at October 31 in millions of dollars
follows:

Deere & Company
files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes the
wholly-owned Financial Services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for
income taxes generally as if they filed separate income tax returns.

At October 31, 2010,
certain tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $141 million were available
with $124 million expiring from 2011 through 2030 and $17 million with an
unlimited expiration date.

The Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation
Act of 2010 was signed into law in the company’s second fiscal quarter of 2010.
Under the new legislation, to the extent the company’s future health care drug
expenses are reimbursed under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy
(RDS) program, the expenses will no longer be tax deductible effective November 1,
2013. Since the tax effects for the retiree health care liabilities were
reflected in the company’s financial statements, the entire impact of this tax
change relating to the future retiree drug costs was recorded in tax expense in
the


second quarter of 2010,
which was the period in which the legislation was enacted. As a result of the
legislation, the company’s tax expenses increased approximately $130 million in
2010.

A reconciliation of the
total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at October 31 in millions of
dollars follows:

The amount of unrecognized
tax benefits at October 31, 2010 that would affect the effective tax rate
if the tax benefits were recognized was $69 million. The remaining liability
was related to tax positions for which there are offsetting tax receivables, or
the uncertainty was only related to timing. The company expects that any
reasonably possible change in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the
next twelve months would not be significant.

The company files its tax
returns according to the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates,
which includes the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign
jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has completed the examination
of the company’s federal income tax returns for periods prior to 2007. The
years 2007, 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns are either currently under
examination or remain subject to examination. Various state and foreign income
tax returns, including major tax jurisdictions in Canada and Germany, also
remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.

The company’s policy is to
recognize interest related to income taxes in interest expense and interest
income, and recognize penalties in selling, administrative and general
expenses. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the total amount of expense from interest
and penalties was $3 million, $4 million and $23 million and the interest
income was $5 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively. At October 31,
2010 and 2009, the liability for accrued interest and penalties totaled $41
million and $47 million and the receivable for interest was $5 million and $4
million, respectively.

9. OTHER INCOME AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

The major components of
other income and other operating expenses consisted of the following in
millions of dollars:

10. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES

Unconsolidated affiliated
companies are companies in which Deere & Company generally owns 20
percent to 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares. Deere &
Company does not control these companies and accounts for its investments in
them on the equity basis. The investments in these companies primarily consist
of Bell Equipment Limited (32 percent ownership), Deere-Hitachi Construction
Machinery Corporation (50 percent ownership), Xuzhou XCG John Deere Machinery
Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (50 percent ownership), John Deere Tiantuo Company, Ltd.
(51 percent ownership) and A&I Products (36 percent ownership). The
unconsolidated affiliated companies primarily manufacture or market equipment.
Deere & Company’s share of the income or loss of these companies is
reported in the consolidated income statement under “Equity in income (loss) of
unconsolidated affiliates.” The investment in these companies is reported in
the consolidated balance sheet under “Investments in unconsolidated affiliates.”

Combined financial
information of the unconsolidated affiliated companies in millions of dollars
follows:

Consolidated retained
earnings at October 31, 2010 include undistributed earnings of the
unconsolidated affiliates of $88 million. Dividends from unconsolidated
affiliates were $6 million in 2010, $.4 million in 2009 and $20 million in
2008.


11. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

All marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of stockholders’
equity. Realized gains or losses from the sales of marketable securities are
based on the specific identification method.

The amortized cost and fair
value of marketable securities at October 31 in millions of dollars
follow:

*
Primarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.

The contractual maturities
of debt securities at October 31, 2010 in millions of dollars follow:

Actual maturities may differ
from contractual maturities because some securities may be called or prepaid.
Proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities were none in 2010, $759
million in 2009 and $1,137 million in 2008. Realized gains were none, $4
million and $12 million and realized losses were none, $8 million and $15
million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase (decrease) in net
unrealized gains or losses and unrealized losses that have been continuous for over
twelve months were not material in any years presented. Unrealized losses at
October 31, 2010 were primarily the result of an increase in interest
rates and were not recognized in income due to the ability and intent to hold
to maturity. Losses related to impairment write-downs were none in 2010, $2
million in 2009 and $27 million in 2008.

12. RECEIVABLES

Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable

Trade accounts and notes
receivable at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of
dollars:

At October 31, 2010 and
2009, dealer notes included in the previous table were $852 million and $538
million, and the allowance for doubtful trade receivables was $71 million and $77
million, respectively.

The Equipment Operations
sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to Financial Services and
provide compensation to these operations at market rates of interest.

Trade accounts and notes
receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. Under
the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is charged to dealers on
outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail
customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods
granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by the
company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after the equipment is shipped and are
responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The
interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and
the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for
most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may
not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. The
company evaluates and assesses dealers on an ongoing basis as to their
creditworthiness and generally retains a security interest in the goods
associated with the trade receivables. The company is obligated to repurchase
goods sold to a dealer upon cancellation or termination of the dealer’s
contract for such causes as change in ownership and closeout of the business.

Trade accounts and notes
receivable have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture
and turf sector and construction and forestry sector as shown in the previous table.
On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit
risk in any area.


Financing
Receivables

Financing receivables at October 31
consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

The residual values for
investments in financing leases at October 31, 2010 and 2009 totaled $64
million and $59 million, respectively.

Financing receivables have
significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf sector
and construction and forestry sector as shown in the previous table. On a
geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk
in any area. The company retains as collateral a security interest in the
equipment associated with retail notes, wholesale notes and financing leases.

Financing receivables at October 31
related to the company’s sales of equipment that were included in the table
above consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

*

These retail
notes generally arise from sales of equipment by company-owned dealers or
through direct sales.

Financing receivable
installments, including unearned finance income, at October 31 are
scheduled as follows in millions of dollars:

The maximum terms for retail
notes are generally seven years for agriculture and turf equipment and five
years for construction and forestry equipment. The maximum term for financing
leases is generally five years, while the average term for wholesale notes is
less than twelve months.

At October 31, 2010 and
2009, the unpaid balances of receivables administered but not owned were $202
million and $292 million, respectively. At October 31, 2010 and 2009,
worldwide financing receivables administered, which include financing
receivables administered but not owned, totaled $20,123 million and $18,656
million, respectively.

Generally when financing
receivables are approximately 120 days delinquent, accrual of finance income
has been suspended and the estimated uncollectible amount has been written off
to the allowance for credit losses. Accrual of finance income is resumed when
the receivable becomes contractually current and collection doubts are removed.
Investments in financing receivables on non-accrual status at October 31,
2010 and 2009 were $225 million and $284 million, respectively.

Total financing receivable
amounts 60 days or more past due were $38 million at October 31, 2010,
compared with $67 million at October 31, 2009. These past-due amounts
represented .19 percent and .36 percent of the receivables financed at October 31,
2010 and 2009, respectively. The allowance for doubtful financing receivables
represented 1.12 percent and 1.28 percent of financing receivables outstanding
at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, at October 31,
2010 and 2009, the company’s credit operations had $182 million and $181
million, respectively, of deposits withheld from dealers and merchants
available for potential credit losses.


An analysis of the allowance
for doubtful financing receivables follows in millions of dollars:

Financing receivables are
considered impaired when it is probable the company will be unable to collect
all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the receivables.

An analysis of impaired
financing receivables at October 31 follows in millions of dollars:

consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

13. SECURITIZATION OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES

The company, as a part of
its overall funding strategy, periodically transfers certain financing
receivables (retail notes) into variable interest entities (VIEs) that are
special purpose entities (SPEs) as part of its asset-backed securities programs
(securitizations). The structure of these transactions is such that the
transfer of the retail notes did not meet the criteria of sales of receivables,
and is, therefore, accounted for as a secured borrowing. SPEs utilized in
securitizations of retail notes differ from other entities included in the
company’s consolidated statements because the assets they hold are legally
isolated. For bankruptcy analysis purposes, the company has sold the
receivables to the SPEs in a true sale and the SPEs are separate legal
entities. Use of the assets held by the SPEs is restricted by terms of the
documents governing the securitization transactions.

In securitizations of retail
notes related to secured borrowings, the retail notes are transferred to
certain SPEs which in turn issue debt to investors. The resulting secured borrowings
are included in short-term borrowings on the balance sheet. The securitized
retail notes are recorded as “Restricted financing receivables - net” on the
balance sheet. The total restricted assets on the balance sheet related to
these securitizations include the restricted financing receivables less an
allowance for credit losses, and other assets primarily representing restricted
cash. The SPEs supporting the secured borrowings to which the retail notes are
transferred are consolidated unless the company is not the primary beneficiary.
No additional support to these SPEs beyond what was previously contractually
required has been provided during the reporting periods.

In certain securitizations,
the company is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs and, as such, consolidates
the entities. The restricted assets (retail notes, allowance for credit losses
and other assets) of the consolidated SPEs totaled $1,739 million and $2,157
million at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The liabilities
(short-term borrowings and accrued interest) of these SPEs totaled $1,654
million and $2,133 million at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
credit holders of these SPEs do not have legal recourse to the company’s
general credit.

In other securitizations,
the company transfers retail notes into bank-sponsored, multi-seller,
commercial paper conduits, which are SPEs that are not consolidated. The
company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these conduits,
because the company’s variable interests in the conduits will not absorb a
majority of the conduits’ expected losses, residual returns, or both. This is
primarily due to these interests representing significantly less than a
majority of the conduits’ total assets and liabilities. These conduits provide
a funding source to the company (as well as other transferors into the conduit)
as they fund the retail notes through the issuance of commercial paper. The
company’s carrying values and variable interest related to these conduits were
restricted assets (retail notes, allowance for credit losses and other assets)
of $589 million and $1,059 million at October 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The liabilities (short-term borrowings and accrued interest)
related to these conduits were $557 million and $1,004 million at October 31,
2010 and 2009, respectively.

The company’s carrying
amount of the liabilities to the unconsolidated conduits, compared to the
maximum exposure to loss related to these conduits, which would only be incurred
in the event of a complete loss on the restricted assets, was as follows at October 31
in millions of dollars:

The assets of unconsolidated
conduits related to securitizations in which the company’s variable interests
were considered significant were approximately $17 billion at October 31,
2010.


The components of
consolidated restricted assets related to secured borrowings in securitization
transactions at October 31 were as follows in millions of dollars:

The components of
consolidated secured borrowings and other liabilities related to
securitizations at October 31 were as follows in millions of dollars:

The secured borrowings
related to these restricted securitized retail notes are obligations that are
payable as the retail notes are liquidated. Repayment of the secured borrowings
depends primarily on cash flows generated by the restricted assets. Due to the
company’s short-term credit rating, cash collections from these restricted
assets are not required to be placed into a segregated collection account until
immediately prior to the time payment is required to the secured creditors. At October 31,
2010, the maximum remaining term of all restricted receivables was
approximately six years.

14. EQUIPMENT ON OPERATING LEASES

Operating leases arise
primarily from the leasing of John Deere equipment to retail customers. Initial
lease terms generally range from four to 60 months. Net equipment on operating
leases totaled $1,936 million and $1,733 million at October 31, 2010 and
2009, respectively. The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over
the terms of the lease. The accumulated depreciation on this equipment was $462
million and $484 million at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
corresponding depreciation expense was $288 million in 2010, $288 million in
2009 and $308 million in 2008.

Future payments to be
received on operating leases totaled $884 million at October 31, 2010 and
are scheduled as follows in millions of dollars: 2011 – $375, 2012 – $244, 2013
– $156, 2014 – $90 and 2015 – $19.

15. INVENTORIES

Most inventories owned by
Deere & Company and its U.S. equipment subsidiaries are valued at
cost, on the “last-in, first-out” (LIFO) basis. Remaining inventories are
generally valued at the lower of cost, on the “first-in, first-out” (FIFO)
basis, or market. The value of gross inventories on the LIFO basis represented
59 percent of worldwide gross inventories at FIFO value on October 31,
2010 and 2009. The pretax favorable income effect from the liquidation of LIFO
inventory during 2009 was approximately $37 million. If all inventories had
been valued on a FIFO basis, estimated inventories by major classification at October 31
in millions of dollars would have been as follows:

16. PROPERTY AND DEPRECIATION

A summary of property and
equipment at October 31 in millions of dollars follows:

*

Weighted-averages

**

Classified as
held for sale at October 31, 2010 (see below).

In the fourth quarter of
2010, the company signed an agreement to sell its wind energy business and
reclassified the related net property and equipment of $908 million to assets
held for sale. The property and equipment included in Financial Services that
was reclassified consisted of costs of machinery and equipment of $1,058
million, construction in progress of $5 million and all other of $1 million,
less accumulated depreciation of $156 million (see Note 4).

Property and equipment is
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Total property and equipment
additions in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $802 million, $798 million and $1,147 million
and depreciation was $540 million, $513 million and $467 million, respectively.
Capitalized interest was $6 million, $15 million and $26 million in the same
periods, respectively. The cost of leased property and equipment under capital
leases amounting to $43 million and $47 million at October 31, 2010 and
2009, respectively, is included in property and equipment.


Financial Services property
and equipment additions included above were none, $1 million and $359 million
in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and depreciation was $64 million, $62 million and $34
million, respectively. Financial Services had additions to cost of property and
equipment in 2010 and 2009 of $23 million and $71 million, which were offset by
cost reductions of $23 million and $70 million due to becoming eligible for
government grants for certain wind energy investments related to costs
recognized in prior and current periods.

Capitalized software is
stated at cost less accumulated amortization, and the estimated useful life is
three years. The amounts of total capitalized software costs, including
purchased and internally developed software, classified as “Other Assets” at October 31,
2010 and 2009 were $526 million and $486 million, less accumulated amortization
of $394 million and $342 million, respectively. Amortization of these software
costs was $68 million in 2010, $54 million in 2009 and $35 million in 2008. The
cost of leased software assets under capital leases amounting to $35 million
and $33 million at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is included in
other assets.

The cost of compliance with
foreseeable environmental requirements has been accrued and did not have a
material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

17. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS-NET

The changes in amounts of
goodwill by operating segments were as follows in millions of dollars:

*
See Note 5.

The components of other
intangible assets are as follows in millions of dollars:

*   Weighted-averages

** Accumulated
amortization at 2010 and 2009 for customer lists and relationships was $44
million and $35 million and technology, patents, trademarks and other was $26
million and $27 million, respectively.

Other intangible assets are
stated at cost less accumulated amortization. The amortization of other
intangible assets in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $18 million, $18 million and $20
million, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the next five
years is as follows in millions of dollars: 2011 - $15, 2012 - $14, 2013 - $13,
2014 - $12 and 2015 - $11.

18. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Short-term borrowings at October 31
consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

The notes payable related to
securitizations for Financial Services are secured by restricted financing
receivables (retail notes) on the balance sheet (see Note 13). Although these
notes payable are classified as short-term since payment is required if the
retail notes are liquidated early, the payment schedule for these borrowings of
$2,209 million at October 31, 2010 based on the expected liquidation of
the retail notes in millions of dollars is as follows: 2011 - $1,324, 2012 -
$659, 2013 - $207 and 2014 - $19.

The weighted-average
interest rates on total short-term borrowings, excluding current maturities of
long-term borrowings, at October 31, 2010 and 2009 were 1.0 percent and
1.7 percent, respectively. The Financial Services’ short-term borrowings
represent obligations of the credit subsidiaries.


Lines of credit available
from U.S. and foreign banks were $5,294 million at October 31, 2010. Some
of these credit lines are available to both Deere & Company and
Capital Corporation. At October 31, 2010, $3,222 million of these
worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused
credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding
secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were
primarily considered to constitute utilization.

Included in the above lines
of credit was a long-term credit facility agreement for $3,750 million,
expiring in February 2012 and a long-term credit facility agreement of
$1,500 million, expiring in April 2013. The agreements are mutually
extendable and the annual facility fees are not significant. These credit
agreements require Capital Corporation to maintain its consolidated ratio of
earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter
and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital
base (total subordinated debt and Capital Corporation stockholder’s equity
excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to
1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require the
Equipment Operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total
debt and Deere & Company stockholders’ equity excluding accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end of each
fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the company’s excess equity capacity and
retained earnings balance free of restriction at October 31, 2010 was
$7,832 million. Alternatively under this provision, the Equipment Operations
had the capacity to incur additional debt of $14,545 million at October 31,
2010. All of these requirements of the credit agreements have been met during
the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.

Deere & Company has
an agreement with Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has agreed to
continue to own at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of
Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible
net worth at not less than $50 million. This agreement also obligates Deere &
Company to make income maintenance payments to Capital Corporation such that
its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1
for each fiscal quarter. Deere & Company’s obligations to make payments
to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital
Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other
liabilities. Further, Deere & Company’s obligations under the
agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporation’s indebtedness,
obligations or other liabilities. Deere & Company’s obligations to
make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of
any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital Corporation and
are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were
required under this agreement during the periods included in the consolidated financial
statements.

19. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES

Accounts payable and accrued
expenses at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

*

Primarily trade
receivable valuation accounts which are reclassified as accrued expenses by the
Equipment Operations as a result of their trade receivables being sold to
Financial Services.

20. LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

Long-term borrowings at October 31
consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

(continued)


*

Includes
unamortized fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.

**

All interest
rates are as of year end.

The Financial Services’
long-term borrowings represent obligations of the credit subsidiaries.

The approximate principal
amounts of the Equipment Operations’ long-term borrowings maturing in each of
the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2011 – $40, 2012 –
$216, 2013 – $187, 2014 – $742 and 2015 – $21. The approximate principal
amounts of the credit subsidiaries’ long-term borrowings maturing in each of
the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2011 – $3,192, 2012 –
$5,101, 2013 – $3,445, 2014 – $1,228 and 2015 – $1,039.

21. LEASES

At October 31, 2010,
future minimum lease payments under capital leases amounted to $36 million as
follows: 2011 – $16, 2012 – $3, 2013 – $2, 2014 – $2, 2015 – $1 and later years
$12. Total rental expense for operating leases was $189 million in 2010, $187
million in 2009 and $165 million in 2008. At October 31, 2010, future
minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to $542 million as
follows: 2011 – $141, 2012 – $110, 2013 – $79, 2014 – $60, 2015 – $42 and
later years $110.

22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The company generally
determines its warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience
to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under
warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims
rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and current
quality developments.

The premiums for the company’s
extended warranties are primarily recognized in income in proportion to the
costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. The unamortized
extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) included in the following table
totaled $203 million and $214 million at October 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

A reconciliation of the
changes in the warranty liability and unearned premiums in millions of dollars
follows:

At October 31, 2010,
the company had approximately $190 million of guarantees issued primarily to
banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the retail
financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any
required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the
equipment collateralizing the receivables. At October 31, 2010, the
company had accrued losses of approximately $6 million under these agreements.
The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October 31,
2010 was approximately five years.

The credit operations’
subsidiary, John Deere Risk Protection, Inc., offers crop insurance
products through managing general agency agreements (Agreements) with insurance
companies (Insurance Carriers) rated “Excellent” by A.M. Best Company. As
a managing general agent, John Deere Risk Protection, Inc. will receive
commissions from the Insurance Carriers for selling crop insurance to
producers. The credit operations have guaranteed certain obligations under the
Agreements, including the obligation to pay the Insurance Carriers for any
uncollected premiums. At October 31, 2010, the maximum exposure for
uncollected premiums was approximately $56 million. Substantially all of the
credit operations’ crop insurance risk under the Agreements has been mitigated
by a syndicate of private reinsurance companies. The reinsurance companies are
rated “Excellent” or higher by A.M. Best Company. In the event of a
widespread catastrophic crop failure throughout the U.S. and the default of
these highly rated private reinsurance companies on their reinsurance
obligations, the credit operations would be required to reimburse the Insurance
Carriers for exposure under the Agreements of approximately $1,029 million at October 31,
2010. The credit operations believe that the likelihood of the occurrence of
events that give rise to the exposures under these Agreements is substantially
remote and as a result, at October 31, 2010, the credit operation’s
accrued liability under the Agreements was not material.

At October 31, 2010,
the company had commitments of approximately $261 million for the construction
and acquisition of property and equipment. At October 31, 2010, the
company also had pledged or restricted assets of $98 million, primarily as
collateral for borrowings. In addition, see Note 13 for restricted assets
associated with borrowings related to securitizations.


The company also had other
miscellaneous contingencies totaling approximately $70 million at October 31,
2010, for which it believes the probability for payment is substantially
remote. The accrued liability for these contingencies was not material at October 31,
2010.

The company is subject to
various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its
business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including
asbestos related liability), retail credit, software licensing, patent and
trademark matters. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the
outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, the
company believes these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect
on its financial statements.

23. CAPITAL STOCK

Changes in the common stock
account in millions were as follows:

The number of common shares
the company is authorized to issue is 1,200 million. The number of authorized
preferred shares, none of which has been issued, is nine million.

The Board of Directors at
its meeting in May 2008 authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of
additional common stock (65.1 million shares based on October 31, 2010
closing common stock price of $76.80 per share). This repurchase program
supplements the previous 40 million share repurchase program, which had 8.5
million shares remaining as of October 31, 2010, for a total of 73.6
million shares remaining to be repurchased. Repurchases of the company’s common
stock under this plan will be made from time to time, at the company’s
discretion, in the open market.

A reconciliation of basic
and diluted net income per share attributable to Deere & Company
follows in millions, except per share amounts:

* Effects
on prior periods were not material.

All stock options
outstanding were included in the computation during 2010, 2009 and 2008, except
1.9 million options in 2010, 4.7 million options in 2009 and 2.0 million
options in 2008 that had an antidilutive effect under the treasury stock
method.

24. STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

The company issues stock
options and restricted stock awards to key employees under plans approved by
stockholders. Restricted stock is also issued to nonemployee directors for
their services as directors under a plan approved by stockholders. Options are
awarded with the exercise price equal to the market price and become
exercisable in one to three years after grant. Options expire ten years after
the date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest after three years. The
company recognizes the compensation cost on these stock options and restricted
stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite period the employee is
required to render service. According to these plans at October 31, 2010,
the company is authorized to grant an additional 19.8 million shares related to
stock options or restricted stock.

The fair value of each
option award was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice option
valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from
traded call options on the company’s stock. The expected volatilities are
constructed from the following three components: the starting implied
volatility of short-term call options traded within a few days of the valuation
date; the predicted implied volatility of long-term call options; and the trend
in implied volatilities over the span of the call options’ time to maturity.
The company uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and
employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options
granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents
the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The
risk-free rates utilized for periods throughout the contractual life of the
options are based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant.

The assumptions used for the
binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of options follow:

Weighted-averages

The weighted-average
grant-date fair values of options granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
$15.71, $13.06 and $27.90, respectively. The total intrinsic values of options
exercised during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $139 million, $12 million and $226
million, respectively. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, cash received from stock
option exercises was $129 million, $16 million and $109 million with tax
benefits of $51 million, $4 million and $84 million, respectively.

The company’s nonvested
restricted shares at October 31, 2010 and changes during 2010 in millions
of shares follow:

*
Weighted-averages

During 2010, 2009 and 2008
the total share-based compensation expense was $71 million, $70 million and $71
million with recognized income tax benefits of $26 million, $26 million and $26
million, respectively. At October 31, 2010, there was $30 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost from share-based compensation arrangements
granted under the plans, which is related to nonvested shares. This
compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
approximately 2 years. The total fair values of stock options and restricted
shares vested during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $71 million, $66 million and $74
million, respectively.

The company currently uses
shares that have been repurchased through its stock repurchase programs to
satisfy share option exercises. At October 31, 2010, the company had 114
million shares in treasury stock and 74 million shares remaining to be
repurchased under its current publicly announced repurchase program (see Note
23).

25. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS

26. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair values of financial
instruments that do not approximate the carrying values in the financial
statements at October 31 in millions of dollars follow:

*
See Note 18.

Fair values of the long-term
financing receivables were based on the discounted values of their related cash
flows at current market interest rates. The fair values of the remaining
financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts.

Fair values of long-term
borrowings and short-term secured borrowings were based on current market
quotes for identical or similar borrowings and credit risk, or on the
discounted values of their related cash flows at current market interest rates.
Certain long-term borrowings have been swapped to current variable interest
rates. The carrying values of these long-term borrowings included adjustments related
to fair value hedges.

Assets
and liabilities measured at October 31 at fair value on a recurring basis
in millions of dollars follow:

All
measurements above were Level 2 measurements except for Level 1 measurements of
U.S. government debt securities of $36 million and $32 million at October 31,
2010 and 2009, respectively.

Excluded from
this table are the company’s cash and cash equivalents, which are carried at
par value or amortized cost approximating fair value. The cash and cash equivalents
consist primarily of money market funds.

Fair
value, nonrecurring, Level 3 measurements at October 31 and related losses
in millions of dollars follow:

*

Does not
include cost to sell.

**

See Note 4.

Level 1 measurements consist
of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2
measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets; identical assets or liabilities
in inactive markets; observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves;
and other market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 measurements include significant
unobservable inputs.


Fair value is defined as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
In determining fair value, the company uses various methods including market
and income approaches. The company utilizes valuation models and techniques
that maximize the use of observable inputs. The models are industry-standard
models that consider various assumptions including time values and yield curves
as well as other economic measures. These valuation techniques are consistently
applied.

The following is a
description of the valuation methodologies the company uses to measure
financial instruments and nonmonetary assets at fair value:

Marketable Securities

– The portfolio of
investments is primarily valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model) in
which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or
corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves,
volatilities, credit risk and prepayment speeds.

Derivatives

–

The company’s derivative financial
instruments consist of interest rate swaps and caps, foreign currency forwards
and swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps. The portfolio is valued based
on an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs,
including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates for currencies.

Financing and Trade Receivables

– Specific reserve
impairments are based on the fair value of the collateral, which is measured
using an income approach (discounted cash flow) or a market approach (appraisal
values or realizable values). Inputs include interest rates and selection of
realizable values.

Goodwill

– The impairment of goodwill is based on the
implied fair value measured as the difference between the fair value of the
reporting unit and the fair value of the unit’s identifiable net assets. An
estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is determined through a
combination of an income approach (discounted cash flows) and market values for
similar businesses, which includes inputs such as interest rates and selections
of similar businesses.

Property and Equipment Held for Sale

– The
impairment of long-lived assets held for sale is measured at the lower of the
carrying amount, or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value is based on the
probable sale price. The inputs include estimates of final sale price
adjustments.

27. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

It is the company’s policy
that derivative transactions are executed only to manage exposures arising in
the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative
positions or trading. The company’s credit operations manage the relationship
of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease
portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign
currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities.
The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and
domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies
other than the local currencies.

All derivatives are recorded
at fair value on the balance sheet. Each derivative is designated as a cash
flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or remains undesignated. All designated hedges
are formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as
the risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis the
hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness, when applicable. If and
when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, or the
underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the hedge
designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is
discontinued. Any past or future changes in the derivative’s fair value, which
will not be effective as an offset to the income effects of the item being
hedged, are recognized currently in the income statement.

Certain of the company’s derivative
agreements contain credit support provisions that require the company to post
collateral based on reductions in credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of
all derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a
liability position at October 31, 2010 and 2009 was $16 million and $13
million, respectively. The company, due to its credit rating, has not posted
any collateral. If the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered,
the company would be required to post full collateral for this liability
position.

Derivative instruments are
subject to significant concentrations of credit risk to the banking sector. The
company manages individual counterparty exposure by setting limits that
consider the credit rating of the counterparty and the size of other financial
commitments and exposures between the company and the counterparty banks. All
interest rate derivatives are transacted under International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. Some of these agreements include
collateral support arrangements. Each master agreement permits the net
settlement of amounts owed in the event of early termination. The maximum
amount of loss that the company would incur if counterparties to derivative
instruments fail to meet their obligations, not considering collateral received
or netting arrangements, was $520 million and $740 million as of October 31,
2010 and 2009, respectively. The amount of collateral received at October 31,
2010 and 2009 to offset this potential maximum loss was $85 million and $81
million, respectively. The netting provisions of the agreements would reduce
the maximum amount of loss the company would incur if the counterparties to
derivative instruments fail to meet their obligations by an additional $58
million and $88 million as of October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
None of the concentrations of risk with any individual counterparty was
considered significant at October 31, 2010 and 2009.

Cash Flow
Hedges

Certain interest rate and
cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as hedges of
future cash flows from borrowings. The total notional amounts of the
receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate contracts at October 31, 2010 and
2009 were $1,060 million and $2,492 million, respectively.


The notional amount of the
cross-currency interest rate contracts was $849 million at October 31,
2010. The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these cash
flow hedges were recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and subsequently
reclassified into interest expense or other operating expenses (foreign
exchange) in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affected
earnings. These amounts offset the effects of interest rate or foreign currency
exchange rate changes on the related borrowings. Any ineffective portions of
the gains or losses on all cash flow interest rate contracts designated as cash
flow hedges were recognized currently in interest expense or other operating
expenses (foreign exchange) and were not material during any years presented.
The cash flows from these contracts were recorded in operating activities in
the statement of consolidated cash flows.

The amount of loss recorded
in OCI at October 31, 2010 that is expected to be reclassified to interest
expense or other operating expenses in the next twelve months if interest rates
or exchange rates remain unchanged is approximately $11 million after-tax.
These contracts mature in up to 39 months. There were no gains or losses
reclassified from OCI to earnings based on the probability that the original
forecasted transaction would not occur.

Fair Value
Hedges

Certain interest rate
contracts (swaps) were designated as fair value hedges of borrowings. The total
notional amounts of the receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate contracts at October 31,
2010 and 2009 were $6,640 million and $6,912 million, respectively. The
effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these contracts were offset
by fair value gains or losses on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings). Any
ineffective portions of the gains or losses were recognized currently in
interest expense and were not material during any years presented. The cash
flows from these contracts were recorded in operating activities in the
statement of consolidated cash flows.

The gains (losses) on these
contracts and the underlying borrowings recorded in interest expense were as
follows in millions of dollars:

Derivatives
Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

The company has certain
interest rate contracts (swaps and caps), foreign exchange contracts (forwards
and swaps) and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps), which were not
formally designated as hedges. These derivatives were held as economic hedges
for underlying interest rate or foreign currency exposures primarily for
certain borrowings and purchases or sales of inventory. The total notional
amounts of the interest rate swaps at October 31, 2010 and 2009 were
$2,702 million and $1,745 million, the foreign exchange contracts were $2,777
million and $2,156 million and the cross-currency interest rate contracts were
$60 million and $839 million, respectively. At October 31, 2010 and 2009,
there were also $1,055 million and $1,560 million, respectively, of interest
rate caps purchased and the same amounts sold at the same capped interest rate
to facilitate borrowings through securitization of retail notes. The fair value
gains or losses from the interest rate contracts were recognized currently in
interest expense and the gains or losses from foreign exchange contracts in
cost of sales or other operating expenses, generally offsetting over time the
expenses on the exposures being hedged. The cash flows from these
non-designated contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement
of consolidated cash flows.

28. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA FOR THE YEARS ENDED
OCTOBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008

The company’s operations are
presently organized and reported in three major business segments described as
follows:

The agriculture and turf
segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm and turf equipment and
related service parts – including large, medium and utility tractors; loaders;
combines, cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related front-end equipment and
sugarcane loaders; tillage, seeding and application equipment, including
sprayers, nutrient management and soil preparation machinery; hay and forage
equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers
and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment and
walk-behind mowers, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and commercial
mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements; integrated
agricultural management systems technology; precision agricultural irrigation
equipment and supplies; landscape and nursery products; and other outdoor power
products.

The construction and
forestry segment manufactures, distributes to dealers and sells at retail a
broad range of machines and service parts used in construction, earthmoving,
material handling and timber harvesting – including backhoe loaders; crawler
dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders;
articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; and log
skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters and
related attachments.

The products and services
produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent
retail dealer networks and major retail outlets.

The credit segment primarily
finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and
turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the credit
segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment,
provides operating loans, finances retail revolving charge accounts, offers
crop risk mitigation products and held residual wind energy generation
investments until December 2010 (see Note 30).

Certain operations do not
meet the materiality threshold of reporting and are included in the “Other”
category.

Because of integrated
manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing support, a
substantial number of allocations must be made to determine operating segment
and geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues represent sales of
components and finance charges, which are generally based on market prices.

Information relating to
operations by operating segment in millions of dollars follows. In addition to
the following unaffiliated sales and revenues by segment, intersegment sales
and revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: agriculture and turf net
sales of $59 million, $32 million and $40 million, construction and forestry
net sales of $7 million, $4 million and $8 million, and credit revenues of $219
million, $248 million and $257 million, respectively.

*

Other revenues
are primarily the Equipment Operations’ revenues for finance and interest
income, and other income as disclosed in Note 31, net of certain intercompany
eliminations.

*

Operating
profit of the credit business segment includes the effect of its interest
expense and foreign exchange gains or losses.

*

Does not
include finance rental income for equipment on operating leases.

(continued)


*
Includes depreciation for equipment on operating leases.

*
Corporate assets are primarily the Equipment Operations’ retirement benefits,
deferred income tax assets, marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents
as disclosed in Note 31, net of certain intercompany eliminations.

The company views and has
historically disclosed its operations as consisting of two geographic areas,
the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S. and Canada, shown below in millions
of dollars. No individual foreign country’s net sales and revenues were
material for disclosure purposes.

*
The percentages indicate the approximate proportion of each amount that relates
to the U.S. only and are based upon a three-year average for 2010, 2009 and
2008.


29. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

Common stock per share sales prices from New York Stock Exchange composite transactions quotations follow:

At October 31, 2010, there were 27,458 holders of record of the company’s $1 par value common stock.

Quarterly information with respect to net sales and revenues and earnings is shown in the following schedule. The company’s fiscal year ends in October and its interim periods (quarters) end in January, April and July. Such information is shown in millions of dollars except for per share amounts.

Net income per share for each quarter must be computed independently. As a result, their sum may not equal the total net income per share for the year.

*

See Note 5 for “Special Items” and Note 4 for “Assets Held For Sale.”

**

Due to the dividend payment dates, two quarterly dividends of $.28 per share were included in the second quarter of 2009.

30. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

A quarterly dividend of $.35 per share was declared at the Board of Directors meeting on December 1, 2010, payable on February 1, 2011 to stockholders of record on December 31, 2010.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Deere & Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of consolidated income, changes in consolidated stockholders’ equity, and consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index under Part IV, Item 15(2). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control ove
r financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluatin
g the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s


internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrat
ed Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
