Business

General

Health
Care REIT, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that has been at the
forefront of seniors housing and health care real estate since the company was
founded in 1970.  We are an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio. Our
portfolio spans the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real
estate, including seniors housing communities, skilled nursing/post-acute
facilities, medical office buildings, inpatient and outpatient medical centers
and life science facilities. Our capital programs, when combined with
comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a
single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing,
repositioning and monetizing real estate assets.  More information is available
on the Internet at www.hcreit.com.

Our
primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder
value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities
to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases
in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we
invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate
and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, customer and
geographic location.

Depending
upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is
sufficient to fund operations, meet debt service obligations (both principal
and interest), make dividend distributions and complete construction projects
in process. We also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future
investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings
under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, internally generated
cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate
cash from net operating income and principal payments on loans receivable.
Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our
primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, has historically been provided
through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and
the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.

References
herein to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refer to Health Care REIT, Inc.
and its subsidiaries unless specifically noted otherwise.

Portfolio of Properties

Please
see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operation – Executive Summary – Company Overview” for a table that summarizes
our portfolio as of December 31, 2013.

Property Types

We invest in seniors housing and health care real estate and
evaluate our business on three reportable segments: seniors housing triple-net,
seniors housing operating, and medical facilities.

For
additional information regarding our segments, please see Note 17 to our
consolidated financial statements.

The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.

The
following is a summary of our various property types.

Seniors
Housing Triple-Net

Our
seniors housing triple-net properties include independent living facilities, continuing
care retirement communities, assisted living facilities, care homes with and
without nursing, Alzheimer’s/dementia facilities, skilled nursing/post-acute
facilities and combinations thereof. We invest primarily through acquisitions,
development and joint venture partnerships. Our properties are primarily leased
to operators under long-term, triple-net master leases. We are not involved in
property management.  Our properties include stand-alone facilities that
provide one level of service, combination facilities that provide multiple
levels of service, and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of
services.

Independent
Living Facilities.

Independent living facilities are age-restricted,
multifamily properties with central dining facilities that provide residents
access to meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service,
transportation and social and recreational activities.

Continuing
Care Retirement Communities.

Continuing care
retirement communities typically include a combination of detached homes, an
independent living facility, an assisted living facility and/or a skilled
nursing facility on one campus. These communities


appeal
to residents because there is no need to relocate when health and medical needs
change. Resident payment plans vary, but can include entrance fees, condominium
fees and rental fees. Many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance
fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services.

Assisted
Living Facilities

.  Assisted living facilities are state regulated rental
properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities, but
also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require
assistance with activities of daily living, including, but not limited to, management
of medications, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating and eating.

Care
Homes (United Kingdom)

.  Care homes, regulated by the Care
Quality Commission, are rental properties that provide essentially the same
services as U.S. assisted living facilities.

Alzheimer’s/Dementia
Care Facilities.

Certain assisted living facilities may include state-licensed
settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease
and/or other types of dementia.

Skilled
Nursing/Post-Acute Facilities

.  Skilled nursing/post-acute
facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of
individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these
properties are licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement.  All
facilities offer some level of rehabilitation services.  Some facilities focus
on higher acuity patients and offer rehabilitation units specializing in
cardiac, orthopedic, dialysis, neurological or pulmonary rehabilitation.

Care
Homes with Nursing (United Kingdom)

.  Care homes with nursing
facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of
individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these
properties are licensed for various federal and local reimbursement programs. 
Unlike the U.S., care homes with nursing in the U.K. generally do not provide
post-acute care.

Our seniors housing
triple-net segment accounted for 28%, 41% and 46% of total revenues (including
discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively.  We lease 177 facilities to Genesis HealthCare, LLC, an operator
of skilled nursing/post-acute facilities, pursuant to a long-term, triple-net
master lease.  In addition to rent, the master lease requires Genesis to pay
all operating costs, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, building repairs,
maintenance costs and all obligations under the ground leases.  All obligations
under the master lease have been guaranteed by FC-GEN Operations Investment,
LLC.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, our lease with Genesis accounted
for approximately 34% of our seniors housing triple-net segment revenues and
10% of our total revenues.

Seniors
Housing Operating

In
addition to the facility types described in “Item 1 – Business – Property Types
– Seniors Housing Triple-Net,” our seniors housing operating properties include
facilities classified in Canada as independent supportive living facilities.

Independent
Supportive Living Facilities (Canada).

Independent
supportive living facilities are age-restricted, multifamily properties with
central dining facilities that provide residents access to meals and other
services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation and social and
recreational activities.

Properties
are primarily held in consolidated joint venture entities with operating
partners. We utilize the structure proposed in the REIT Investment
Diversification Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA”
structure (the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code authorizing the RIDEA
structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008). 
See Note 18 for more information.

Our seniors housing
operating segment accounted for 56%, 37% and 32% of total revenues (including
discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively.  We have relationships with nine operators to own and operate 279
facilities (plus 44 unconsolidated facilities).  In each instance, our partner
provides management services to the properties pursuant to an incentive-based
management contract.  We rely on our partners to effectively and efficiently
manage these properties.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, our
relationship with Sunrise Senior Living accounted for approximately 40% of our
seniors housing operating segment revenues and 23% of our total revenues.

Medical
Facilities

Our
medical facilities include medical office buildings, hospitals and life science
facilities.  We typically lease our medical office buildings to multiple
tenants and provide varying levels of property management. Our hospital
investments are typically structured similar to our seniors housing triple-net
investments.  Our life science investment represents an investment in an
unconsolidated joint venture entity (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial
statements).  Our medical facilities segment accounted for 16%, 22% and 22%


of total revenues (including discontinued operations) for
the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  No single tenant
exceeds 20% of segment revenues.

Medical
Office Buildings

.  The medical office building portfolio consists of health care
related buildings that generally include physician offices, ambulatory surgery
centers, diagnostic facilities, outpatient services and/or labs. Our portfolio
has a strong affiliation with health systems. Approximately 93% of our medical
office building portfolio is affiliated with health systems (with buildings on
hospital campuses or serving as satellite locations for the health system and
their physicians).

Hospitals

. 
Our hospitals generally include acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation
hospitals, and long-term acute care hospitals. Acute care hospitals provide a
wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including, but not limited to,
surgery, rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories. Inpatient
rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with intensive
rehabilitation needs. Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services
for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care,
monitoring or emergency support than is available in most skilled nursing
facilities.

Life
Science Facilities

.  The life science portfolio consists of laboratory and office
facilities specifically designed and constructed for use by biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies.  These facilities are located adjacent to The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is a well-established market known
for pharmaceutical and biotechnology research. They are similar to commercial
office buildings with advanced HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning),
electrical and mechanical systems.

Investments

Depending
upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in
the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate
returns to our stockholders.  We invest in seniors housing and health care real
estate primarily through acquisitions, developments and joint venture
partnerships. For additional information regarding acquisition and development
activity, please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.  We
diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and
geographic location. In determining whether to invest in a property, we focus
on the following: (1) the experience of the obligor’s/partner’s management
team; (2) the historical and projected financial and operational
performance of the property; (3) the credit of the obligor/partner;
(4) the security for any lease or loan; (5) the real estate attributes of
the building and its location; (6) the capital committed to the property
by the obligor/partner; and (7) the operating fundamentals of the applicable
industry. We conduct market research and analysis for all potential
investments. In addition, we review the value of all properties, the interest
rates and covenant requirements of any facility-level debt to be assumed at the
time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any
existing debt that is not to be assumed at the time of the acquisition.

We
monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of
property. Our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors
housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements
and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner
creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance
relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other
collateral. Our internal property management division actively manages and
monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process
including review of, among other things, tenant relations, lease expirations,
the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships,
property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions. In
monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect
and analyze property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research
to ascertain industry trends.

We
evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the
likely trend in operating performance of the facility.  When we identify
unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk.
Through these efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to
address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability
of revenue and the value of our investment.

Investment Types

Real Property.

Our
properties are primarily comprised of land, buildings, improvements and related
rights.  Our hospitals and seniors housing triple-net properties are generally
leased to operators under long-term operating leases.  The leases generally
have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more
five to 15-year renewal options. Certain of our leases also contain purchase
options, a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for
less than full market value.  Most of our rents are received under triple-net
leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred
in the operation of the leased property. The tenants are required to repair,
rebuild and maintain the leased properties. Substantially all of these
operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with
fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line
basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment.
Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally
recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.


At December 31, 2013, approximately 92% of our hospitals and
seniors housing triple-net properties were subject to master leases. A master
lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single
lease agreement. From time to time, we may acquire additional properties that
are then leased to the tenant under the master lease. The tenant is required to
make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are
subject to the master lease. Typically, the master lease tenant can exercise
its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with
respect to all leased properties at the same time. This bundling feature
benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the
better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect
to the poorer performing properties. This spreads our risk among the entire
group of properties within the master lease. The bundling feature should
provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy.
Subject to certain restrictions, a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume
or reject each of its leases. It is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy
would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole, rather than
deciding on a property by property basis.

Our
medical office building portfolio is primarily self-managed and consists
principally of multi-tenant properties leased to health care providers. Our
leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense
reimbursement by the tenant. As of December 31, 2013, 76% of our portfolio
included leases with full pass through, 20% with a partial expense
reimbursement (modified gross) and 4% with no expense reimbursement (gross).
Our medical office building leases are non-cancellable operating leases that
have a weighted-average remaining term of eight years at December 31, 2013 and
are often credit enhanced by security deposits, guaranties and/or letters of
credit.

Construction.

We occasionally
provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of long-term
operating leases. We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds
used for the construction of properties owned by us. The amount capitalized is
based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of
interest that approximates our company-wide cost of financing. Our interest
expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. We also typically charge a
transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize
to income over the term of the resulting lease. The construction period
commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the
applicable property or the end of a specified period. During the construction
period, we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms
and conditions which require, among other things, periodic site visits by a
Company representative. During the construction period, we generally require an
additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds
and/or completion guaranties. At December 31, 2013, we had outstanding
construction investments of $141,085,000 and were committed to provide
additional funds of approximately $243,083,000 to complete construction for
investment properties.

Real Estate Loans.

Our
real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income,
principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by
first/second mortgage liens, leasehold mortgages, corporate guaranties and/or
personal guaranties. At December 31, 2013, we had outstanding real estate loans
of $332,146,000. The interest yield averaged approximately 8.4% per annum on
our outstanding real estate loan balances. Our yield on real estate loans
depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, average
principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate
adjustments. The real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2013 are
generally subject to one to 15-year terms with principal amortization schedules
and/or balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the
term. Typically, real estate loans are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized
with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the
obligor and its affiliates.

Investments in
Unconsolidated Entities

.  Our investments in unconsolidated entities
generally represent interests ranging from 10% to 50% in real estate assets.  Investments
in less than majority owned entities are reported under the equity method of
accounting when our interests represent either (1) general partnership interests
subject to substantive participating or kick-out rights that have been granted
to the limited partners, or (2) limited partnership interests with no control over
major operating and financial policies of the entities. Under the equity method
of accounting, our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in
our consolidated results of operations. To the extent that our cost basis is
different from the basis reflected at the entity level, the basis difference is
generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities, and
such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the
entity.  The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities
is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest or the estimated
fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the entity. Other
equity investments include an investment in available-for-sale securities.
These equity investments represented a minimal ownership interest in these
companies. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon
a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its
carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such
an investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment
is recorded.  See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more
information.

Principles of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control, through voting rights
or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.


At inception of joint venture transactions, we identify entities
for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable
interest entities” or “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the
primary beneficiary of its operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity
where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a
controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is
insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional
subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined
to be the primary beneficiary.  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810,

Consolidations

,

requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining
whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis. This
evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the
activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance.

For
investments in joint ventures, we evaluate the type of rights held by the
limited partner(s), which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which
the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership.
The assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption
of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be
made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed
if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the
rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general

partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests, or
(iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding
limited partnership interests. We similarly evaluate the rights of managing
members of limited liability companies.

Borrowing Policies

We
utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments. Our debt and
equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit
profile. Generally, we intend to issue unsecured, fixed-rate public debt with
long-term maturities to approximate the maturities on our triple-net leases and
loans. For short-term purposes, we may borrow on our primary unsecured line of
credit arrangement. We replace these borrowings with long-term capital such as
senior unsecured notes, common stock or preferred stock. When terms are deemed
favorable, we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage
indebtedness. In addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged
properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a
leveraged basis. In certain agreements with our lenders, we are subject to
restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness.

Competition

We
compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate partnerships,
private equity and hedge fund investors, banks, insurance companies,
finance/investment companies, government-sponsored agencies, taxable and
tax-exempt bond funds, health care operators, developers and other investors in
the acquisition, development, leasing and financing of health care and seniors
housing properties. We compete for investments based on a number of factors
including investment structures, underwriting criteria and reputation. Our
ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends,
availability of acceptable investment opportunities, our ability to negotiate
beneficial investment terms, availability and cost of capital, construction and
renovation costs and new and existing laws and regulations.

The
operators/tenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with
operators/tenants of properties that provide comparable services.
Operators/tenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of
factors including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of
properties, location, services offered, family preferences, physicians, staff
and price. We also face competition from other health care facilities for
tenants, such as physicians and other health care providers that provide
comparable facilities and services.

Certain Government
Regulations

United States

Health
Law Matters — Generally


Typically, operators of seniors housing
facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are
largely subject to state laws, as opposed to federal laws. Operators of skilled
nursing facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government
programs, and these facilities are subject to the federal and state laws that
regulate the type and quality of the medical and/or nursing care provided,
ancillary services (

e.g.,

respiratory, occupational, physical and
infusion therapies), qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing
staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment, reimbursement and rate
setting and operating policies.  In addition, as described below, operators of
these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to
health care fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, the Federal
Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal Stark Law, and the Federal False Claims Act,
as well as comparable state law counterparts.  Hospitals, physician group
practice clinics, and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio
are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure, registration,
certification, and inspection laws, regulations, and industry standards. Our tenants’
failure to comply with any of these, and other, laws could result in loss of
accreditation; denial of reimbursement; imposition of fines; suspension,
decertification, or exclusion from federal and state health care programs; loss
of license; or closure of the facility.

Licensing
and Certification

The primary regulations that affect seniors housing
facilities with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws. In
granting and renewing these licenses, the state regulatory agencies consider
numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations,
including, but not limited to, admission and discharge standards, staffing, and
training. A decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property
owner’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights, medication
guidelines, and rules.  Certain of the seniors housing facilities mortgaged to
or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee, a
portion of which may be refundable.  These entrance fee communities are subject
to significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of
each facility’s financial condition; establishment and monitoring of reserve
requirements, and other financial restrictions; the right of residents to
cancel their contracts within a specified period of time; lien rights in favor
of residents; restrictions on change of ownership; and similar matters.  Such
oversight, and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities,
may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such
facilities, and, therefore, may adversely affect us.

Certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and
certificate of need (“CON”) laws and regulations.  Where applicable, CON laws
generally require, among other requirements, that a facility demonstrate the
need for (1) constructing a new facility, (2) adding beds or expanding an
existing facility, (3) investing in major capital equipment or adding new
services, (4) changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed
facility, or (5) terminating services that have been previously approved
through the CON process.  Certain state CON laws and regulations may restrict
the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s
size or services. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an
operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a
new operator.  If we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating
in a federal or state health care program (as discussed below), our ability to
replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s CON laws,
regulations, and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control.

With respect to licensure, generally our skilled nursing facilities and acute
care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in
Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs.  This generally
requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or bi-annual
basis. The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license
or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct
serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those
operators to discontinue operations at a property.  In addition, if a property
is found to be out of compliance with Medicare, Medicaid, or other health care
program conditions of participation, the property operator may be excluded from
participating in those government health care programs.  Any such occurrence
may impair an operator’s ability to meet their financial obligations to us.  If
we have to replace an excluded-property operator, our ability to replace the
operator may be affected by federal and state laws, regulations, and applicable
guidance governing changes in provider control. This may result in payment
delays, an inability to find a replacement operator, a significant working
capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties.

Reimbursement

Seniors Housing Facilities (excluding skilled nursing facilities).

Approximately 71% of our overall revenues
(including discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2013 were
attributable to seniors housing facilities. The majority of the revenues
received by the operators of these facilities are from private pay sources. The
remaining revenue source is primarily Medicaid under certain waiver programs.
As a part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) of 1981, Congress
established a waiver program enabling some states to offer Medicaid
reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative to institutional
long-term care services. The provisions of OBRA and the subsequent OBRA Acts of
1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical Medicaid requirements
to develop cost-effective alternatives to long-term care, including Medicaid
payments for assisted living and home health. As of September 30, 2013, ten of
our forty seniors housing operators received Medicaid


reimbursement
pursuant to Medicaid waiver programs. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2013, approximately 2% of the revenues at our seniors
housing facilities were from Medicaid reimbursement. There can be no guarantee
that a state Medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to
maintain its waiver status.

Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and are determined
by local market conditions and operating costs. Generally, facilities receive a
higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a Medicaid
beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid
reimbursement varies from state to state.  Thus, the revenues generated by
operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor
mix, acuity level, changes in Medicaid eligibility, and reimbursement levels. 
In addition, a state could lose its Medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted
to utilize Medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services. Changes
in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s
ability to meet its obligations to us.

Skilled Nursing Facilities and Hospitals.

Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals typically receive
most of their revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the
balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors, including
private insurers.  Consequently, changes in federal or state reimbursement
policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses,
including our rent or debt service. Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals
are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews, and other audits by
federal and state authorities.  A review or audit of a property operator’s
claims could result in recoupments, denials, or delay of payments in the
future, which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to
meet its financial obligations to us.  Due to the significant judgments and
estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting, no assurance can be given as
to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover
potential adjustments to reimbursements, or to cover settlements made to
payors.  In fact, in December 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services
(“HHS”) Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) released a report focusing on
skilled nursing facilities’ billing practices for Medicare Part A payments and
found that, between 2006-2008, skilled nursing facilities increasingly billed
for higher paying Resource Utilization Groups (“RUGs”), the payment
classification mechanism for the Medicare program, even though beneficiary
characteristics remained largely unchanged.  In particular, from 2006 to 2008,
OIG found that the percentage of RUGs for ultra high therapy increased from 17%
to 28%, despite the fact that beneficiaries’ ages and diagnoses at admission
were largely unchanged during that time period. In November 2012, the OIG
released a report focused on inappropriate payments to skilled nursing
facilities, and found that of the 499 claims from 2009 that were reviewed in
the study, skilled nursing facilities billed 25% of the claims in error and
misreported information on the Minimum Data Set (“MDS”) for 47% of the
claims.   In February 2013, OIG issued the third report in this series,
concluding that Medicare paid $5.1 billion to skilled nursing facilities for
stays that did not meet certain quality-of-care requirements.  Recent attention
on skilled nursing billing practices and payments or ongoing government
pressure to reduce spending by government health care programs, could result in
lower payments to skilled nursing facilities and, as a result, may impair an
operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us.

Medicare Reimbursement and Skilled Nursing Facilities.

For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2013, approximately 29% of the revenues at our skilled
nursing facilities (which comprised 12% of our overall revenues, including
discontinued operations, for the year ended December 31, 2013) were paid
by Medicare. Skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under the Medicare
Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System (“SNF PPS”). There is a
risk that some skilled nursing facilities’ costs will exceed the fixed payments
under the SNF PPS, and there is also a risk that payments under the SNF PPS may
be set below the costs to provide certain items and services, which could
result in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities, and
could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection. Skilled nursing facilities
have faced these types of difficulties since the implementation of the SNF PPS.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), an agency of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), made a positive
payment update for skilled nursing facilities for fiscal year 2014.  On July
31, 2013, CMS issued a final rule for the SNF PPS that sets forth payment rate
changes for the 2014 fiscal year.  Under the final rule, SNFs will receive a
net payment increase of 1.3%, which is based on a 2.3% increase in the SNF
market basket, less a 0.5% forecast error adjustment, and less a 0.5%
multi-factor productivity adjustment.  CMS is implementing a forecast error
adjustment because the forecasted fiscal year 2012 market basket percentage
change exceeded the actual SNF market basket percentage change by 0.51%, a
figure that is in excess of the 0.5% threshold adopted by the agency for
determining when a forecast error adjustment will be applied.

In addition, on November 21, 2011, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit
Reduction, which was created by the Budget Control Act of 2011, concluded its
work, and issued a statement that it was not able to make a bipartisan
agreement, thus triggering the sequestration process.  On January 2, 2013,
President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012
(“Taxpayer Relief Act”), which delayed the sequestration process until March
2013.  The sequester went into effect March 1, 2013 and, effective April 1,
2013, provider payments under Medicare Parts A and B, Medicare Advantage, and
Medicare Part D were reduced up to 2% annually.  However, Medicaid spending and
most of the spending on subsidies are exempt from reduction.    On January 21,
2014, President Obama signed the fiscal year 2014 omnibus appropriations bill,
which lifted the sequester that went info effect on March 1,


2013.  The Taxpayer Relief Act also increased the
multiple procedure discount for Part B therapy services from 25% to 50%
effective April 2013, which will lower revenues for certain operators or
tenants.

Section 5008 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 directed the Secretary
of HHS to conduct a Post Acute Care Payment Reform Demonstration (“PAC-PRD”)
program, for a three year period, beginning January 1, 2008, to assess the
costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in a variety of
post-acute care settings, including skilled nursing facilities.  The
demonstration program’s results and recommendations were reported to Congress
in a January 2012 report.  The results and recommendations could lead to future
changes in Medicare coverage, reimbursement, and reporting requirements for
post-acute care.

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated caps on Medicare reimbursement for
certain therapy services. However, Congress imposed various waivers on the
implementation of those caps.  The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act
of 2012 (“Job Creation Act”) made a number of changes, including, effective on
October 1, 2012, applying the therapy caps to outpatient hospitals, creating
two new threshold amounts of $3,700 (one for each therapy cap amount), and
requiring a manual medical review process of claims over these new thresholds. 
CMS announced on March 1, 2013 that, until the agency provides further
guidance, all therapy claims that are suspended for Manual Medical Review of
Therapy Services above the $3,700 threshold will be subject to prepayment
medical review.  The Taxpayer Relief Act extended the Job Creation Act
provisions related to payment for Medicare outpatient therapy services and
extended the historical therapy cap waiver and exceptions process, but only
through December 31, 2013.  Pursuant to the calendar year 2014 Medicare
Physician Fee Schedule, the therapy cap limitation also applies to services
provided at critical access hospitals.  These therapy caps may negatively
impact payments to skilled nursing facilities.

If the waiver program is not reinstituted, patients will need to use private
funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps.  If patients are unable to
satisfy their out-of-pocket cost responsibility to reimburse an operator for
services rendered, the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to
us could be adversely impacted.

Medicare Reimbursement and Hospitals.

For
the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, approximately 57% of the
revenues at our hospitals (which comprised 3% of our overall revenues,
including discontinued operations, for the year ended December 31,
2013) were from Medicare reimbursements. Hospitals, generally, are reimbursed
by Medicare under the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (“PPS”),
the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”), the Long Term Care
Hospital Prospective Payment System (“LTCH PPS”), or the Inpatient
Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System (“IRF PPS”). Acute care
hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including,
but not limited to, surgery, rehabilitation, therapy, and clinical laboratory
services. Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for
patients with medical conditions that are often complex and that require more
intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than that available in most
skilled nursing facilities. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide intensive
rehabilitation services in an inpatient setting for patients requiring at least
three hours of rehabilitation services a day.

With respect to Medicare’s PPS for regular hospitals,
reimbursement for inpatient services is made on the basis of a fixed,
prospective rate, based on the principal diagnosis of the patient.  Hospitals
may be at risk to the extent that their costs in treating a specific case
exceed the fixed payment amount. The diagnosis related group (“DRG”)
reimbursement system was updated in 2008 to expand the number of DRGs from 538
to 745 in order to better distinguish more severe conditions.   The subsequent
addition of new DRGs has now raised the total number of DRGs to 751.   In some
cases, a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the
hospital’s losses exceed a threshold.

On August 2, 2013, CMS issued a final rule for the
Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System, which sets forth acute care and
long-term care hospital payment rate changes for the 2014 fiscal year, which
began on October 1, 2013.  Under the final rule, the Medicare rates for
inpatient services at acute care hospitals will increase by 0.7% and rates for
long-term care hospitals will increase by 0.4%, accounting for adjustments,
such as the multifactor productivity adjustment and the second year adjustment
for a three-year phase-in of a one-time 3.75% budget neutrality adjustment to
the long-term care hospital rate.  CMS finalized its proposal to let expire the
one-year extension of the existing moratorium on the 25% threshold policy, a
policy that imposes lower Medicare payments, in certain circumstances, on those
long-term care hospitals that admit more than 25% of their patients from a
single acute care hospital.  The expiration of the moratorium on the 25%
threshold policy will impact cost reporting periods which begin on or after
October 1, 2013.  Under the final rule, CMS also finalized a number of changes
to comply with the

Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“PPACA”) and the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the PPACA (collectively, the
“Health Reform Laws”)

.  Beginning in
fiscal year 2014, hospitals that rank among the lowest-performing 25% with
regard to hospital-acquired conditions will see a 1% reduction in Medicare
payment rates.  CMS will also increase the maximum payment reduction under the
Hospital Readmissions Reduction program, which began on October 1, 2012, to 2%
of payment amounts in fiscal year 2014.  For fiscal year 2014, CMS is increasing
the applicable percentage reduction, the portion of Medicare payments available
to fund the Value-Based Purchasing Program’s value-based incentive payments, to
1.25%, as required by statute.  CMS clarified its regulations to reflect an
existing policy that the Inpatient Prospective Payment System comparable per
diem amount is capped at an amount


comparable to what
would have been a full payment under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System
and that cap applies to short stay cases in long-term care hospitals with
discharges occurring on or after December 29, 2012.

Notably, from 2007 through the end of 2012, there was
a statutory moratorium imposed by the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension
Act of 2007 (“MMSEA”) and subsequent amendments on new LTCH beds and
facilities, which reduced the opportunities for expansion.  Now that this
moratorium has been lifted, such facilities have the option to increase their
capacity and services.  It is unclear at this time what impact, if any, this
change will have on our operators and tenants and our business, generally.

On July 31, 2013, CMS issued a final rule for the
Medicare Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities Prospective Payment System that
sets forth payment rate changes for the 2014 fiscal year.  Under the final rule
for fiscal year 2014, the Medicare rates for inpatient rehabilitation
facilities will increase by 1.8%, which includes a 2.6% market basket increase
factor, reduced by a 0.5% multi-factor productivity adjustment and an
additional 0.3% point reduction as required by the Health Reform Laws.

On December 10, 2013, CMS published the Medicare
Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment
System final rule for calendar year 2014, which sets payment rates for outpatient
care hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.  CMS estimates that the rates
and policies in the final rule will increase payment rates for ambulatory
surgery centers by 1.2%.

Medicare Reimbursement and Physicians.

CMS annually adjusts the Medicare
Physician Fee Schedule payment rates based on an update formula that includes
application of the Sustainable Growth Rate (“SGR”).  On November 27, 2013, CMS
issued the calendar year 2013 Physician Fee Schedule final rule, which called
for a negative 20.1% update under the statutory SGR formula.  With the
enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 on December 26, 2013, the
reimbursement cut that was to occur was replaced with a 0.5% increase for
services provided through March 31, 2014.  Congress has overridden the required
reduction every year since 2003.  The final rule continues implementation of
quality and cost measures that will be used in establishing a new
value−based modifier that would adjust physician payments based on
whether they are providing higher quality and more efficient care. The Health
Reform Laws, as defined below, require CMS to begin making payment adjustments
to certain physicians and physician groups on January 1, 2015, and to apply the
modifier to all physicians by January 1, 2017. Calendar year 2013 is the
initial performance year for purposes of adjusting payments in calendar year
2015.

Medicaid Reimbursement.

Medicaid is a major payor source for
residents in our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. For the twelve months
ended September 30, 2013, approximately 48% of the revenues of our skilled
nursing facilities and 3% of the revenues of our hospitals were attributable to
Medicaid reimbursement payments. The federal and state governments share
responsibility for financing Medicaid. The federal matching rate, known as the
Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (“FMAP”), varies by state based on
relative per capita income, but is at least 50% in all states. On average,
Medicaid is the largest component of total state spending, representing
approximately 23.7% of total state expenditures in state fiscal year 2011. The
percentage of Medicaid dollars used for long-term care varies from state to
state, due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements.
Within certain federal guidelines, states have a fairly wide range of
discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology.  Many states
reimburse long-term care facilities using fixed daily rates, which are applied
prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in
providing patient care. Reasonable costs typically include allowances for
staffing, administrative and general expenses, property, and equipment (

e.g.

,
real estate taxes, depreciation and fair rental).

In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse the
cost of providing skilled nursing services. Certain states are attempting to
slow the rate of growth in Medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or
restricting eligibility and benefits. Our skilled nursing portfolio’s average
Medicaid rate will likely vary throughout the year as states continue to make
interim changes to their budgets and Medicaid funding. In addition, Medicaid
reimbursement rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not
sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures.  President Obama’s proposed fiscal
year budget for 2013 included several proposals that would have lowered federal
spending for Medicaid, potentially impacting provider Medicaid reimbursement
rates.  The proposals included new limits on state provider taxes, phasing down
the existing Medicaid provider tax, and blending the Federal matching rate for
state Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.  Although the
President’s proposed fiscal year budget for 2014 did not include these
proposals, it nevertheless called for an overall reduction in federal health
care spending by $401 billion over ten years, with savings stemming from
several cost-saving proposals including reduced Medicare payments for long-term
care hospitals, SNFs, and other post-acute care providers.

The Medicare Part D drug benefit became effective
January 1, 2006. Since that date, low-income Medicare beneficiaries
(eligible for both Medicare and full Medicaid benefits), including those nursing
home residents who are dually eligible for both programs, may enroll and
receive outpatient prescription drugs under Medicare, not Medicaid. Medicare
Part D has resulted in increased administrative responsibilities for
nursing home operators because enrollment in Medicare Part D is voluntary
and residents must


choose between multiple
prescription drug plans.  Operators may also experience increased expenses to
the extent that a particular drug prescribed to a patient is not listed on the
Medicare Part D drug plan formulary for the plan in which the patient is
enrolled.

The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care
facilities continue to evolve.  Federal and state authorities have considered
and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may
negatively impact health care property operations.  The impact of any such
changes, if implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled
nursing and hospital property operations. No assurance can be given that current
revenue sources or levels will be maintained.  Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently,
or will be in the future, sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators
for their operating and capital expenses.  As a result, an operator’s ability
to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted.

Finally,

the Health Reform
Laws (further discussed below)

may have a significant impact on
Medicare, Medicaid, other federal health care programs, and private insurers,
which impact the reimbursement amounts received by skilled nursing facilities
and other health care providers. The Health Reform Laws could have a
substantial and material adverse effect on all parties directly or indirectly
involved in the health care system.

Other
Related Laws

Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and seniors
housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to federal,
state, and local laws, regulations, and applicable guidance that govern the
operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by
health care providers. Certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect
payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of
patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health
care programs. Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary
services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each
service. Still, other laws require providers to comply with a variety of
safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed
property and the quality of care provided.  Sanctions for violations of these
laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance may include, but are not
limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure,
immediate termination of government payments, and exclusion from any government
health care program. In certain circumstances, violation of these rules (such
as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one
property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to
sanctions, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs, as well as other government health care programs.  In the ordinary
course of its business, a property operator is regularly subjected to
inquiries, investigations, and audits by the federal and state agencies that
oversee these laws and regulations.

All health care providers, including, but not limited
to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and seniors housing facilities
that receive Medicaid payments) are also subject to the Federal Anti-Kickback
Statute, which generally prohibits persons from offering, providing,
soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an
individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made
under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Skilled
nursing facilities and hospitals are also subject to the Federal Ethics in
Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. The Stark
Law generally prohibits the submission of claims to Medicare for payment if the
claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the
physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that
does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under
the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions on physician self-referrals and submission
of claims apply to state Medicaid programs. Further, health care providers,
including, but not limited to, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and
seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments), are subject to
substantial financial penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the
Federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the Federal False
Claims Act’s “whistleblower” provisions. Private enforcement of health care
fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the Federal False Claims
Act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government.
These whistleblower suits brought by private individuals, known as

qui tam

actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients,
nurses and other employees.  Such whistleblower actions have been brought
against nursing facilities on the basis of the alleged failure of the nursing
facility to meet applicable regulations relating to its operations. 
Significantly, if a claim is successfully adjudicated, the Federal False Claims
Act provides for treble damages up to $11,000 per claim.

Prosecutions, investigations, or whistleblower actions
could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity,
financial condition, and operations, which could adversely affect the ability
of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us.  Finally, various
state false claim act and anti-kickback laws may also apply to each property
operator. Violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal
and/or civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability
of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us.

Other legislative developments, including the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), have greatly
expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened
its scope to include private health care plans in


addition
to government payors. Congress also has greatly increased funding for the
Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the
Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to audit,
investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud.  Moreover, a significant
portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several
years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud
investigation and prosecution efforts.

Additionally, other HIPAA provisions and regulations
provide for communication of health information through standard electronic
transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information. In
order to comply with the regulations, health care providers often must
undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts. 
Operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain
the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health
information about individuals. The Health Information Technology for Economic
and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act, passed in February 2009, strengthened the
HHS Secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for HIPAA violations
occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH directs the HHS Secretary to
provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business
associates (as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable
HITECH requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result
in an enforcement action. CMS issued an interim Final Rule which conformed
HIPAA enforcement regulations to the HITECH Act, increasing the maximum penalty
for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to
$1.5 million.  Higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple
requirements or prohibitions.  Additionally, on January 17, 2013, CMS released
a final rule, which expands the applicability of HIPAA and HITECH and
strengthens the government’s ability to enforce these laws.  The final rule
broadens the definition of “business associate” and provides for civil money
penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts
of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in
place. Additionally, the final rule adopts certain changes to the HIPAA
enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary
penalty structure provided by HITECH, and makes business associates of covered
entities directly liable under HIPAA for compliance with certain of the HIPAA
privacy standards and HIPAA security standards.  HIPAA violations are also
potentially subject to criminal penalties.

In November 2002, CMS began an ongoing national
Nursing Home Quality Initiative (“NHQI”). Under this initiative, historical
survey information, the NHQI Pilot Evaluation Report and the NHQI Overview is
made available to the public on-line. The NHQI website provides consumer and
provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes. The data allows
consumers, providers, states, and researchers to compare quality information
that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’ physical and
clinical needs. The posted nursing home quality measures come from resident
assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at
specified intervals during their stay. If the operators of nursing facilities
are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior
to those of their competitors, they may lose market share to other facilities,
reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental
payments.

Finally, government investigations and enforcement
actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically
over the past several years and are expected to continue. Some of these
enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the
application of the Federal False Claims Act. The costs for an operator of a
health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions
and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could
have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its
obligations to us.

United
Kingdom

Registration

In England, care home services are
principally regulated by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (the

“Act”) and associated Regulations.

The Act requires all persons carrying out “Regulated
Activities” in England, and the managers of such persons, to be registered.
Regulated Activities are defined in the Health and Social Care Act 2008
(Regulated Activities) Regulations 2010 and include (among other activities):

·

The provision of personal care for
persons who, by reason of old age, illness or disability are unable to provide
it for themselves, and which is provided in a place where those persons are
living at the time the care is provided; and

·

The provision of residential
accommodation, together with nursing or personal care.

Any person who carries on a regulated
activity without being registered in respect of that activity is guilty of an
offense under the Act. A person guilty of an offense is liable on summary
conviction, to a fine of up to £50,000, or to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding 12 months, or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine, or to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both.

Under the Care Quality Commission
(Registration) Regulations 2009, service providers and managers of Regulated
Activities must provide documentation demonstrating their ability to provide
the relevant service(s); in particular, registrants must be able to


demonstrate that they (or a nominated individual, if the
registered person is a company) possess good character, are physically and
mentally fit to carry on the regulated activity and have the necessary
qualifications, skills and experience to do so.

Service Standards and Notification
Obligations

The Health and Social Care Act 2008
(Regulated Activities) Regulations 2010 list the standards that must be met
when providing care services. The service providers’ legal obligations include:

·

Ensuring service users are
protected against receiving care or treatment that is inappropriate or unsafe;

·

Assessing and monitoring the
quality of service provision;

·

Safeguarding service users from
abuse;

·

Ensuring that service users and
others are protected against risks of a healthcare associated infection;

·

Protecting service users against
risks in relation to the unsafe use of medicines;

·

Meeting the nutritional needs of
service users;

·

Ensuring that the premises are
safe and suitable;

·

Ensuring that any equipment used
is safe, suitable and readily available when required;

·

Respecting and involving service
users;

·

Obtaining and acting in accordance
with the consent of service users to care and treatment;

·

Having in place an effective
complaints system;

·

Maintaining accurate records;

·

Operating effective recruitment
procedures; and

·

Having sufficient numbers of
suitably qualified, skilled and experienced employees and supporting workers
through training, professional development, supervision, appraisals and
qualifications.

Failure to comply with certain provisions
of the above Regulations is an offense, with a person guilty of the offense
liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £50,000.  Monetary penalty
notices may also be issued.

Under the Care Quality Commission
(Registration) Regulations 2009 certain matters must be notified to the Care
Quality Commission (the “CQC”), the government regulatory body overseeing the
provision of nursing and other care services in England. Events that must be
notified include (among others):

·

Where the service provider or
registered manager proposes to be absent for a continuous period of 28 days or
more;

·

A change of the registered person
or where the registered person is a company changes in the name or address of
the registered person, a change of director, secretary or other similar
officer, or a change of the nominated individual;

·

The death of a service user;

·

Incidents resulting in an injury
(provided certain conditions are met);

·

Abuse and allegations of abuse in
relation to a service user; and

·

Any event which prevents, or
appears to the service provider to be likely to threaten to prevent, the
service provider’s ability to continue to carry on the regulated activity
safely, or in accordance with the registration requirements.

Failure to comply with the
above notification obligations is an offense and a person guilty of an offense
is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £2,500.

Regulatory Oversight and Inspections

The Act also sets out the powers and
responsibilities of the CQC. Among other powers, the CQC administers the
compulsory registration system and issues guidance to care service providers on
how to comply with applicable standards set out in legislation.

The CQC is also empowered to carry out
inspections of care home premises to verify compliance with the standards set
out in legislation. The CQC’s current policy is to carry out routine
unannounced inspections at care homes at least once a year. Reports of all
inspections in England are published, as are details of enforcement actions
taken by the CQC, which can include issuing warning notices, restricting the
services that the provider can offer, stopping admissions into the care
service, issuing fixed penalty notices, suspending or cancelling the service
registration and prosecution.

Financial Assistance for Service
Users

Financial assistance for service users towards care home
fees is available from local authorities and is means-tested. The National
Health Service may also, in certain circumstances, contribute towards the costs
of nursing care.


Canada

Retirement homes and long-term care facilities are subject to regulation, and
long-term care facilities receive funding, under provincial law.  There is no
federal regulation in this area.  Set out below are summaries of the principal
regulatory requirements in the provinces where we have a material number of
facilities.

Licensing and Regulation

Ontario

Long-term care facilities, or nursing homes, receive government funding, are
licensed under the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007

and are governed by
the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.  The LTC Homes Act places a strong
emphasis on the protection of residents.

Retirement homes in Ontario are regulated under the Retirement Homes Act, 2010
(the “Act”).  Retirement homes do not receive any government funding; residents
pay for tenancy and services received at retirement homes.  Residents may
access publicly-funded external care services at the home from funded external
suppliers.

A license is required to operate a retirement home.  Licenses must be applied
for and are non-transferable.  Applications for licenses are directed to the
Registrar of the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority (RHRA).  All of the
homes in which we have an interest in Ontario are licensed as retirement homes.
One of the homes also has some licensed long-term care beds.

Licenses can have conditions imposed upon them or can be suspended in
circumstances where the operator is found to be in contravention of the Act. 
There is no set renewal period for licenses, and they terminate according to
the terms set out in the license itself, or if one of the enumerated triggering
mechanisms occurs (for example, if the operator ceases to have controlling
interest in the license).

The licensee of a retirement home must ensure that the care provided by the
home meets prescribed standards.  The Act and its regulations include a number
of detailed provisions with respect to care standards, safety plans in the
event of emergency or infectious disease, temperature control, cleanliness,
pest control, maintenance, food preparations, risk of resident falls and
behavioral management, among other things.  A care plan must be developed for
each resident of the home (with their consent). The Act establishes a Residents’
Bill of Rights, which provides residents with a list of rights, such as the
right to participate fully in decision-making with respect to care, the right
not to be restrained and the right to know what care services are provided and
their cost.  The Residents’ Bill of Rights can be enforced as a contract.

The Act requires a report to the RHRA when any person has reasonable grounds to
suspect abuse of a resident by anyone, or neglect of a resident by staff. 
Following a report to the RHRA, there is a mandatory inspection carried out by
the RHRA, which results in a report that is posted on the RHRA’s public
website. The most recent report must also be posted in the subject home, and be
readily available for review if requested thereafter.

The Registrar of the RHRA has the power to inspect a retirement home at any
time without warning or issue a warrant to ensure compliance with the Act. 
Compliance inspections occur at least every three years. The Registrar has the
power to make a variety of orders including, for example, the imposition of a
fine or an order revoking the operator’s license.  There is an appeal process
in place with respect to orders made by the Registrar.  The Act also enumerates
offenses, such as operating without a license, and provides for penalties for
offenses.

British Columbia

The Community Care and Assisted Living Act, the Residential Care Regulation,
and the Community Care and Assisted Living Regulation

(together, the
“B.C. Act”) regulate “community care facilities” (long-term care facilities) in
substantially the same manner as retirement homes are regulated under the
Ontario Act. The B.C. Act defines such a facility as premises used for the
purpose of supervising vulnerable persons who require three or more prescribed
services.

The B.C. Act also creates a separate regime for regulating “assisted living
residences,” which are facilities providing at least one but not more than two
prescribed care services. Assisted living residences are designed for those who
can live independently, but who require assistance with certain activities.
Unlike community care facilities, assisted living residences must be registered
with the registrar of assisted living residences, but do not require a license.
Nevertheless, assisted living residences must be operated in a


manner that does not jeopardize the health or safety of
its residents. If the registrar has reason to believe a residence is not being
operated in accordance with this standard, the registrar may inspect the
assisted living residence and may suspend or cancel a registration.  Most of
the residences in which we have an interest in B.C. are assisted living
residences, with one being an independent living residence.

Independent living residences offer housing and hospitality services for
retired adults who are functionally independent and able to direct their own
care.   Services available for residents can include, for example, meals,
housekeeping, monitoring and emergency support, social and recreational
opportunities, and transportation.

Québec

In Québec, retirement homes are regulated by the Act respecting Health Services
and Social Services (the “Act”) and the Regulation respecting the conditions
for obtaining a certificate of compliance and the operating standards for a
private seniors' residence (the “Regulation”), which refer to “private seniors’
residences.” Private seniors’ residences in Québec are required to obtain a
certificate of compliance. The Regulation is currently in the process of being
amended.

A certificate of compliance is issued for a period of three years, is renewable
and can only be validly transferred to another person with the written
permission of the regional licensing agency. An agency may revoke a temporary
certificate, or revoke or refuse to issue or renew a certificate of compliance
if, among other things, the operator fails to comply with the Act and the
Regulation, although the decision of the applicable agency can be contested
before the Administrative Tribunal of Québec. The agency may also order the
residence to take corrective measures, further to an inspection, complaint
and/or investigation. The agency is authorized to inspect a residence, at any
reasonable time of day, in order to ascertain whether it complies with the Act
and the Regulation.

Private seniors’ residences may belong to either or both of the following two
categories: those offering services to independent elderly persons and those offering
services to semi-independent elderly persons. The operator of a residence must,
for each category, comply with the applicable criteria and standards, with some
exceptions provided for residences with fewer than six or ten rooms or
apartments. The Act and the Regulation set out a number of detailed provisions
with respect to residents’ health and safety (including mandatory call-for-help
systems, safety plans in the event of fire or infectious disease, health
assessments, permissible control measures, as well as administration and
distribution of medication), meal services and recreation, content of
residents’ files, disclosure of information to residents, and staffing
requirements, among other things.

Other Related Laws

Privacy

We are generally subject to privacy legislation in Canada, including, in
certain provinces, privacy laws specifically related to personal health
information.  Although the obligations of custodians of personal health
information in the various provinces differ to some extent, they all include
the obligation to protect the information. Privacy laws in Canada are
consent-based and require the implementation of a privacy program involving
policies, procedures and the designation of an individual or team with primary
responsibility for a custodian’s privacy law compliance.  Mandatory breach
notification is a requirement under some laws.  Some laws require notification
where personal health information/personal information is processed or stored
outside of Canada.  One provincial law (in Quebec) provides for fines where an
organization fails to perform required due diligence before outsourcing
activities involving personal information to a service provider outside of the
province.

Some privacy regulators in Canada have order-making authority and others are
ombudspersons who make recommendations that may only be enforced by a court.
Under a number of privacy laws, a finding by a regulator that a custodian has
breached the law creates a right to apply to a court for money damages.  In
some provinces there is a statutory civil cause of action for breach of
privacy. In other provinces, the courts have recognized a limited common law
cause of action for breach of privacy.

The powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law
vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts.  Generally,
penalties are monetary in nature.  Private rights of action may also be
available and regulators have the authority to make public the identity of a
health information custodian that has been found to have committed a breach, so
that there is a reputational risk associated with privacy law violations even
where there are no monetary damages incurred. The notification of patients
(mandatory under some privacy laws) and other activities required to manage a
privacy breach can give rise to significant costs.

Other Legislation


Retirement homes may be subject to residential
tenancy laws, such that there can be restrictions on rent increases and
termination of tenancies, for instance.  Other provincial legislation
applicable to occupational health and safety, public health, and the provision
of community health care and funded long-term care/skilled nursing may also
apply to retirement homes.  In addition, municipal laws with respect to matters
such as fire safety, food services and zoning would also apply.

Taxation

Federal Income Tax Considerations

The following summary of the taxation of the Company
and the material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and equity
securities is for general information only and is not tax advice. This summary
does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types
of holders of stock or securities (including, but not limited to, insurance
companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging, integrated
conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in
securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities,
investors in pass-through entities and foreign corporations and persons who are
not citizens or residents of the United States).

This summary does not discuss all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular
investment or other circumstances. In addition, this summary does not discuss
any state or local income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax
consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal income tax
law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including
changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied
retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our securities as set forth
in this summary. Before you purchase our securities, you should consult your
own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state, local,
foreign and other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our
securities.

General

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment
trust (a “REIT”) commencing with our first taxable year. We intend to continue
to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT, but there is no guarantee
that we will qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for subsequent years.
Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety
of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to
income, assets, distribution level and diversity of share ownership as
discussed below under “— Qualification as a REIT.” There can be no
assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so
as to qualify or remain qualified.

In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general,
we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT
taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders. We may,
however, be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or
capital gain not distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our
net long-term capital gains, stockholders are required to include their proportionate
share of our undistributed long-term capital gains in income, but they will
receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such
gain.

Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to
federal income and excise tax as follows:

•     To the extent that we do not distribute all of
our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our
“REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the
undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates;

•     We may be subject to the “alternative minimum
tax” (the “AMT”) on certain tax preference items to the extent that the AMT
exceeds our regular tax;

•     If we have net income from the sale or other
disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business or other non-qualifying income
from foreclosure property, such income will be taxed at the highest corporate
rate;

•     Any net income from prohibited transactions
(which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily
for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than
dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an
involuntary conversion) will be subject to a 100% tax;

•     If we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95%
gross income tests (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our
qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be
subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross


income attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our
gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75%
gross income test (discussed below) or (ii) 95% of our gross income over
the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test
(discussed below) multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our
profitability;

•     If we fail to distribute during each year at
least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year,
(2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than
capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (3) any
undistributed taxable income from preceding periods, we will be subject to a 4%
excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed;

•     We will be subject to a 100% tax on the amount
of any rents from real property, deductions or excess interest paid to us by
any of our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” that would be reduced through
reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in order to more
clearly reflect income of the taxable REIT subsidiary. See
“— Qualification as a REIT — Investments in Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries;” and

•     We may be subject to the corporate “alternative
minimum tax” on any items of tax preference, including any deductions of net
operating losses.

If we acquire any assets from a corporation, which is
or has been a “C” corporation, in a carryover basis transaction, we could be
liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “C” corporation. A
“C” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay
full corporate level federal income tax. If we recognize gain on the
disposition of the assets during the ten-year period beginning on the date on
which the assets were acquired by us, then, to the extent of the assets’
“built-in gain” (i.e., the excess of the fair market value of the asset over
the adjusted tax basis in the asset, in each case determined as of the
beginning of the ten-year period), we will be subject to tax on the gain at the
highest regular corporate rate applicable. The results described in this
paragraph with respect to the recognition of built-in gain assume that the
built-in gain assets, at the time the built-in gain assets were subject to a
conversion transaction (either where a “C” corporation elected REIT status or a
REIT acquired the assets from a “C” corporation), were not treated as sold to
an unrelated party and gain recognized.  For those properties that are subject
to the built-in-gains tax, if triggered by a sale within the ten-year period
beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us, then the
potential amount of built-in-gains tax will be an additional factor when
considering a possible sale of the properties.  See Note 18 to our consolidated
financial statements for additional information regarding the built-in gains
tax.

Qualification as a REIT

A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or
association:

(1)     which is managed by one or more trustees or
directors;

(2)     the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced
by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;

(3)     which would be taxable as a domestic
corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to REITs;

(4)     which is neither a financial institution nor
an insurance company;

(5)     the beneficial ownership of which is held by
100 or more persons in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first
taxable year;

(6)     not more than 50% in value of the outstanding
stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding
its first taxable year, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer
individuals (which includes certain entities) (the “Five or Fewer
Requirement”); and

(7)     which meets certain income and asset tests
described below.

Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met
during the entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at
least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a
proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. For purposes
of conditions (5) and (6), pension funds and certain other tax-exempt
entities are treated as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception in
the case of condition (6).

Based on publicly available information, we believe we
have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in (5) and
(6) above. In addition, Article VI of our by-laws provides for
restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares. These


restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to
satisfy the share ownership requirements described in (5) and
(6) above. These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in
all cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in
(5) and (6) above.

We have complied with, and will continue to comply
with, regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders
requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock. If, despite
sending the annual letters, we do not know, or after exercising reasonable
diligence would not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer
Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer Requirement. If
we fail to comply with these regulatory rules, we will be subject to a monetary
penalty. If our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the
requirement, the penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply
were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty would be
imposed.

We may own a number of properties through wholly owned
subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified REIT subsidiary” if
100% of its stock is owned by a REIT, and the REIT does not elect to treat the
subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” will not
be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets, liabilities and items of
income, deductions and credits of a “qualified REIT subsidiary” will be treated
as assets, liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT. A “qualified
REIT subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax, and our ownership of the
voting stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions
against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than
10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5% of the
value of our total assets, as described below under “— Asset Tests.”

If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability
company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will
be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s, limited liability
company’s or trust’s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving our
share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited liability company or
trust, and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it
has in the hands of the partnership, limited liability company or trust. These
“look-through” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests
described below.

Income Tests.

There
are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that
we must satisfy for each taxable year.

•     At least 75% of our gross income (excluding
gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real
property,” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages
on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments.

•     At least 95% of our gross income (excluding
gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources
qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from dividends (including
dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries) and interest.

As to transactions entered into in taxable years
beginning after October 22, 2004 and on or prior to July 30, 2008, any of
our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into
by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to manage the
risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency fluctuations with
respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us, or such
other risks that are prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is excluded
from the 95% gross income test.

For transactions entered into after July 30,
2008, any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is
entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to
manage the risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency
fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be
incurred by us is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.

For transactions entered into after July 30,
2008, any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered
into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to
any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95% and 75%
gross income tests is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.

In general, a hedging transaction is “clearly
identified” if (1) the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction
before the end of the day on which it is entered into and (2) the items or
risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the
hedging transaction. An identification is not substantially contemporaneous if
it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction.

As to gains and items of income recognized after
July 30, 2008, “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will
not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test and “real
estate foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will


not
constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Real estate
foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain (as defined in Internal Revenue
Code Section 988(b)(1)) which is attributable to: (i) any qualifying
item of income or gain for purposes of the 75% gross income test; (ii) the
acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property
or interests in real property; or (iii) becoming or being the obligor
under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real
property. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes Internal Revenue Code
Section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit (a “QBU”) of a
REIT if the QBU itself meets the 75% gross income test for the taxable year and
the 75% asset test at the close of each quarter that the REIT has directly or
indirectly held the QBU. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any
other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.
Passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain
and foreign currency gain which is attributable to: (i) any qualifying
item of income or gain for purposes of the 95% gross income test; (ii) the
acquisition or ownership of obligations; (iii) becoming or being the
obligor under obligations; and (iv) any other foreign currency gain as
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.

Generally, other than income from “clearly identified”
hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business, any
foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing, or engaging in substantial
and regular trading, in securities will constitute gross income which does not
qualify under the 95% or 75% gross income tests.

Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real
property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a REIT only if
several conditions are met:

•     The amount of rent must not be based in whole or
in part on the income or profits of any person, although rents generally will
not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages
of receipts or sales.

•     Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as
rents from real property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT,
also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant, unless the
tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain other requirements are met
with respect to the real property being rented.

•     If rent attributable to personal property leased
in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total
rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such
personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property.”

•     For rents to qualify as rents from real
property, we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants, other
than through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom
we derive no income, except that we may directly provide services that are
“usually or customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the property
is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only,
or are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant for his convenience.”

•     For taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008,
the REIT may lease

“

qualified
health care

properties”

on an
arm’s-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the property is operated on
behalf of such subsidiary by a person who

qualifies as an
“independent contractor” and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively
engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any
person unrelated to us or our taxable REIT subsidiary, an “

eligible independent contractor

.

”

Generally, the rent that the REIT
receives from the taxable REIT subsidiary will be treated as “rents from real
property.”

A “qualified health care property” includes any real
property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to
the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate
care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility that
extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by
a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the Medicare
program with respect to such facility.

A REIT is permitted to render a de minimis amount of
impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect
to that property as rent from real property. The amount received or accrued by
the REIT during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to
a property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by the REIT
directly or indirectly from the property. The amount received for any service
or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than
150% of the direct cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or
providing the management or operation. Furthermore, impermissible services may
be furnished to tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary subject to certain
conditions, and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property
as rent from real property.

The term “interest” generally does not
include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in
part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount generally will
not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a
fixed percentage of receipts or sales.


If we fail
to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable
year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for such year if we are eligible
for relief.  These relief provisions generally will be available if
(1) following our identification of the failure, we file a schedule for
such taxable year describing each item of our gross income, and (2) the
failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful
neglect.

It is not now possible to determine
the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is imposed on an
amount equal to (a) the gross income attributable to (1) 75% of our
gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75%
income test and (2) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying
gross income for purposes of the 95% income test, multiplied by (b) a
fraction intended to reflect our profitability.

The Secretary of the Treasury is given
broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify
or not under the 75% and 95% gross income tests, or are to be excluded from the
measure of gross income for such purposes.

Asset Tests.

Within 30 days after
the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy several
tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At least 75% of the
value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash
items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation),
government securities and qualified temporary investments. Although the
remaining 25% of our assets generally may be invested without restriction, we
are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10% of either the
vote (the “10% vote test”) or value (the “10% value test”) of the outstanding
securities of any issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT
or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Further, no more than 25% of the total assets may
be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (the “25%
asset test”) and no more than 5% of the value of our total assets may be
represented by securities of any non-governmental issuer other than a qualified
REIT subsidiary (the “5% asset test”), another REIT or a taxable REIT
subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test and the 25% and 5%
asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter. There are special
rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to
changes in the value of the assets of a REIT.

Certain items are excluded from the
10% value test, including: (1) straight debt securities (as defined in
Internal Revenue Code Section 1361(c)(5)) of an issuer (including straight debt
that provides certain contingent payments); (2) any loan to an individual
or an estate; (3) any rental agreement described in Section 467 of
the Internal Revenue Code, other than with a “related person”; (4) any
obligation to pay rents from real property; (5) certain securities issued
by a state or any subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign
government, or any political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico; (6) any security issued by a REIT; and (7) any other
arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, is excepted
from the definition of security (“excluded securities”). Special rules apply to
straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as
partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If a REIT, or its taxable REIT
subsidiary, holds (1) straight debt securities of a corporate or
partnership issuer and (2) securities of such issuer that are not excluded
securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1% of such issuer’s
outstanding securities, the straight debt securities will be included in the
10% value test.

A REIT’s interest as a partner in a
partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value
test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt instrument
issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10%
value test (1) to the extent of the REIT’s interest as a partner in the
partnership and (2) if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income
(excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would qualify for the 75%
gross income test.  For purposes of the 10% value test, a REIT’s interest in a
partnership’s assets is determined by the REIT’s proportionate interest in any
securities issued by the partnership (other than the excluded securities
described in the preceding paragraph).

For taxable years beginning after
July 30, 2008, if the REIT or its QBU uses a foreign currency as its functional
currency, the term “cash” includes such foreign currency, but only to the
extent such foreign currency is (i) held for use in the normal course of
the activities of the REIT or QBU which give rise to items of income or gain
that are included in the 95% and 75% gross income tests or are directly related
to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75% asset test, and
(ii) not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and
regular trading in securities.

With respect to corrections of
failures as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test or the 5%
asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a REIT by disposing of
sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1% of
the REIT’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided
that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the
quarter in which the REIT first identified the assets. For violations of any of
the REIT asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that
exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid
disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter by taking
certain steps, including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month
period described above to meet the applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to
the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net
income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period of time that
the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and filing a schedule with the
Internal Revenue Service that describes the non-qualifying assets.


Investments
in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.

REITs may own more than 10% of the voting power
and value of securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries. We and any taxable
corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to
treat such entity as a “taxable REIT subsidiary.”

Certain of our subsidiaries have
elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT subsidiaries
are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are
permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed
directly by REITs without jeopardizing their REIT status. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries
will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can be no
assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will
be successful. To the extent our taxable REIT subsidiaries are required to pay
federal, state or local taxes, the cash available for distribution as dividends
to us from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced.

The amount of interest on
related-party debt that a taxable REIT subsidiary may deduct is limited.
Further, a 100% tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable REIT
subsidiary to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate is not
commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT subsidiary is permitted to deduct
interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions.

The Internal Revenue Service may
reallocate costs between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is
a lack of arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any deductible expenses
allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would increase its tax liability.
Further, any amount by which a REIT understates its deductions and overstates
those of its taxable REIT subsidiary may, subject to certain exceptions, be
subject to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may be made
in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest.

Annual Distribution Requirements.

In order to avoid being
taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to make distributions (other
than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders which qualify for the
dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of
(i) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the
dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the
after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property, minus (2) a
portion of certain items of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid
in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if
declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or
before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration. The
amount distributed must not be preferential. This means that every stockholder
of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as
every other stockholder of that class, and no class of stock may be treated
otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class. To the extent
that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least
90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be
subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates.  As
discussed above, we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain
other distribution requirements. We believe we have satisfied the annual
distribution requirements for the year of our initial REIT election and each
year thereafter through the year ended December 31, 2013. Although we intend to
make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution
requirements for subsequent years, economic, market, legal, tax or other
factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements. See “Item 1A — Risk
Factors.”

It is also possible that, from time to
time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%
distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount as may be
necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to, among other things,
(1) timing differences between (i) the actual receipt of income and
actual payment of deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and
deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or (2) the
payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us. In the event
that timing differences occur, we may find it necessary to arrange for
borrowings or, if possible, pay dividends in the form of taxable stock
dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement.

Under certain circumstances, in the
event of a deficiency determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be
able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a
year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year, which
may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year.
Thus, we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency
dividends; however, we will be required to pay applicable penalties and
interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend
distributions.

Failure to Qualify as a REIT

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any
taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any
applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate
rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as
a REIT will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions
be required to be made in any year. All distributions to stockholders will be
taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings
and profits allocable to these distributions and, subject to certain
limitations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for
corporate stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory
provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four
taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not
possible to state whether in all circumstances we


would
be entitled to statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could
result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to
pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities.

In addition to the relief described above under
“— Income Tests” and “— Asset Tests,” relief is available in the
event that we violate a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would
result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due to
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we pay a penalty of
$50,000 for each failure to satisfy the provision; and (3) the violation
does not include a violation described under “— Income Tests” or
“— Asset Tests” above. It is not now possible to determine the
circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
provisions.

Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock

Treatment of Taxable U.S. Stockholders.

The following summary applies to you only
if you are a “U.S. stockholder.” A “U.S. stockholder” is a holder of
shares of stock who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is:

•     a citizen or resident of the United States;

•     a corporation, partnership or other entity
classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political
subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•     an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•     a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is
able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has
the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions.

So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT,
distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated
earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not designated as
capital gain dividends) will be includable as ordinary income for federal
income tax purposes. None of these distributions will be eligible for the
dividends received deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.

Generally, for taxable years following the year ended
December 31, 2013, the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on
dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of
tax is 20%. Except in limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to
dividends paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not subject
to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital
gains distributed to our stockholders. The reduced maximum federal income tax
rate will apply to that portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect
to our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received by us from
non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT subsidiaries; (2) income from
the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate
income tax during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute 100%
of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or (3) the amount of any
earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT
year.

Distributions that are designated as capital gain
dividends will be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year), without regard to the
period for which you held our stock. However, if you are a corporation, you may
be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary
income.

If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net
long-term capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital gain,
your proportionate share of this net long-term capital gain. You would also
receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by
us on such retained capital gains, and you would have an increase in the basis
of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains
less your share of the tax deemed paid.

You may not include in your federal income tax return
any of our net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules may
also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be
apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution declared by us in October,
November or December of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be
treated as both paid by us and received by you on December 31 of that year,
provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than January 31
of the following year.

We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and
profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be
distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax discussed under
“— General” and “— Qualification as a REIT — Annual Distribution
Requirements” above. As a result, you may be required to treat as taxable
dividends certain distributions that would


otherwise
result in a tax-free return of capital. Moreover, any “deficiency dividend”
will be treated as a dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend,
as the case may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any other distributions
in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to
you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of
your shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax basis of your
shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has
been reduced to zero, after which these distributions will be taxable as
capital gain, if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets. The tax
basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss, if any,
realized upon sale of the shares of our stock. Any loss upon a sale or exchange
of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less (after
application of certain holding period rules) will generally be treated as a
long-term capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain
distributions with respect to these shares of our stock.

Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock
to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our
stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us, you will generally
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of
our stock. This gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock
as a capital asset.

If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment
can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of
redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as opposed to dividend
income) equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the
redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such
redemption: (1) results in a “complete termination” of your interest in
all classes of our equity securities; (2) is a “substantially
disproportionate redemption”; or (3) is “not essentially equivalent to a
dividend” with respect to you. In applying these tests, you must take into
account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common
stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must take
into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively
owned by you.

If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you
no longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity securities
or only own (actually and constructively) an insubstantial percentage of our
equity securities, then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would
be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and, thus, would
result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a distribution is “not
essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and
circumstances, and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption,
you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the
particular situation.

Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests
described above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your
shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of
the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits. If the
redemption is taxed as a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed
shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If
you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain circumstances, such basis
may be transferred to a related person, or it may be lost entirely.

Gain from the sale or exchange of our
shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum long-term
capital gain rate of 20% in the case of stockholders who are individuals and
35% in the case of stockholders that are corporations.  Pursuant to Internal
Revenue Service guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain
dividends as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as gain
taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%.  Capital losses
recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than
one year at the time of disposition will be considered long term capital
losses, and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the
stockholder but not ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may
offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year).

An additional tax
of 3.8% generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of U.S.
stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals, estates or
certain trusts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012.  Among other items, “net investment
income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain
attributable to the disposition of certain property, such as shares of our
common stock or warrants. In the case of individuals, this tax will only apply
to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000
($250,000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses, and
$125,000 for married individuals filing a separate return). U.S. stockholders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this
additional tax in their particular circumstances.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt U.S. Stockholders.

Tax-exempt
entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and
individual retirement accounts (“Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt
from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their
unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The Internal Revenue Service has
issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a REIT to an
exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares
of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the
exempt employee pension trust. Based on this ruling, amounts distributed by us
to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an
Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with
debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the
“debt


financed property” rules. Likewise, a portion of
the Exempt Organization’s income from us would constitute UBTI if we held a
residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit.

In addition, in certain circumstances,
a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a
percentage of our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension trust
holding more than 10% of our stock only if: (1) the percentage of our
income that is UBTI (determined as if we were a pension trust) is at least 5%;
(2) we qualify as a REIT by reason of the modification of the Five or
Fewer Requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated
as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension
trust; and (3) either (i) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the
value of our stock, or (ii) a group of pension trusts individually holding
more than 10% of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the
value of our stock.

Backup Withholding and Information
Reporting.

Under
certain circumstances, you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable
rates on payments made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange
of, shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply only if you:
(1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you
are an individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish
an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the
Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of
interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury,
that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the
Internal Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup
withholding.

Backup withholding will not apply with
respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and
tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor regarding
qualification for exemption from backup withholding, and the procedure for
obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather,
the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder
will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided
that the required information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. In
addition, withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders
may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their non-foreign status.

Taxation of Foreign Stockholders.

The following summary
applies to you only if you are a foreign person. The federal taxation of
foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many
considerations.

Except as discussed below,
distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the
form of ordinary dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital
assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of
30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the
required form evidencing the lower rate.

In general, you will be subject to
United States federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than
withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is
“effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States. A corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is, or is
treated as, effectively connected with a United States trade or business may
also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in addition to
regular United States corporate income tax. The following discussion will apply
to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected.
We expect to withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the
gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless (1) you file an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution
is “effectively connected” or (2) certain other exceptions apply.

Distributions by us that are
attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property
interest will be taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax
Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were gains “effectively
connected” with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, you will be
taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a
special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals.
Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a branch profits tax in
the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty
exemption.

We will be required to withhold from distributions
subject to FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of designated
capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the amount of any distributions
that could be designated as capital gain dividends. In addition, if we
designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent
distributions, up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld
against, will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.

Any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of
stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be
treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more
than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year. Foreign
stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received
from us on U.S. federal income tax returns and all distributions treated
as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any such
capital gain dividends) will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax
(unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as discussed above. In
addition, the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions.


Unless our shares
constitute a “United States real property interest” within the meaning of
FIRPTA or are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, a sale
of our shares by you generally will not be subject to United States taxation. Our shares will not constitute a United States real property interest if we
qualify as a “domestically controlled REIT.” We believe that we, and expect to
continue to, qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically
controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing
period less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by
foreign stockholders. However, if you are a nonresident alien individual who is
present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year
and certain other conditions apply, you will be subject to a 30% tax on such
capital gains. In any event, a purchaser of our shares from you will not be
required under FIRPTA to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares
are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a
domestically controlled REIT. Otherwise, under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be
required to withhold 10% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the
Internal Revenue Service.

Backup withholding tax and information reporting will
generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States that
are treated as: (1) dividends to which the 30% or lower treaty rate
withholding tax discussed above applies; (2) capital gains dividends; or (3) distributions
attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of U.S. real property
interests. Payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the United States
or conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is
subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the
beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a
U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the
beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or otherwise established an exemption.
You may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue
Service.

Withholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on certain payments to you or
certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds) and other
non-US persons receiving payments on your behalf, including distributions in
respect of shares of our stock and gross proceeds from the sale of shares of
our stock, if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due
diligence, disclosure and reporting rules, as set forth in recently issued
Treasury regulations. Accordingly, the entity through which shares of our stock
are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required.
Withholding will apply to payments of dividends made after June 30, 2014, and
to payments of gross proceeds from a sale of shares of our stock made after
December 31, 2016.  Stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from,
or reduction of, U.S. withholding taxes with respect to such dividends and
proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the Internal Revenue Service to
obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction.  Additional requirements and
conditions may be imposed pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement, if and
when entered into, between the United States and such institution’s home
jurisdiction. We will not pay any additional amounts to any stockholders in
respect of any amounts withheld. You are encouraged to consult with your tax
advisor regarding U.S. withholding taxes and the application of the recently
issued Treasury regulations in light of your particular circumstances.

U.S. Federal Income
Taxation of Holders of Depositary Shares

Owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if
you were owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary
shares. Thus, you will be required to take into account the income and
deductions to which you would be entitled if you were a holder of the
underlying series of preferred stock.

Conversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred Stock.

No gain or loss will be recognized upon
the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax
basis of each share of preferred stock will, upon exchange, be the same as the
aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged. If you held your
depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of
preferred stock, the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will
include the period during which you owned the depositary shares.

U.S. Federal Income
and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Debt Securities

The following is a general summary of the United
States federal income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder
that is a non-U.S. holder, as defined below, the United States federal
estate tax consequences, of purchasing, owning and disposing of debt securities
periodically offered under one or more indentures (the “notes”). This summary assumes
that you hold the notes as capital assets. This summary applies to you only if
you are the initial holder of the notes and you acquire the notes for a price
equal to the issue price of the notes. The issue price of the notes is the
first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold other than to
bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity
of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. In addition, this summary
does not consider any foreign, state, local or other tax laws that may be
applicable to us or a purchaser of the notes.

U.S. Holders


The following summary
applies to you only if you are a U.S. holder, as defined below.

Definition of a U.S. Holder.

A “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner
of a note or notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes:

•     a citizen or resident of the United States;

•     a corporation, partnership or other entity
classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political
subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•     an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•     a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is
able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has
the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions.

Payments of Interest.

Stated interest on the notes generally
will be taxed as ordinary interest income from domestic sources at the time it
is paid or accrues in accordance with your method of accounting for tax
purposes.

Sale,
Exchange or Other Disposition of Notes.

The
adjusted tax basis in your note acquired at a premium will generally be your
cost. You generally will recognize taxable gain or loss when you sell or
otherwise dispose of your notes equal to the difference, if any, between:

•     the amount realized on the sale or other
disposition, less any amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will
be taxable in the manner described under “— Payments of Interest”
above; and

•     your adjusted tax basis in the notes.

Your gain or loss generally will be capital gain or
loss. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if at
the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the notes for more than
one year. Subject to limited exceptions, your capital losses cannot be used to
offset your ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may offset
up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year).

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.

In general, “backup withholding” may apply
to any payments made to you of principal and interest on your note, and to
payment of the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your note before
maturity, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder and: (1) fail to
provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you are an
individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an
incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or
dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you
have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the Internal
Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup
withholding.

The amount of any reportable payments, including
interest, made to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of
tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be reported to you and
to the Internal Revenue Service for each calendar year. You should consult your
tax advisor regarding your qualification for an exemption from backup
withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable.
The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be credited
against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that correct

Non-U.S. Holders

The following summary applies to you if you are a
beneficial owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above (a
“non-U.S. holder”).

Special rules may apply to certain
non-U.S. holders such as “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive
foreign investment companies” and “foreign personal holding companies.” Such
entities are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the United States federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to
them.


U.S. Federal Withholding Tax.

Subject to the discussion below,
U.S. federal withholding tax will not apply to payments by us or our
paying agent, in its capacity as such, of principal and interest on your notes
under the “portfolio interest” exception of the Internal Revenue Code, provided
that:

•     you do not, directly or indirectly, actually or
constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of our stock entitled to vote;

•     you are not (1) a controlled foreign
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related, directly
or indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership, as provided in the
Internal Revenue Code, or (2) a bank receiving interest described in
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code;

•     such interest is not effectively connected with
your conduct of a U.S. trade or business; and

•     you provide a signed written statement, under
penalties of perjury, which can reliably be related to you, certifying that you
are not a U.S. person within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and
providing your name and address to:

•      us or our paying agent; or

•

a securities clearing
organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’ securities
in the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds your notes on your
behalf and that certifies to us or our paying agent under penalties of perjury
that it, or the bank or financial institution between it and you, has received
from you your signed, written statement and provides us or our paying agent
with a copy of such statement.

Treasury regulations provide that:

•     if you are a foreign partnership, the
certification requirement will generally apply to your partners, and you will
be required to provide certain information;

•     if you are a foreign trust, the certification
requirement will generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners
depending on whether you are a “foreign complex trust,” “foreign simple trust,”
or “foreign grantor trust” as defined in the Treasury regulations; and

•     look-through rules will apply for tiered
partnerships, foreign simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts.

If you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust,
you should consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these
Treasury regulations and the certification requirements applicable to you.

If you cannot satisfy the portfolio interest
requirements described above, payments of interest will be subject to the 30%
United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a properly executed
(1) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming an exemption from
or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable treaty or
(2) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI stating that interest paid
on the note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively
connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
Alternative documentation may be applicable in certain circumstances.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the
United States and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct
of that trade or business, you will be required to pay United States federal
income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although you will be exempt
from the 30% withholding tax provided the certification requirement described
above is met) in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as
otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a foreign
corporation, you may be required to pay a branch profits tax on the earnings
and profits that are effectively connected to the conduct of your trade or
business in the United States.

Withholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on payments of interest
(including original issue discount) and gross proceeds of sale in respect of
debt instruments to you or certain foreign financial institutions (including
investment funds) and other non-US persons receiving payments on your behalf,
if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence,
disclosure and reporting rules, as set forth in recently issued Treasury
regulations. However, the Treasury regulations generally exempt from such
withholding requirement obligations, such as debt instruments, issued before July
1, 2014, provided that any material modification of such an obligation made
after such date will result in such obligation being considered newly issued as
of the effective date of such modification. These withholding rules are
generally effective with respect to payments of interest made after June 30,
2014, and with respect to proceeds of sales received after December 31, 2016.
We will not pay any additional amounts to any holders or our debt


instruments in respect of any amounts withheld. You are
encouraged to consult with your tax advisor regarding U.S. withholding taxes
and the application of the recently issued Treasury regulations in light of
your particular circumstances.

Sale, Exchange or other Disposition of Notes.

You generally will not have to pay U.S. federal income tax on any gain or income realized from the sale, redemption,
retirement at maturity or other disposition of your notes, unless:

•     in the case of gain, you are an individual who
is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable
year of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific other
conditions are met;

•     you are subject to tax provisions applicable to
certain United States expatriates; or

•     the gain is effectively connected with your
conduct of a U.S. trade or business.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that
trade or business, you generally will be subject to U.S. income tax on a
net basis on the gain. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may
be subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected earnings and
profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items.

U.S. Federal
Estate Tax.

If you are an
individual and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the United States,
as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, at the time of
your death, your notes will generally not be subject to the U.S. federal
estate tax, unless, at the time of your death (1) you owned actually or
constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all our
classes of stock entitled to vote, or (2) interest on the notes is
effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.

Backup withholding will not apply to
payments of principal or interest made by us or our paying agent, in its
capacity as such, to you if you have provided the required certification that
you are a non-U.S. holder as described in “— U.S. Federal
Withholding Tax” above, and provided that neither we nor our paying agent have
actual knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as described in
“— U.S. Holders” above. We or our paying agent may, however, report
payments of interest on the notes.

The gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes
may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If you sell
your notes outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a
non-U.S. broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information reporting requirements
generally will not apply to that payment. However, U.S. information
reporting, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales
proceeds, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell
your notes through a non-U.S. office of a broker that:

•     is a U.S. person, as defined in the
Internal Revenue Code;

•     derives 50% or more of its gross income in
specific periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;

•     is a “controlled foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or

•     is a foreign partnership, if at any time during
its tax year, one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who in the
aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests in the
partnership, or the foreign partnership is engaged in a U.S. trade or
business, unless the broker has documentary evidence in its files that you are
a non-U.S. person and certain other conditions are met or you otherwise
establish an exemption. If you receive payments of the proceeds of a sale of
your notes to or through a U.S. office of a broker, the payment is subject
to both U.S. backup withholding and information reporting unless you
provide a Form W-8BEN certifying that you are a non-U.S. person or
you otherwise establish an exemption.

You should consult your own tax advisor regarding
application of backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the
availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from backup
withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a
payment to you will be allowed as a refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to
the Internal Revenue Service.

U.S. Federal Income
and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Warrants

Exercise of Warrants.

You will not generally recognize gain or
loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your basis in the debt securities,
preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock, as the case may be,
received upon the exercise of the warrant will be equal to the sum of your
adjusted tax basis in the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding
period in the debt securities,


preferred stock,
depositary shares or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the
exercise of the warrant will not include the period during which the warrant
was held by you.

Expiration of Warrants.

Upon the expiration of a warrant, you will
recognize a capital loss in an amount equal to your adjusted tax basis in the
warrant.

Sale or
Exchange of Warrants.

Upon
the sale or exchange of a warrant to a person other than us, you will recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized
on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in the warrant. Such gain
or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss
if the warrant was held for more than one year. Upon the sale of the warrant to
us, the Internal Revenue Service may argue that you should recognize ordinary
income on the sale. You are advised to consult your own tax advisors as to the
consequences of a sale of a warrant to us.

Potential Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax
Consequences

Current and prospective securities holders should
recognize that the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us
may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time
and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously
made. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under
review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue
Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and
revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes.
Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely
affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.

State, Local and Foreign Taxes

We, and holders of our debt and equity securities, may
be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions,
including those in which we or they transact business, own property or reside.
It should be noted that we own properties located in a number of state, local
and foreign jurisdictions, and may be required to file tax returns in some or
all of those jurisdictions. The state, local or foreign tax treatment of us and
holders of our debt and equity securities may not conform to the U.S. federal
income tax consequences discussed above. Consequently, you are urged to consult
your advisor regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign
tax laws with respect to any investment in our securities.

Internet Access to Our SEC Filings

Our
annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports
on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, as well as our proxy
statements and other materials that are filed with, or furnished to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission are made available, free of charge, on the
Internet at www.hcreit.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are
filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report
on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements
that constitute “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in the
federal securities laws. When we use words such as “may,” “will,” “intend,”
“should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate” or similar
expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters, we are making
forward-looking statements. In particular, these forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to, those relating to our opportunities to
acquire, develop or sell properties; our ability to close our anticipated
acquisitions, investments or dispositions on currently anticipated terms, or
within currently anticipated timeframes; the expected performance of our
operators/tenants and properties; our expected occupancy rates; our ability to
declare and to make distributions to stockholders; our investment and financing
opportunities and plans; our continued qualification as a real estate
investment trust (“REIT”); and our ability to access capital markets or other
sources of funds.

Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our
expectations discussed in the forward-looking statements. This may be a result
of various factors, including, but not limited to:

•

the status of the economy;

•

the status of capital markets, including availability and cost of
capital;


•

issues facing the health care industry, including compliance with, and
changes to, regulations and payment policies, responding to government
investigations and punitive settlements and operators’/tenants’ difficulty in
cost-effectively obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other
insurance;

•

changes in financing terms;

•

competition within the health care, seniors housing and life science
industries;

•

negative developments in the operating results or financial condition of
operators/tenants, including, but not limited to, their ability to pay rent and
repay loans;

•

our ability to transition or sell properties with profitable results;

•

the failure to make new investments or acquisitions as and when
anticipated;

•

natural disasters and other acts of God affecting our properties;

•

our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies occur;

•

our ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to assets
sold;

•

operator/tenant or joint venture partner bankruptcies or insolvencies;

•

the cooperation of joint venture partners;

•

government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement
rates and operational requirements;

•

liability or contract claims by or against operators/tenants;

•

unanticipated difficulties and/or expenditures relating to future
investments or acquisitions;

•

environmental laws affecting our properties;

•

changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting;

•

the movement of U.S. and foreign currency exchange rates;

•

our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT;

•

key management personnel recruitment and retention; and

•

the risks described under “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”

We undertake no
obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether
because of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

This section
discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and
financial condition. It does not describe all risks and uncertainties
applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the
following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet
identified or that we currently think are not material, actually occur, we
could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the value of our
securities could decline.

We group these
risk factors into three categories:

•

Risks arising from our business;

•

Risks arising from our capital structure; and

•

Risks arising from our status as a REIT.

Risks Arising from Our Business

Our investments in and
acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful
or fail to meet our expectations

We are exposed to
the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could
encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired
properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties might
require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our
ongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to an
operator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps to
ensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect our
results of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our
anticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject to
various conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing,
on anticipated terms, or at all.  We also may be unable to quickly and
efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios
of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.


Our
investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of
exclusive control over these investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure
to meet its obligations and disputes between us and our partners

We have entered
into, and may continue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures
with other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that
may not be present with other methods of ownership, including the possibility
that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions
when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certain
liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might
at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or
become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged
in a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additional
resources to resolve such disputes and could have an adverse impact on the
operations and profitability of the joint venture; and that our partner may be
in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions
or requests. In addition, our ability to transfer our interest in a joint
venture to a third party may be restricted. In some instances, we and/or our
partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause
us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner’s interest, at a time when we
otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire
our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash,
available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we may
be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise
prefer to retain it. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making
authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control the
properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest,
certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale,
acquisition or financing of a property.

We are exposed to operational
risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could
adversely affect our revenue and operations

We are exposed to
various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating
properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to
generate revenues. These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic
conditions; competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated
licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the
availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability
insurance coverage; state regulation and rights of residents related to
entrance fees; and the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a
result of unionization or otherwise). Any one or a combination of these factors
may adversely affect our revenue and operations.

Decreases in our operators’
revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’
ability to make payments to us

Our operators’
revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities are
primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and
rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may
continue to, come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget
shortfalls. Operating costs continue to increase for our operators. To the
extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses
result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the
credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be
relied upon. To the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may need
to record an impairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose
of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such
impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results.

The continued
weakened economy may also have an adverse effect on our operators and tenants,
including their ability to access credit or maintain occupancy and/or private pay
rates. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators
are materially adversely impacted by economic conditions, our revenue and
operations may be adversely affected.

Increased competition may
affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to

us

The operators of
our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of
properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services. We
cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to
achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet
all of their obligations to us. Our operators are expected to encounter
increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract
residents or expand their businesses.

The insolvency or bankruptcy
of our obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition

We are exposed to
the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and
interest or other payments due us, which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or
insolvency, or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency
proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide
us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate


payment
of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right to
terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and
unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the
bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed
for bankruptcy or reorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject to
insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect
unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest
in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies.

We may be required
to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve
the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a
property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we
have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another
tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to
and limited indemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition a
leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which
may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events occur, our revenue
and operating cash flow may be adversely affected.

We may not be able to timely
reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us

From time to time,
we will have cash available from (1) the proceeds of sales of our securities,
(2) principal payments on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,
including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or
similar financial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenues
and continue generating attractive returns, we expect to re-invest these
proceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with a
broad variety of potential investors. This competition for attractive
investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on
terms acceptable to us.

Failure to properly manage
our rapid growth could distract our management or increase

our
expenses

We have
experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time
and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future. This growth has
resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management. Future
property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on, and
require us to expand, our management, resources and personnel. Our failure to
manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and, in
particular, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows,
which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to
stockholders. Our growth could also increase our capital requirements, which
may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur
additional debt.

We depend on Genesis
HealthCare, LLC (“Genesis”) for a significant portion of our revenues and any
inability or unwillingness by Genesis to satisfy its obligations under its
agreements with us could adversely affect us

The properties we
lease to Genesis account for a significant portion of our revenues, and because
our leases with Genesis are triple-net leases, we also depend on Genesis to pay
all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in
connection with the leased properties. We cannot assure you that Genesis will
have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to make
rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy its obligations under our leases,
and any inability or unwillingness by Genesis to do so could have an adverse
effect on us. Genesis has also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless
from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in
connection with its business, and we cannot assure you that Genesis will have
sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable
it to satisfy its indemnification obligations.

The properties managed by Sunrise
Senior Living, LLC account for a significant portion of our revenues and
operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial
condition could adversely affect us

Sunrise Senior
Living, LLC manages our entire Sunrise property portfolio, which as of December
31, 2013, consisted of 125 seniors housing properties.  These properties
account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we rely on Sunrise
Senior Living, LLC to manage these properties efficiently and effectively.  Any
adverse developments in Sunrise Senior Living, LLC’s business or financial
condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and
effectively, which could adversely affect us.

Ownership of property outside
the United States may subject us to different or greater risks than those
associated with our domestic operations

We have operations
in Canada and the United Kingdom. International development, ownership, and
operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with
respect to our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are
not limited to, any international currency gain recognized with respect to
changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or
the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and
maintain our status as a REIT;

challenges with respect to
the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; changes in foreign political,
regulatory, and economic conditions, including regionally, nationally, and
locally; challenges in managing international operations; challenges of
complying


with a wide variety of foreign laws and
regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance,
operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings;

foreign ownership
restrictions with respect to operations in countries; differences in lending
practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide
financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;
and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the United States
that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act. If we are unable to successfully manage the risks
associated with international expansion and operations, our results of
operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

We do not know if our tenants
will renew their existing leases, and if they do not,

we may be
unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms, or at all

We cannot predict
whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms,
which expire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be
required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them. There
can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement
tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as
the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all.

Our operators’ may not have the necessary
insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses

In recent years,
skilled nursing and seniors housing operators have experienced substantial
increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims. As a
result, general and professional liability costs have increased in some
markets. General and professional liability insurance coverage may be
restricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the property operators’
future

operations, cash
flows and financial condition, and may have a material adverse effect on the
property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us.

Our ownership of properties
through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such

properties
upon breach or termination of the ground leases

We have acquired
an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in
the property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additional
properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. As
the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing
the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the
ground lease by us.

The requirements of, or
changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid,
could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial
condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’
ability to meet their obligations to us

Some of our
obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent
that an operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from
government payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be
subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments,
recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative
rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal
intermediaries or carriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level
or with respect to specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments
due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property. In
recent years, government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care
providers due to budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely
continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We
cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future
legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and
properties. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will
be available for services provided by any property operator, whether the
property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors.
Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement
rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity,
financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect the
ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us. See “Item 1 — Business —
Certain Government Regulations — United States — Reimbursement” above.

The Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as modified by the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”),
provides those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible
state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with
an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014,
when certain conditions are met. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme
Court upheld the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially
invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allows
states to elect not to participate in the expansion—and to forego funding for
the Medicaid expansion—without losing their existing Medicaid funding. Given
that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is
unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as of
late January 2014, roughly half of the states have made statements or otherwise
indicated that they do not intend to expand Medicaid coverage at this time. The
participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the


dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through
new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our
tenants. While the federal government will pay for approximately 100% of those
additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states will be expected to pay for part of
those additional costs beginning in 2017. In light of this, at least one state
that has passed legislation to allow the state to expand its Medicaid coverage
has included sunset provisions in the legislation that require that the
expanded benefits be reduced or eliminated if the federal government’s funding
for the program is decreased or eliminated, permitting the state to re-visit
the issue once it begins to share financial responsibility for the expansion.
With increasingly strained budgets, it is unclear how states that do not
include such sunset provisions will pay their share of these additional
Medicaid costs and what other health care expenditures could be reduced as a
result. A significant reduction in other health care related spending by states
to pay for increased Medicaid costs could affect our tenants’ revenue streams.
See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States —
Reimbursement” above and “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Health Care Industry — Health
Reform Laws” below.

More generally,
and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment
for health care products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit
and budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based,
far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy,
our business or that of our operators and tenants.

Our operators’ or tenants’
failure to comply with federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,
certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely
affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our
operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us

Our operators and
tenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal, state, local, and
industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations,
and standards. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these
laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial
of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion
from federal and state health care programs, loss of license or closure of the
facility. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability
to make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. See “Item 1 —
Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Other Related Laws”
above.

Many of our
properties may require a license, registration, and/or certificate of need (“CON”)
to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a
required license, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating
in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could
materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent
payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including
the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and
the construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or
other similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain
Government Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above.

Illiquidity of real estate
investments could significantly impede our ability to

respond to
adverse changes in the performance of our properties

Real estate
investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange
any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions
will be limited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value
for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. Our
inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments
could

adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to
the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in
particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the
real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our
ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us.

Unfavorable resolution of
pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition

From time to time,
we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and
other claims. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising
out of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which
such operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us
harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in
connection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution of
pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome,
litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly
divert the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future
litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government
proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or
interruption of our normal business operations.

Development, redevelopment
and construction risks could affect our profitability


At any given time, we may be in the process of
constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON and
license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use. The
operator also may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enter
into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third party payor
contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary
CON, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the completion
of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues
on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or
certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements
or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain
a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary
provider agreements or contracts.

In connection with
our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities,
we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning,
land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and
authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or our
abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be able to obtain
financing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with our
development activities, and we may not be able to complete construction and
lease-up of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt
service expense or construction costs.

Additionally, the
time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these
properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns.
Because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the
cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to
borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and
acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could
adversely affect our overall financial performance.

In deciding
whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions
regarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, we
estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy, rental rates
and capital costs. If our financial projections with respect to a new property
are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors, the
property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our
estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may
prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our
profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties that are not
fully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to
pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property.

We may
experience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters, which
could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, a
decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we
have invested in a property

We
maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on
our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe
are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and we
continually review our insurance programs and requirements. However, a large
number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to
revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or
natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods. We
believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside
consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to
cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes,
earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions and natural
disasters. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance
will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and
the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant
portion of the losses. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our
tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an
affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have
invested in an affected property.  In addition, we or our tenants may not
purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance
exceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative to
the risk of loss.

We may incur costs to
remediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have an
adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition

Under various
federal and state laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to
respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and
may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that
result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. We
may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in
connection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a
person based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or
borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property.
Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we
own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments are
designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe
qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities
arise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our
properties are subject to material environmental contamination. However,
environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur
costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of
our obligors.


Cybersecurity incidents could
disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information

Our business is at
risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to
gain unauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronic
security breaches. Such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to
gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more
sophisticated security threats. While we employ a number of measures to
prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts
will be successful in preventing a cyber attack. Cybersecurity incidents could
disrupt our business and compromise the confidential information of our
employees, operators and tenants.

Our certificate of
incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions

Our certificate of
incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions on
share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval
requirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for
or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our
incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit or
discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.

Our success depends on key
personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed

We are dependent
on key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our
executive officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have an
adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more than one could have
a material adverse impact on our business.

Risks Arising from Our Capital
Structure

We may become more leveraged

Permanent
financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of
public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption
of secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to
become more leveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion
of our cash flow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to
a downturn in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional
financing, or (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or
more of the rating agencies.

We are subject to covenants
in our debt agreements that may restrict or limit our operations and
acquisitions and our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt
agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of
operations and financial condition

Our debt
agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among
other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios
and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur
indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of
these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the
applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted
against such instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse impact on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Limitations on our ability to
access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future
investments or to meet our obligations and commitments

We cannot assure
you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future
investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature.  Our
access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or
no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market
conditions; the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and
potential future earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the
shares of our capital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; the
financial stability of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet
their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us;
changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; or default or
delay in payment by the United States of its obligations. If our access to
capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively
impact our ability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness,
fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders.

Also, the federal
government’s failure to increase the amount of debt that it is statutorily
permitted to incur as needed to meet its future financial commitments or a
downgrade in the debt rating on U.S. government securities could lead to a
weakened U.S.


dollar, rising interest rates and
constrained access to capital, which could materially adversely affect the U.S.
and global economies, increase our costs of borrowing and have a material
adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or
financial condition.

Downgrades in our credit
ratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of
capital

We plan to manage
the Company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current
profile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our
current credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or
all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and
availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on
our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.

Fluctuations in the value of
foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial position

As we expand our
operations internationally, currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect
our results of operations and financial position. We expect to generate an
increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as
the Canadian dollar and the British pound. Although we may enter into foreign
exchange agreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency
mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of
foreign currencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations
will not have a material adverse effect on us.

Our entry into swap
agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates
or foreign currency exchange rates

We enter into swap
agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate
and foreign currency exchange rate volatility. These swap agreements involve
risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations
under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective
in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency
exchange rates. When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a
risk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against which the swap
is intended to hedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may be
adversely affected.

Risks Arising from Our Status as
a REIT

We might fail to qualify or
remain qualified as a REIT

We intend to
operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner. If
we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that
will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations
and for distribution to our stockholders because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in
computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at
regular corporate rates;

•

we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly
increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could
not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the
year during which we were disqualified.

Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number
of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and
if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and other
income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could
distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we would not be
required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT is not required
to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an
excise tax. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax
Considerations” above for a discussion of the provisions of the Code that apply
to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a REIT.

In addition, if
we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would continue
to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated
earnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the
dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for
taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains
(currently at a maximum rate of 20%) with respect to distributions.

As a result of
all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our
ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value
of our common stock.


Qualification as a REIT involves the application of
highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited
judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect
our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify
as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain
qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Item 1 —
Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations” above.

The 90% annual distribution
requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in
otherwise beneficial transactions

To comply with the
90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible
excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. See “Item 1 —
Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a
REIT — Annual Distribution Requirements” above. Although we anticipate that we
generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy
the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we
may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%
distribution requirement, or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such
greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This
may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and
actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of
that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income,
on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal
amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash
deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to
enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing
differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow
funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that
we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute
other property or securities or engage in another transaction intended to
enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to
raise additional capital to meet our obligations.

The lease of qualified health
care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements

We lease certain
qualified health care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited
liability companies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which
lessees contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care
operations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary
lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they
are paid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a qualified health care property
with a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible
independent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions are
not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. See “Item 1 —
Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a
REIT — Income Tests”

above.

If certain sale-leaseback
transactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service as “true
leases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences

We have purchased
certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and
we may enter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any such
sale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease
will be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as
the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However,
depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the Internal Revenue
Service might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but
is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leaseback
transaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the Internal
Revenue Service, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for
depreciation and

cost recovery
generally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback
transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset
tests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective
with the year of re-characterization. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation —
Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Asset Tests” and
“Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations —
Qualification as a REIT — Income Tests” above. Alternatively, the amount of our
REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet
the REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year. See “Item 1 —
Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a
REIT — Annual Distribution Requirements” above.

Legal
Proceedings

From time to time,
there are various legal proceedings pending to which we are a party or to which
some of our properties are subject arising in the normal course of business. We
do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings will have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In August 2012, we
entered into a merger agreement with Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (“Sunrise”).
Following the announcement of the merger agreement, complaints were filed in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Chancery
Court for the State of Delaware challenging the merger. The complaints
challenged the merger on behalf of a putative class of Sunrise public
stockholders, and named as defendants Sunrise, its directors and us. The
complaints generally alleged that the individual defendants breached their
fiduciary duties in connection with the merger and that the entity defendants
aided and abetted that breach. The complaint filed in the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Virginia additionally alleged that the preliminary
proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Sunrise
failed to provide material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The complaints
sought, among other things, injunctive relief against the merger, unspecified
damages and an award of plaintiffs’ expenses, including attorneys’ fees.  On
January 9, 2013, we completed our acquisition of the Sunrise property
portfolio. Please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for
additional information.

On October 24, 2013,
the parties entered into a Stipulation of Settlement and Release that settled
the lawsuits subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia and the Chancery Court for the State of Delaware,
respectively. On January 24, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia approved the Stipulation of Settlement and Release and
dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, and, on February 6, 2014, the Chancery
Court for the State of Delaware approved the plaintiffs’ voluntarily dismissal
of the lawsuit with prejudice.

Business Strategy

Our
primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder
value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create
opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of
annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these
objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health
care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship
and geographic location.

Substantially
all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and
services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items
represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend
upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and
interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To
the extent that our customers/partners experience operating difficulties and become
unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a
material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity
and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments
through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our proactive
and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties
generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating
data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property
inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real
estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property
management division actively manages and monitors the medical office building
portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of, among other things,
tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers,
hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement
needs, and market conditions. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a
proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific data.
Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends.  We
evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the
likely trend in operating performance of the facility.  When we identify
unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk.
Through these efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to
address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability
of revenue and the value of our investment.

In
addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also structure our
investments to help mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are
normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition,
operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are
generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans,
operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

For the year ended December 31, 2013,
rental income, resident fees and services and interest and other income represented
43%, 56%, and 1% respectively, of total revenues (including discontinued
operations).  Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with
escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are
generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period,
subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with
contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual
cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends
upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average
principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate
adjustments.

Our
primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, resident fees and
services, borrowings under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement,
public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment
dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of
cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal
and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital
expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances,
property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses.  Depending
upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is
sufficient to fund these uses of cash.

We
also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments.  New
investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured
line of credit arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment
dispositions. Our investments generate cash from net operating income and
principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future
investments, which generally replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured
line of credit arrangement, has historically been provided through a
combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the
incurrence or assumption of secured debt.

Depending
upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in
the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate
returns to our stockholders. It is also possible that investment dispositions
may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new
investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely
affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions
in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our
available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured line of
credit arrangement. At December 31, 2013, we had $158.8 million of cash and
cash equivalents, $72.8 million of restricted cash and $2.1 billion of
available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured line of credit
arrangement.

Capital Market Outlook

The
capital markets remain supportive of our investment strategy. For the year
ended December 31, 2013, we raised over $3.7 billion in aggregate gross
proceeds through the issuance of common stock and unsecured debt. The capital
raised, in combination with available cash and borrowing capacity under our
primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, supported $5.7 billion in gross
new investments for the year. We expect attractive investment opportunities to
remain available in the future as we continue to leverage the benefits of our
relationship investment strategy.

Key Transactions
in 2013

Capital

.
In January 2013, we closed a $2.75 billion unsecured line of credit arrangement
consisting of a $2.25 billion revolver and a $500 million term loan.  The
facility replaced our existing $2.0 billion unsecured line of credit
arrangement. The revolver matures on March 31, 2017, but can be extended for an
additional year at our option.  The term loan matures on March 31, 2016, but
can be extended up to two years at our option.  The revolver bears interest at
LIBOR plus 117.5 basis points and has an annual facility fee of 22.5 basis
points.  The term loan, which was fully drawn as of December 31, 2013, bears
interest at LIBOR plus 135 basis points. We have an option to upsize the
facility by up to an additional $1.0 billion through an accordion feature,
allowing for aggregate commitments of up to $3.75 billion.  The facility also
allows us to borrow up to $500 million in certain alternative currencies. In
May 2013, we completed the public issuance of 23 million shares of common stock
for approximately $1.7 billion of gross proceeds.  In October 2013, we issued
$400 million of 4.5% 10-year senior unsecured notes, generating approximately $393
million of net proceeds. In November 2013, we issued £550 million of 4.8% 15-year
senior unsecured notes, generating approximately $868 million of net proceeds.
In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2013, we raised $215 million
through our dividend reinvestment program.

per share quarterly), as compared to $3.06 per common share for 2013, beginning
in February 2014.  The dividend declared for the quarter ended December 31,
2013  represents the 171

st

consecutive quarterly dividend payment.

Key Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties

We
utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of
our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating
performance, credit strength  and concentration risk.  Management uses these
key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to
our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget
planning purposes.

Operating
Performance

. We believe that net income attributable to common stockholders
(“NICS”) is the most appropriate earnings measure. Other useful supplemental
measures of our operating performance include funds from operations (“FFO”),
net operating income from continuing operations (“NOI”) and same store cash NOI
(“SSCNOI”); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Please refer to the
section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion and
reconciliations of FFO, NOI and SSCNOI. These earnings measures and their
relative per share amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the
valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of

Credit Strength.

We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios
and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet
capitalization is related to long-term debt. The coverage ratios indicate our
ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal
amortization and preferred dividends). We expect to maintain capitalization
ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain compliance with our debt
covenants. The coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) which is discussed in
further detail, and reconciled to net income, below in “Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.” Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors,
analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment
recommendations and rating of companies. The following table reflects the
recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods
presented:

Concentration Risk

. We
evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix, investment mix,
relationship mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure
in understanding what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain
sectors were to experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our
investments that are real property. In order to qualify as an equity REIT, at
least 75% of our real estate investments must be real property whereby each
property, which includes the land, buildings, improvements, intangibles and
related rights, is owned by us. Investment mix measures the portion of our
investments that relate to our various property types. Relationship mix
measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five
relationships.  Geographic mix measures the portion of our investments that
relate to our top five states (or international equivalents). The following
table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk by investment
balance for the periods presented:

We evaluate our key performance
indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical
trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be
achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are
described in more detail in “Item 1 — Business — Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and other sections of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management regularly monitors economic and other
factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance
and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial
objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and
to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends.
Please refer to “Item 1 — Business,” “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and “Item 7 — Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these risk factors.

Sources and Uses
of Cash

Our
primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, resident fees and
services, borrowings under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement,
public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment
dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of
cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal
and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital
expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances,
property operating expenses, and general and administrative expenses. These
sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash

Operating Activities

change in net cash provided from operating activities is primarily attributable
to increases in NOI which is primarily due to acquisitions.  Please see

31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, cash flows from operations exceeded cash distributions
to stockholders.

Investing Activities

.  The changes
in net cash used in investing activities are primarily attributable to acquisitions,
real estate loans receivable and investments in unconsolidated entities which
are summarized above in “Key Transactions in 2013.”  Please refer to Notes 3, 6

The decrease in new development is primarily due to a decline
in the number of properties under construction (resulting from completed
properties being placed into service), which is partially offset by new
construction starts.  The increase in recurring capital expenditures, tenant
improvements and lease commissions is primarily due to acquisitions.
Renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures
to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a
market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization.  Generally,
these expenditures have increased as a result of acquisitions. The decrease
during the year ended December 31, 2013 is attributable to a lower volume of
acquisitions in our medical facilities segment.

Financing Activities

. The changes in net cash provided from financing activities are
primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements,
the issuance/redemptions of common and preferred stock, and dividend payments
which are summarized above in “Key Transactions in 2013.”  Please refer to
Notes 9, 10 and 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

At
December 31, 2013, we had an unsecured line of credit arrangement with an
aggregate commitment amount of $2,250,000,000.  See Note 9 to our consolidated
financial statements for additional information.  Total contractual interest
obligations on this arrangement totaled $5,662,000, using the interest rate in
place at that date.

We
have $5,775,108,000 of senior unsecured notes principal outstanding with interest
payable semi-annually at fixed annual interest rates, ranging from 2.25% to
6.5%.  Of these notes, a total of $275,108,000 are convertible notes that also
contain put features.  In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we
issued £550,000,000 (approximately $911,570,000 based on the Sterling/U.S.
Dollar exchange rate on December 31, 2013) of 4.80% senior unsecured notes due
2028 generating net proceeds of $891,418,000.  We also entered into a
$500,000,000 unsecured term loan during the year ended December 31, 2013 that
matures on March 16, 2016 and can be extended for two additional years at our
option.  Furthermore, we have a $250,000,000 Canadian denominated unsecured
term loan (approximately $235,029,000 based on the Canadian/U.S. Dollar
exchange rate on December 31, 2013.)  The loan matures on July 27, 2015 and
includes an option to extend for an additional year at our discretion.  Please
see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional
information.  Total contractual interest obligations on all senior unsecured
notes and the term loans totaled $3,260,135,000 at December 31, 2013.

We have consolidated secured debt
with total outstanding principal of $3,010,711,000, collateralized by owned
properties, with annual interest rates ranging from 1.0% to 8.0%, payable
monthly. The carrying values of the properties securing the debt totaled
$6,243,475,000 at December 31, 2013. Total contractual interest obligations on
consolidated secured debt totaled $880,164,000 at December 31, 2013. Our share
of non-recourse secured debt associated with unconsolidated entities (as
reflected in the contractual obligations table above) is $403,392,000 at December
31, 2013.  Our share of contractual interest obligations on our unconsolidated entities’
secured debt is $65,353,000 at December 31, 2013.

At
December 31, 2013, we had operating lease obligations of $881,694,000 relating
primarily to ground leases at certain of our properties and office space leases
and capital lease obligations of $117,118,000 relating to certain lease
investment properties that contain bargain purchase options.

Purchase
obligations include unfunded construction commitments and contingent purchase
obligations. At December 31, 2013, we had outstanding construction financings
of $141,085,000 for leased properties and were committed to providing
additional financing of approximately $243,083,000 to complete construction. At
December 31, 2013, we had contingent purchase obligations totaling $65,217,000.
These contingent purchase obligations relate to unfunded capital improvement
obligations and contingent obligations on acquisitions. Upon funding, amounts
due from the tenant are increased to reflect the additional investment in the
property.

Other
long-term liabilities relate to our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, which
is discussed in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

Capital Structure

Please
refer to “Credit Strength” above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage
ratio trends.  Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain certain financial
ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur
indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December
31, 2013, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt
agreements. Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”
for further discussion. None of our debt agreements contain provisions for
acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our
primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, the ratings on our senior
unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. A summary
of certain covenants and our results as of and for the year ended December 31,
2013 is as follows:

(1) Canadian denominated term loan covenants are the same as

We plan to manage the
company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital
structure consistent with our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of
ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material
adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
liquidity and/or financial condition.

On
May 4, 2012, we filed an open-ended automatic or “universal” shelf
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering an
indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock,
preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units. As of January 31, 2014,
we had an effective registration statement on file in connection with our
enhanced dividend reinvestment plan under which we may issue up to 10,000,000
shares of common stock. As of January 31, 2014, 7,084,703 shares of common
stock remained available for issuance under this registration statement. We
have entered into separate Equity Distribution Agreements with each of UBS
Securities LLC, RBS Securities Inc., KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and Credit
Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. relating to the offer and sale from time to time
of up to $630,015,000 aggregate amount of our common stock (“Equity Shelf
Program”). As of January 31, 2014, we had $457,112,000 of remaining capacity
under the Equity Shelf Program. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate
issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional
properties and to repay borrowings under our unsecured line of credit
arrangements.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

The increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions
of new properties, the transition of 38 properties from our seniors housing
operating segment and the conversion of newly constructed seniors housing
triple-net properties from which we receive rent. Certain of our leases contain
annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price
Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s
properties.  These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is
recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash
rental payments due for the period.  If gross operating revenues at our
facilities and/or the Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our
revenues may not continue to increase.  Sales of real property would offset
revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions, could
result in decreased revenues.  Our leases could renew above or below current
rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  For the three
months ended December 31, 2013, we had no lease renewals but we had nine leases
with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.08% to 0.30% in our seniors housing triple-net
portfolio.  The decrease in interest income is attributable to loan payoffs
(see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional
information).

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, we completed eight seniors housing triple-net
construction projects representing $133,181,000 or $171,403 per bed/unit plus
expansion projects totaling $26,395,000. The following is a summary of seniors
housing triple-net construction projects pending as of December 31, 2013

Total interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 represents
$25,394,000, $13,572,000  and  $15,296,000, respectively, of secured debt
interest expense offset by interest allocated to discontinued operations in the
amounts of $2,072,000, $11,827,000 and $18,098,000 for the years ended December
31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The change in secured debt interest
expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment
transitions, extinguishments and principal amortizations. The following is a

In connection with secured debt extinguishments, we
recognized losses of $2,405,000 and $40,000 during the years ended December 31,
2012 and 2013, respectively.  The decrease in loss on debt extinguishment is
attributable to the decreased volume of debt payoffs.  Derivative losses during
the year ended December 31, 2013 were incurred in conjunction with certain
foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to properties acquired in
the United Kingdom. Please refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial
statements for further discussion.


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

Depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of
new property acquisitions and the conversions of newly constructed properties.
To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the
future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change
accordingly.

Transaction costs represent costs incurred with property
acquisitions (including due diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation
services, and termination of pre-existing relationships computed based on the
fair value of the assets acquired), lease termination fees and other similar
costs.

Changes in gains on sales of properties are related to
property sales which totaled 39, 73 and 24 for the years ended December 31,
2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.  We recognized impairment losses on certain held-for-sale
properties in prior years as the fair value less estimated costs to sell
exceeded our carrying values. Please refer to Note 5 to our consolidated
financial statements for further discussion. The following illustrates the
reclassification impact as a result of classifying the properties sold prior to
or held for sale at December 31, 2013 as discontinued operations for the
periods presented (dollars in thousands):

We
did not record any provision for loan loss or have any loan write-offs for seniors
housing triple-net investments during the year ended December 31, 2011. During
the year ended December 31, 2012, we wrote off one loan totaling $27,008,000,
which was attributable to a loan related to an entrance fee community.  During
the year ended December 31, 2013, we wrote off one loan totaling $2,110,000,
which was attributable to one loan related to an active adult community.  The
provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for
the allowance for loan losses and is discussed in “Critical Accounting
Policies” and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

A
portion of our seniors housing triple-net properties were formed through
partnerships. Income from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net
income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. Net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share
of net income or loss relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling
partner.

Fluctuations in revenues and property operating
expenses are primarily a result of acquisitions subsequent to January 1, 2011.
Interest income relates to the Sunrise loan funded during the three months
ended

December 31, 2012 and acquired in January 2013 (please
refer to Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional
information).

The fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are
due to the net impact of acquisitions and variations in amortization of
short-lived intangible assets. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of
additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly.
Loss from unconsolidated entities

during the year
ended December 31, 2013

is primarily attributable to depreciation and
amortization of short-lived intangible assets related to our joint ventures
with Chartwell and Sunrise described in Note 7 to our consolidated financial
statements.

Interest expense represents secured debt interest expense as
well as interest expense related to our $250,000,000 Canadian-denominated
unsecured term loan and our £550,000,000 Sterling-denominated senior unsecured
notes due 2028. Please refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial

In connection with secured debt extinguishments, we recognized
gains of $979,000, $2,697,000, and $3,332,000 during the years ended December
31, 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively.  The increase in gains on debt
extinguishment is primarily attributable to the increased volume of
extinguishments.

Derivative gains relate to foreign currency forward
exchange contracts entered into in conjunction with international investments
made during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively.  Please
refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further
discussion.

Transaction
costs represent costs incurred with property acquisitions (including due
diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation services, and termination of
pre-existing relationships computed based on the fair value of the assets
acquired), lease termination fees and other similar costs.  The increase in
transaction costs relates to the increased number of acquisitions during the
year ended December 31, 2013.  The majority of our seniors housing operating properties
are formed through partnership interests. Net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income or loss
related to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

The
increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new
properties and the conversion of newly constructed medical facility properties from
which we receive rent. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators
that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index.  These escalators
are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is
recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  If
the Consumer Price Index does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not
continue to increase.  Sales of real property would offset revenue increases
and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions, could result in decreased
revenues.  Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting
in an increase or decrease in rental income.

For the three months
ended December 31, 2013, our consolidated medical office building portfolio
signed 74,027 square feet of new leases and 144,436 square feet of
renewals.  The weighted-average term of these leases was five years, with
a rate of $22.45 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission
costs of $15.04 per square foot.  Substantially all of these leases during
the referenced quarter contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent
structure ranging from the change in CPI to 4%.

For
the three months ended December 31, 2013, there were no lease renewals and no
leases with a rental rate increaser in our hospital portfolio. The increase in
interest income is attributable to higher real estate loans receivable.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, we completed seven medical office building
construction projects representing $127,363,000 or $278 per square foot. The
following is a summary of medical office building construction projects pending
as of

In
connection with secured debt extinguishments, we recognized gains of $483,000
during the year ended December 31, 2012.  During the year ended December 31,
2013, we did not recognize gain or loss, as the debt extinguishments related to
contractual debt maturities.

The
increases in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily
attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of new medical facilities
for which we incur certain property operating expenses offset by discontinued
operations.

Transaction
costs represent costs incurred with property acquisitions (including due
diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation services, and termination of
pre-existing relationships computed based on the fair value of the assets
acquired) and other similar costs.  The fluctuations in transaction costs are
primarily due to acquisition volume fluctuations in the relevant years.

During
the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $2,010,000 of provision for loan
losses, which is primarily attributable to the write-off of a hospital loan.

Income
from unconsolidated entities includes our share of net income related to our
joint venture investment with Forest City Enterprises and certain
unconsolidated property investments related to our strategic joint venture
relationship with a national medical office building company.  See Note 7 to
our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Changes
in gains/losses on sales of properties is related to property sales which
totaled three, 20 and 24 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013,
respectively.  We recognized impairment losses on certain held for sale
properties in prior years as the fair value less estimated costs to sell
exceeded our carrying values.  Please refer to Note 5 to our consolidated
financial statements for further discussion. The following illustrates the
reclassification impact as a result of classifying the properties sold prior to
or held for sale at December 31, 2013 as discontinued operations for the
periods presented (dollars in thousands):

The
change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of
issuances and extinguishments, excluding our $250,000,000 Canadian-denominated
unsecured term loan and our £550,000,000 Sterling-denominated senior unsecured
notes due 2028, both of which are in our seniors housing operating segment. 
Please refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional
information.  We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for
the construction of properties owned directly by us. The amount capitalized is
based upon the balances outstanding during the construction period using the
rate of interest


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

that approximates our cost of
financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized.  The
decrease in capitalized interest is due to both a decrease in construction
fundings and a decline in our weighted-average cost of financing.  Please see
Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our
interest rate swap agreements and their impact on interest expense.  Loan
expense represents the amortization of deferred loan costs incurred in
connection with the issuance and amendments of debt. Loan expense changes are
due to amortization of charges for costs incurred in connection with senior
unsecured note issuances.  The change in interest expense on the unsecured line
of credit arrangements is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws,
paydowns and variable interest rate changes.  Please refer to Note 9 of our
consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unsecured
line of credit arrangements.

General and administrative expenses
as a percentage of consolidated revenues (including revenues from discontinued
operations) for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were 3.74%, 5.12%
and 5.37%, respectively.  The increase in general and administrative expenses
is primarily related to costs associated with our initiatives to attract and
retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives.  The decline
in percent of revenue is primarily related to the increasing revenue base as a
result of our acquisitions.  The loss on extinguishment of debt is due to the
redemption of convertible senior notes.  Please see Note 13 to our consolidated
financial statements for additional information.  The changes in preferred stock
dividends and redemption charge are primarily attributable to the net effect of
issuances, redemptions and conversions.  Please see Note 13 to our consolidated
financial statements for additional information.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We
believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate
earnings measurement. However, we consider FFO to be a useful supplemental
measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real
estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of
real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the
provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically
risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts
have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies
that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as
a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes
historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means
net income attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment
of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.

Net operating income
from continuing operations (“NOI”) is used to evaluate the operating
performance of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including
tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses.  Property operating
expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing
tenants for our seniors housing operating and medical facility properties.  These
expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and
benefits, property management fees, marketing, housekeeping, food service,
maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance.  General and
administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations or
transaction costs.  These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and
benefits, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate
fixed assets.  Same store cash NOI (“SSCNOI”) is used to evaluate the
cash-based operating performance of our properties under a consistent
population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio.  As
used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating
properties in the portfolio for the full three year reporting period.  Any
properties acquired, developed, transitioned or classified in discontinued
operations during that period are excluded from the same store amounts.  We
believe NOI and SSCNOI provide investors relevant and useful information
because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the
property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSCNOI to make decisions
about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our
properties.

EBITDA stands for
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that
EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities,
is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information
to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. We primarily utilize
EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided
by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA
divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include total interest, secured debt
principal amortization and preferred dividends.

A covenant in our primary
unsecured line of credit arrangement and Canadian denominated term loan contains
a financial ratio based on a definition of EBITDA that is specific to that
agreement. Failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of
default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability
of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Due to
the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we have
disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA as defined above and
adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses and
gain/loss on extinguishment of debt. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our
adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents Adjusted EBITDA divided
by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. Fixed charges include total
interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses),
secured debt principal

amortization and preferred
dividends. Our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of at
least 1.50 times.

Other
than Adjusted EBITDA, our supplemental reporting measures and similarly
entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt
analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and
investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial
measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical
operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these
measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. Adjusted
EBITDA is used solely to determine our compliance with a financial covenant in
our primary line of credit arrangement and Canadian denominated term loan and
is not being presented for use by investors for any other purpose. None of our
supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating
activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be
considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the
supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly
entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other
companies.

The table below reflects the
reconciliation of FFO to net income attributable to common stockholders, the
most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented. The
provisions for depreciation and amortization include provisions for
depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations. Noncontrolling

Health Care Industry

The
demand for health care services, and consequently health care properties, is
projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future. The Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) projects that national health
expenditures will rise to approximately $3.3 trillion in 2015 or 18.4% of gross
domestic product (“GDP”). The average annual growth in national health
expenditures for 2012 through 2022 is expected to be 5.8%.

While demographics are
the primary driver of demand, economic conditions and availability of services
contribute to health care service utilization rates. We believe the health care
property market may be less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns
relative to other property sectors. Investor interest in the market remains
strong, especially in specific sectors such as private-pay senior living and
medical office buildings.

The total U.S.
population is projected to increase by 13.4% through 2033. The elderly
population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 68.3% through 2033. The
elderly are an important component of health care utilization, especially
independent living services, assisted living services, skilled nursing services,
inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care. Most
health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a
hospital, a physician’s office or a seniors housing community. Therefore, we
believe there will be continued demand for companies, such as ours, with
expertise in health care real estate.


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

Health
care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health
care services increases.  We recognize the need for health care real estate as
it correlates to health care service demand.  Health care providers require
real estate to house their businesses and expand their services.  We believe
that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be
present due to:

·

The specialized nature of the industry, which enhances the
credibility and experience of our company;

·

The projected population growth combined with stable or increasing
health care utilization rates, which ensures demand; and

·

The on-going merger and acquisition activity.

Health Reform Laws

On March 23, 2010,
President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
of 2010 (the “PPACA”) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of
2010, which amends the PPACA (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”). The
Health Reform Laws contain various provisions that may directly impact us or
the operators and tenants of our properties. Some provisions of the Health
Reform Laws may have a positive impact on our operators’ or tenants’ revenues,
by, for example, increasing coverage of uninsured individuals, while others may
have a negative impact on the reimbursement of our operators or tenants by, for
example, altering the market basket adjustments for certain types of health
care facilities. The Health Reform Laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse
penalty provisions that could apply to our operators and tenants, in the event
of one or more violations of the federal health care regulatory laws. In
addition, there are provisions that impact the health coverage that we and our
operators and tenants provide to our respective employees.  The Health Reform
Laws also provide additional Medicaid funding to allow states to carry out the
expansion of Medicaid coverage to certain financially−eligible
individuals beginning in 2014, and have also permitted states to expand their
Medicaid coverage to these individuals since April 1, 2010, if certain
conditions are met.  On June 28, 2012, The United States Supreme Court upheld
the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated the
expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion will allow States not
to participate in the expansion – and to forego funding for the Medicaid
expansion – without losing their existing Medicaid funding. Given that the
federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear
how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as of
mid-December 2013, almost half of the states have made statements or otherwise
indicated that they do not intend to expand Medicaid coverage at this time. 
The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual
effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but could
also further strain state budgets. While the federal government will pay for
approximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states will be
expected to pay for part of those additional costs beginning in 2017.

We cannot predict
whether the existing Health Reform Laws, or future health care reform
legislation or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our
operators’ or tenants’ property or business. If the operations, cash flows or
financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted
by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may
be adversely affected as well.

Impact to Reimbursement
of the Operators and Tenants of Our Properties.

The
Health Reform Laws provide for various changes to the reimbursement that our
operators and tenants may receive. One such change is a reduction to the market
basket adjustments for inpatient acute hospitals, long−term care
hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, home health agencies,
psychiatric hospitals, hospice care and outpatient hospitals.  Since 2012, the
otherwise applicable percentage increase to the market basket for inpatient
acute hospitals has decreased.  Since 2012, inpatient acute hospitals have also
faced a downward adjustment of the annual percentage increase to the market
basket rate by a “productivity adjustment.” The productivity adjustment may
cause the annual percentage increase to be less than zero, which would mean
that inpatient acute hospitals could face payment rates for a fiscal year that
are less than the payment rates for the preceding year.

A similar productivity
adjustment has applied to skilled nursing facilities since 2012, which means
that the payment rates for skilled nursing facilities may decrease from one
year to the next. Long−term care hospitals have faced a specified
percentage decrease in their annual update for discharges since 2010.
Additionally, since 2012, long-term care hospitals have been subject to the
productivity adjustments, which may decrease the federal payment rates for
long-term care hospitals. Similar productivity adjustments to payment rates
have applied to inpatient rehabilitation facilities since 2012, inpatient
psychiatric hospitals since 2013 and outpatient hospitals since 2012.

The Health Reform Laws
revise other reimbursement provisions that may affect our business. For
example, the Health Reform Laws reduce states’ Medicaid disproportionate share
hospital (“DSH”) allotments, starting in 2014 through 2020. On September 18,
2013, CMS published a final rule that sets forth the annual reductions for
Medicaid DSH payments for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, which were mandated by
the Health Reform Laws, based on the assumption that the number of uninsured
people will fall sharply beginning in 2014.  Although the Health Reform Laws
mandated reductions in Medicaid DSH spending from 2014 through 2020, the final
rule addresses only DSH reductions for 2014 and 2015.  In the final rule, CMS
explained that, while the President’s FY 2014


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

budget
proposed to delay these reductions until 2015, the Department of Health and
Human Services has no flexibility to institute a delay without congressional
action. These allotments would have provided additional funding for DSH
hospitals that are operators or tenants of our properties, and thus, any
reduction might negatively impact these operators or tenants.

Additionally, under the
Health Reform Laws, beginning in fiscal year 2015, Medicare payments will
decrease to hospitals for treatment associated with hospital acquired
conditions. This decreased payment rate may negatively impact our operators or
tenants. To account for excess readmissions, the Health Reform Laws also call
for a reduction of 1% in payments for those hospitals with higher-than-average
risk-adjusted readmission rates beginning October 1, 2012, 2% beginning in
fiscal year 2014, and 3% from fiscal year 2015 onward. These reductions in
payments to our operators or tenants may affect their ability to make payments
to us.

The Health Reform Laws
additionally call for the creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board
(the “Board”), which will be responsible for establishing payment policies,
including recommendations in the event that Medicare costs exceed a certain
threshold. Proposals for recommendations submitted by the Board prior to
December 31, 2018 may not include recommendations that would reduce payments
for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and physicians, among other
providers, prior to December 31, 2019.  Pursuant to statute, the Board’s first
set of recommendations were due on January 15, 2014.  However, the President
has yet to nominate anyone to serve on the Board, and the fiscal year 2014
omnibus appropriations bill rescinds $10 million of funding from the Board.

The Health Reform Laws
also create other mechanisms that could permit significant changes to payment.
For example, the Health Reform Laws establish the Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Innovation to test innovative payment and service delivery models to
reduce program expenditures through the use of demonstration programs that can
waive existing reimbursement methodologies. As another example, on November 2,
2011, CMS published the final rule implementing section 3022 of the Health
Reform Laws, which contains provisions relating to Medicare payment to
providers and suppliers participating in Accountable Care Organizations
(“ACOs”) under the Medicare Shared Servings Program. Under the program,
Medicare will share a percentage of savings with ACOs that meet certain quality
and saving requirements, thereby allowing providers to receive incentive
payments in addition to their traditional fee−for−service payments.
Under the program, more experienced providers may assume the risk of losses in
exchange for greater potential rewards: ACOs may share up to 50% of the savings
under the one−sided model and up to 60% of the savings under the
two−sided model, depending on their quality and performance. The amount
of shared losses for which an ACO is liable in the two−sided model may
not exceed the following percentages of its updated benchmark: 5% in the first
performance year, 7.5% in the second year, and 10% in the third year. These
shared losses could affect the ability of ACO operators or tenants to meet
their financial obligations to us.

Additionally, although
the Health Reform Laws delayed implementation of the Resource Utilization
Group, Version Four (“RUG−IV”), which revises the payment classification
system for skilled nursing facilities, the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act
of 2010 repealed this delay retroactively to October 1, 2010. The
implementation of the RUG-IV classification may impact our tenants and
operators by revising the classifications of certain patients. The federal
reimbursement for certain facilities, such as skilled nursing facilities,
incorporates adjustments to account for facility case-mix. The Health Reform
Laws also extend certain payment rules related to long−term acute care
hospitals found in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007
(“MMSEA”). The MMSEA delayed the implementation of a policy referred to as the
“25% threshold rule” that would limit the proportion of patients who can be
admitted from a co-located or host hospital during a cost reporting period and
be paid under the long-term care hospital prospective payment system.  The
Health Reform Laws further extended the delay, which expired at various points
in calendar year 2012, depending on the start of the provider’s cost reporting
period.  The Long Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment Final Rule for fiscal
year 2013 extended the delay for an additional year.  However, in the fiscal
year 2014 final rule for the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System, CMS
finalized its proposal to let expire the one-year extension of the existing
moratorium on the 25% threshold policy.  The expiration of the moratorium on
the 25% threshold policy impacts cost reporting periods that began on or after
October 1, 2013.

Finally, many other
changes resulting from the Health Reform Laws, or implementing regulations or
guidance, may negatively impact our operators and tenants. We will continue to
monitor and evaluate the Health Reform Laws and implementing regulations and
guidance to determine other potential effects of the reform.

Impact of Fraud and
Abuse Provisions.

The Health Reform Laws revise health care fraud and abuse
provisions that will affect our operators and tenants. Specifically, the Health
Reform Laws allow for up to treble damages under the Federal False Claims Act
for violations related to state−based health insurance exchanges
authorized by the Health Reform Laws, which will be implemented beginning in
2014. The Health Reform Laws also impose new civil monetary penalties for false
statements or actions that lead to delayed inspections, with penalties of up to
$15,000 per day for failure to grant timely access and up to $50,000 for a
knowing violation. Additionally, the Health Reform Laws require certain
entities – including providers, suppliers, Medicaid managed care


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

organizations, Medicare Advantage organizations, and
prescription drug program sponsors – to report and return overpayments to the
appropriate payer by the later of (a) sixty (60) days after the date the
overpayment was “identified,” or (b) the date that the “corresponding cost
report” is due. The entity also must notify the payer in writing of the reason
for the overpayment. A violation of these requirements may result in criminal
liability, civil liability under the FCA, and/or exclusion from the federal
health care programs. On February 14, 2012, CMS published a proposed rule
implementing the Health Reform Laws requirement that health care providers and
suppliers report and return self−identified overpayments by the later of
60 days after the date the overpayment was identified, or the date any
corresponding cost report is due, if applicable; however, as early January
2014, the rule has yet to be finalized. The Health Reform Laws also amend the
Federal Anti−Kickback Statute (“AKS”) to state that any items or services
“resulting from” a violation of the AKS constitute a “false or fraudulent
claim” under the Federal False Claims Act. The Health Reform Laws also provide
for additional funding to investigate and prosecute health care fraud and
abuse. Accordingly, the increased penalties under the Health Reform Laws for
fraud and abuse violations may have a negative impact on our operators and
tenants in the event that the government brings an enforcement action or
subjects them to penalties.

Further, CMS published
final rulemaking to implement the enhanced provider and supplier screening
provisions called for in the Health Reform Laws. Under the final rule, as of
March 25, 2011, all enrolling and participating providers and suppliers are
assessed an annual administrative fee and are placed in one of three risk
levels (limited, moderate, and high) based on an assessment of the individual’s
or entity’s overall risk of fraud, waste and abuse. This rule also allows for
the temporary suspension of Medicare payments to providers or suppliers in the
event CMS receives credible information that an overpayment, fraud, or willful
misrepresentation has occurred. The Health Reform Laws granted the Secretary of
the Department of Health and Human Services significant discretionary authority
to suspend, exclude, or impose fines on providers and suppliers based on the
agency’s determination that such a provider or supplier is “high−risk,”
and, as a result, this final rulemaking has the potential to materially
adversely affect our operators and tenants who may be evaluated under the
enhanced screening process.

On November 2, 2011,
CMS and OIG jointly published the final rule establishing waivers of certain
fraud and abuse laws to ACOs. These waivers include automatic AKS, Stark, and
Civil Monetary Penalty Law waivers that may be applied in certain situations
and that will apply uniformly to each ACO, ACO participant, and ACO
provider/supplier. Notably, the final rule states that CMS and OIG intend to
closely monitor ACOs through June 2013 to ensure that these waivers are not
causing “undesirable effects” and do not need to be narrowed to prevent fraud
and abuse. As of early January 2014, the results of this monitoring effort have
not been made publicly available.

Additionally,
provisions of Title VI of the Health Care Reform Laws are designed to increase
transparency and program integrity by skilled nursing facilities, other nursing
facilities and similar providers. Specifically, skilled nursing facilities and
other providers and suppliers will be required to institute compliance and
ethics programs. Additionally, the Health Reform Laws make it easier for
consumers to file complaints against nursing homes by mandating that states
establish complaint websites. The provisions calling for enhanced transparency
will increase the administrative burden and costs on these providers.

Impact to the Health
Care Plans Offered to Our Employees.

The Health Reform Laws affect
employers that provide health plans to their employees. The laws change the tax
treatment of the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy and extend dependent
coverage for dependents up to age 26, among other changes. We continue to
evaluate our health care plans for these changes as new reform laws are
enacted. These changes may affect our operators and tenants as well.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make
estimates and assumptions.  Management considers accounting estimates or
assumptions critical if:

·

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the
levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain
matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and

·

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition
or operating performance is material.

Management has discussed the
development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
disclosure presented below relating to them.  Management believes the current
assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our
consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely
to change in the future.  However, since these estimates require assumptions to
be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the
risk of change.  If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other
considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated
financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial
condition.  Please refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial
statements for further information on significant accounting policies that
impact us. There were no material changes to these policies in 2013.

The following table presents
information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material
assumptions used to develop each estimate:

Nature of Critical

Accounting Estimate

Assumptions/Approach

Used

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial
  statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned
  subsidiaries and the accounts of joint venture entities in which we own a
  majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no
  substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights have been
  granted to the noncontrolling interests.  In addition, we consolidate those
  entities deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we are
  determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany
  transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

We
  make judgments about which entities are VIEs based on an assessment of
  whether (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a
  controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is
  insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional
  subordinated financial support. We

make
  judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and
  whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration
  of various factors includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the
  activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance,
  our form of ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing
  body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of
  other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the
  manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly
  assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our
  involvement or on a continuous basis when determining the primary beneficiary
  of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated
  financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date
  other than at inception of the variable interest entity, our assumptions may
  be different and may result in the identification of a different primary
  beneficiary.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of
  preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management
  judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements.

Our determinations are
  based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact
  on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments to income tax expense may
  be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal and state
  tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a REIT, (iii) the
  potential for built-in-gain recognized related to prior-tax-free acquisitions
  of C corporations, and (iv) changes in tax laws. Adjustments required in
  any given period are included in income.

Operations

Accounting Estimate

Business Combinations

Real property developed by
  us is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of construction period
  interest. The cost of real property acquired is allocated to net tangible and
  identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair values.
  Tangible assets primarily consist of land, buildings and improvements. The
  remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable intangible assets
  primarily consisting of the above or below market component of in-place
  leases and the value of in-place leases. The total amount of other intangible
  assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer
  relationship values based on management’s evaluation of the specific
  characteristics of each tenant’s lease and the Company’s overall relationship
  with that respective tenant.

We make estimates as part
  of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various
  components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each
  component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically
  the allocation of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and in-place
  leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of
  value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these
  components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record
  over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining
  lease term. In the case of the value of in-place leases, we make our best
  estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each
  tenant's lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during
  hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to
  execute similar leases. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue
  that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired
  in-place leases.

We compute depreciation
  and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on
  their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40 years for
  buildings and five to 15 years for improvements. Amortization periods for
  intangibles are based on the estimated remaining useful lives of the
  underlying agreements.

Allowance for Loan Losses

We maintain an allowance
  for loan losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The allowance for loan losses
  is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our
  loans receivable.  The determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly
  evaluation of all outstanding loans.  If this evaluation indicates that there
  is a greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on
  non-accrual status may be required.  A loan is impaired when, based on
  current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to
  collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of
  the original loan agreement.  Consistent with this definition, all loans on
  non-accrual are deemed impaired.  To the extent circumstances improve and the
  risk of collectability is diminished, we will return these loans to full
  accrual status.

The determination of the
  allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans,
  including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan
  payments and principal. We evaluate the collectability of our loans
  receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to,
  delinquency status, historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the
  borrower and guarantors and value of the underlying property.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

The valuation of derivative instruments is accounted for in
  accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires companies to record derivatives at
  fair market value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities.

The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make
  estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair
  values of our forward exchange contracts are estimated using pricing models
  that consider forward currency spot rates, forward trade rates and discount
  rates.  Fair values of our interest rate swaps are estimated by utilizing
  pricing models that consider forward yield curves, discount rates and
  counterparty credit risk. Such amounts and their recognition are subject to
  significant estimates which may change in the future.

Operations

Assumptions/Approach

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recorded in
  accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires that revenue be recognized after
  four basic criteria are met. These four criteria include persuasive evidence
  of an arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and determinable income
  and reasonably assured collectability. If the collectability of revenue is
  determined incorrectly, the amount and timing of our reported revenue could
  be significantly affected. Interest income on loans is recognized as earned
  based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of
  collectability risk. Substantially all of our operating leases contain fixed
  and/or contingent escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental
  escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial
  lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related
  to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on
  the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  We recognize
  resident fees and services, other than move-in fees, monthly as services are
  provided.  Lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year
  and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days’ notice.

We evaluate the
  collectability of our revenues and related receivables on an on-going basis.
  We evaluate collectability based on assumptions and other considerations
  including, but not limited to, the certainty of payment, payment history, the
  financial strength of the investment’s underlying operations as measured by
  cash flows and payment coverages, the value of the underlying collateral and
  guaranties and current economic conditions.

If our evaluation
  indicates that collectability is not reasonably assured, we may place an
  investment on non-accrual or reserve against all or a portion of current
  income as an offset to revenue.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review our long-lived
  assets for potential impairment in accordance with U.S. GAAP. An impairment
  charge must be recognized when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is
  not recoverable.  The carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum
  of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual
  disposition of the asset.  If it is determined that a permanent impairment of
  a long-lived asset has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced
  to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference
  between the carrying value and the fair value.

The net book value of
  long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to
  determine if there are indicators of impairment.  These indicators may
  include anticipated operating losses at the property level, the tenant’s
  inability to make rent payments, a decision to dispose of an asset before the
  end of its estimated useful life and changes in the market that may
  permanently reduce the value of the property.  If indicators of impairment
  exist, then the undiscounted future cash flows from the most likely use of
  the property are compared to the current net book value.  This analysis
  requires us to determine if indicators of impairment exist and to estimate
  the most likely stream of cash flows to be generated from the property during
  the period the property is expected to be held.

Impact of Inflation

During
the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings
because of the moderate inflation rate. Additionally, our earnings are
primarily long-term investments with predictable rates of return. These
investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured
notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured line of credit
arrangement. During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by
rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because
the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing
costs. Presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term
interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not
impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.


Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

We are exposed to
various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes
in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We seek to mitigate the

underlying
foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts
hedging these exposures.

We seek to mitigate the
effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new
investments with new long-term fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible. We
may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest
rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on our policy to match our
variable rate investments with comparable borrowings, but are also based on the
general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of
the future volatility of interest rates. This section is presented to provide a
discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

We historically
borrow on our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement to acquire,
construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties.
Then, as market conditions dictate, we will issue equity or long-term fixed
rate debt to repay the borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangements. 
We are subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that
existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing
may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness. The majority of
our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that
limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. Accordingly, in the event that
we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these
limitations, our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited.

A change in
interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed
rate debt. Interest rate changes, however, will affect the fair value of our
fixed rate debt. Changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this
fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings,
depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt, variable
rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets. To illustrate the impact
of changes in the interest rate markets, we performed a sensitivity analysis on
our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present
values arising from a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates to determine
the instruments’ change in fair value. The following table summarizes the
analysis performed as of the dates indicated (in thousands):

Our variable rate debt, including our unsecured
line of credit arrangements, is reflected at fair value. At December 31, 2013,
we had $1,089,362,000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt. Assuming
no changes in outstanding balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would
result in increased annual interest expense of $10,893,620. At December 31,
2012, we had $527,060,000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt.
Assuming no changes in outstanding balances, a 1% increase in interest rates
would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of $5,271,000.

We are subject to currency fluctuations that
may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and results of
operations. Increases or decreases in the value of the Canadian Dollar or
Pounds Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar impacts the amount of net income we
earn from our investments in Canada and the United Kingdom. Based solely on our
results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, if these exchange rates
were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, our net income from these
investments would decrease or increase, as applicable, by less than $500,000 for
the twelve-month period.  We seek to mitigate these underlying foreign currency
exposures with non-U.S. denominated borrowings and gains and losses on
derivative contracts hedging these exposures.  If we increase our international
presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors
housing and health care properties outside the United States, we may also
decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than
the U.S. Dollar, Canadian Dollars or Pounds Sterling. To illustrate the impact
of changes in foreign currency markets, we performed a sensitivity analysis on
our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values
arising from a hypothetical 1% increase in foreign currency exchange rates to
determine the instruments’ change in fair value.  The following table

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Health Care REIT, Inc. as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of
comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedules listed in Item 15(a)(2) of this Form 10-K. These financial
statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Health Care REIT, Inc. at December
31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

We have also audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Health Care REIT, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February
21, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Business

Health Care REIT, Inc., an S&P
500 company with headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, is an equity real estate
investment trust (“REIT”) that invests in seniors housing and health care real
estate. Our full service platform offers property management and development
services to our customers. As of December 31, 2013, our diversified portfolio
consisted of 1,199 properties in 46 states, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
Founded in 1970, we were the first real estate investment trust to invest
exclusively in health care facilities.

2. Accounting Policies and Related Matters

Principles of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control, through voting rights
or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.

At
inception of joint venture transactions, we identify entities for which control
is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities”
or “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary
of its operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either
(i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling
financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient
to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial
support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the
primary beneficiary.  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810,

Consolidations

(“ASC 810”), requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to
determining whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated on a continuous
basis. This evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and
influence the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that entity’s
economic performance.

For
investments in joint ventures, we evaluate the type of rights held by the
limited partner(s), which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which
the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership.
The assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption
of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be
made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed
if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the
rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or
decreases its ownership in the limited partnership, or (iii) there is an
increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership
interests. We similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited
liability companies.

Use of Estimates

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue
is recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires that revenue be
recognized after four basic criteria are met. These four criteria include
persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and
determinable income and reasonably assured collectability. Interest income on
loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding
subject to an evaluation of collectability risk. Substantially all of our
operating leases contain escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual
rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the
initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income
related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based
on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  Leases in our
medical office building portfolio typically include some form of operating
expense reimbursement by the tenant.  Certain payments made to operators are
treated as lease incentives and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the
lease term.  We recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in fees,
monthly as services are provided.  Lease agreements with residents generally
have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days’
notice.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less.

Restricted Cash

Restricted
cash primarily consists of amounts held by lenders to provide future payments
for real estate taxes, insurance, tenant and capital improvements and amounts
held in escrow relating to acquisitions we are entitled to receive over a
period of time as outlined in the escrow agreement.

Deferred Loan Expenses


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Deferred loan expenses are costs
incurred by us in connection with the issuance, assumption and amendments of
debt arrangements. We amortize these costs over the term of the debt using the
straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

Investments
in less than majority owned entities are reported under the equity method of
accounting when our interests represent either (1) general partnership
interests subject to substantive participating or kick-out rights that have
been granted to the limited partners, or (2) limited partnership interests with
no control over major operating and financial policies of the entities. Under
the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee’s earnings or losses
is included in our consolidated results of operations. To the extent that our
cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level, the basis
difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and
liabilities, and such amortization is included in our share of equity in
earnings of the entity.  The initial carrying value of investments in
unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity
interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of
interests in the entity. Other equity investments include an investment in
available-for-sale securities. These equity investments represented a minimal
ownership interest in these companies. We evaluate our equity method
investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value
of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When we determine a decline
in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is
other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Certain
noncontrolling interests are redeemable at fair value.  Accordingly, we record
the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests at the greater of (i) the
initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling
interest’s share of net income or loss and its share of other comprehensive
income or loss and dividends or (ii) the redemption value.  In accordance with
ASC 810, the redeemable noncontrolling interests were classified outside of
permanent equity, as a mezzanine item, in the balance sheet.

Real
Property Owned

Real
property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of
construction period interest. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred.  Property acquisitions are accounted for as business
combinations where we measure the assets acquired, liabilities (including
assumed debt and contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests at their fair
values on the acquisition date.  The cost of real property acquired, which
represents substantially all of the purchase price, is allocated to net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair
values. These properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40 years for buildings and 5
to 15 years for improvements. Tangible assets primarily consist of land,
buildings and improvements, including those related to capital leases.  We
consider costs incurred in conjunction with re-leasing properties, including
tenant improvements and lease commissions, to represent the acquisition of
productive assets and, accordingly, such costs are reflected as investment
activities in our statement of cash flows.

The
remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable intangible assets
primarily consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases
and the value associated with the presence of in-place tenants or residents. 
The value allocable to the above or below market component of the acquired
in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate
which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference
between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over
its remaining term, and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that
would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The
amounts allocated to above market leases are included in acquired lease
intangibles and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the
balance sheet and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of
the respective leases.

The
total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to
in-place lease values and customer relationship values for in-place tenants
based on management’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each
tenant’s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant.
Characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the
nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant,
growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant’s
credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors

.  The
total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to
in-place lease values for in-place residents with such value representing (i)
value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating
costs that would be incurred in an assumed re-leasing period, and (ii) value
associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during an assumed
re-leasing period.  This intangible asset will be amortized over the assumed
re-leasing period.

The net book
value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property
basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be
impaired or that the depreciable life may need to be changed. We consider
external factors relating to each asset and the existence of a master lease
which may link the cash flows of an individual asset to a larger portfolio of
assets leased to the same tenant. If these factors and the projected
undiscounted cash flows of the asset over the remaining


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

depreciation period indicate that the asset will not
be recoverable, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair market
value.

In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating
investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health
care industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect
the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or
on terms acceptable to us.

Capitalization of Construction Period Interest

We
capitalize interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of
properties owned directly by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the
balance outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest
which approximates our cost of financing. We capitalize interest costs related
to construction of real property owned by us. Our interest expense reflected in
the consolidated statements of comprehensive income has been reduced by the
amounts capitalized.

Gain on Sale of Assets

We
recognize sales of assets only upon the closing of the transaction with the
purchaser. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as
deposits and classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Gains on assets sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing
when (i) the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, (ii) we
are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the
profit, (iii) we have received adequate initial investment from the purchaser and
(iv) other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may be
deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain
recognition on sales of real estate.

Real Estate Loans Receivable

Real
estate loans receivable consist of mortgage loans and other real estate loans.
Interest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount
outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectability risks. The loans are
primarily collateralized by a first, second or third mortgage lien, a leasehold
mortgage on, or an assignment of the partnership interest in, the related
properties, corporate guaranties and/or personal guaranties.

Allowance for Losses on Loans Receivable

The
allowance for losses on loans receivable is maintained at a level believed
adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The determination
of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of these loans, including
general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We
evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a combination of
factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, historical loan
charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors and value of the
underlying collateral. If such factors indicate that there is greater risk of
loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be
required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it
is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled
according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Consistent
with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. To the
extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we
will return these loans to full accrual status. While a loan is on non-accrual
status, any cash receipts are applied against the outstanding principal
balance.

Goodwill

We account
for goodwill in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds
the reporting unit’s fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill is less
than the carrying amount of that goodwill.  We have not had any goodwill
impairments.

Fair Value of Derivative
Instruments

Derivatives
are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities.  The
valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the fair value of the instruments.  Fair values of our derivatives
are estimated by pricing models that consider the forward yield curves and
discount rates.  The fair value of our forward exchange contracts are estimated
by pricing models that consider foreign currency spot rates, forward trade
rates and discount rates.  Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts are
subject to significant estimates that may change in the future. See Note 11
for additional information.

Federal Income Tax

We
have elected to be treated as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our
first taxable year, and made no provision for federal income tax purposes prior
to our acquisition of our “taxable REIT subsidiaries.” As a result of these as
well as subsequent acquisitions, we now record income tax expense or benefit
with respect to certain of our entities that are taxed as taxable REIT
subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular
corporations and not under the REIT provisions.


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and
liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets
and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the
year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any increase or decrease
in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and
that causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of
events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Deferred
income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more
likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from
a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about the
realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in the tax
provision when such changes occur.  See Note 18 for additional
information.

Foreign Currency

Certain of our
subsidiaries’ functional currencies are the local currencies of their
respective countries. We translate the results of operations of our foreign
subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange in effect during
the period, and we translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in
effect at the end of the period. We record resulting currency translation
adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
stockholders’ equity, on our consolidated balance sheets. We record transaction
gains and losses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Earnings
Per Share

Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the
period adjusted for non-vested shares of restricted stock. The computation of
diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that
the number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common
shares had been issued.

New
Accounting Standards

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-02, “Comprehensive Income (Topic
220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income,” which requires companies to provide information about the amounts that
are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and
by the respective line items of net income.  The amendment to authoritative
guidance associated with comprehensive income was effective for us on January 1,
2013.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications

Certain
amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year
presentation.

3. Real Property Acquisitions and Development

The total purchase price
for all properties acquired has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable
intangible assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests based upon their
respective fair values in accordance with our accounting policies.

The results of operations for these acquisitions have been
included in our consolidated results of operations since the date of
acquisition and are a component of the appropriate segments.  Transaction costs
primarily represent costs incurred with property acquisitions, including due
diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation services and termination of
pre-existing relationships computed based on the fair value of the assets
acquired, lease termination fees and other acquisition-related costs.  During
the year ended December 31, 2013, we

finalized our purchase price
allocation of certain previously reported acquisitions and there were no
material changes from those previously disclosed.

Note 18.  This structure results in the inclusion of all resident revenues and
related property operating expenses from the operation of these qualified
health care properties in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
Certain of our subsidiaries’ functional currencies are the local currencies of
their respective countries. See Note 2 for information regarding our foreign
currency policies.

Revera Acquisition

On May 28, 2013, we completed the formation of our
partnership (the “Revera Partnership”) with Revera Inc. to own and operate a
portfolio of 47 seniors housing properties in Canada.  We own a 75% partnership
interest and Revera Inc. owns the remaining 25% interest and manages the
facilities.  The results of operations for the Revera Partnership have been
included in our consolidated results of operations beginning on May 28, 2013
and are a component of our seniors housing operating segment.  Consolidation is
based on a combination of ownership interest and control of operational
decision-making authority.  The total purchase price of $1,318,168,000 for the
47 properties acquired has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable
intangible assets and liabilities based upon their respective fair values in
accordance with the Company’s accounting policies.  Such allocations have not
been finalized as we are reviewing final asset valuations with our partner,
and, as such, the allocation of the purchase consideration included in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013 is preliminary
and subject to adjustment.

Sunrise
Merger

In August 2012, we entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Sunrise Senior Living, Inc.
(“Sunrise”), pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Sunrise in an all-cash merger
(the “Merger”) in which Sunrise stockholders would receive $14.50 in cash for
each share of Sunrise common stock. On January 9, 2013, we completed our

acquisition of the Sunrise property portfolio

.  The Sunrise Merger advances our strategic vision to own
higher-end, private pay properties located in major metropolitan markets.  On
July 1, 2013, we acquired the remaining interests in 49 previously
unconsolidated properties.  As of December 31, 2013, 120 properties are wholly
owned and five properties are held in unconsolidated entities (see Note 7 for
additional information).  The total purchase price of approximately
$4,155,052,000, including approximately $2,456,011,000 of cash consideration,
has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and
liabilities in the table above based on respective fair values in accordance
with our accounting policies.

We recognized $654,717,000, $22,930,000 and $0 of
revenues and $216,827,000, $11,698,000 and $0 of net operating income from
continuing operations related to the consolidated Sunrise portfolio during the
twelve month periods ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  In
addition, we incurred $77,187,000 of transaction costs, which include advisory
fees, due diligence

7. Investments
in Unconsolidated Entities

During the year ended December 31,
2010, we entered into a joint venture investment with Forest City Enterprises
(NYSE:FCE.A and FCE.B). We acquired a 49% interest in a seven-building life
science campus located at University Park in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is
immediately adjacent to the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.

During the year ended December 31,
2012, we entered into a joint venture with Chartwell Retirement Residences
(TSX:CSH.UN). The portfolio contains 42 properties in Canada, 39 of which are
owned 50% by us and Chartwell, and three of which we wholly own. All properties
are managed by Chartwell. The 39 properties are accounted for under the equity
method of accounting and do not qualify as VIEs (variable interest entities).
The joint venture is structured under RIDEA. See Note 18 for additional
information.  The aggregate remaining unamortized basis difference of our
investment in this joint venture of $9,063,000 at December 31, 2013 is
primarily attributable to transaction costs that will be amortized over the
weighted-average useful life of the related properties and included in the
reported amount of income from unconsolidated entities.

In conjunction with the Sunrise Merger, we acquired joint
venture interests in 54 properties and a 20% interest in a newly formed Sunrise
management company, which manages the entire property portfolio. On July 1,
2013, we acquired the remaining interests in 49 of the properties. Our original
investment of $49,759,000 relating to the five remaining unconsolidated
properties and the management company is recorded as an investment in
unconsolidated entities on the balance sheet.

The results of operations for these
properties have been included in our consolidated results of operations from
the date of acquisition by the joint ventures and are reflected in our
statements of comprehensive income as income or loss from unconsolidated
entities.  Summarized combined financial information for our investments in

9. Borrowings
Under Line of Credit Arrangement and Related Items

At
December 31, 2013, we had a $2,250,000,000 unsecured line of credit arrangement
with a consortium of 30 banks. We have an option to upsize the facility by up
to an additional $1,000,000,000 through an accordion feature, allowing for the
aggregate commitment of up to $3,250,000,000.  The arrangement also allows us
to borrow up to $500,000,000 in certain alternative currencies.  At December
31, 2013, we had $130,000,000 outstanding at 1.34%.  The revolving credit
facility is scheduled to expire March 31, 2017, but can be extended for an
additional year at our option.     Borrowings under the revolver are subject to
interest payable in periods

no
longer than three months

at
either the agent bank’s prime rate of interest or the applicable margin over
LIBOR interest rate, at our option (1.34% at December 31, 2013). The applicable
margin is based on certain of our debt ratings and was 1.175% at December 31,
2013. In addition, we pay a facility fee annually to each bank based on the
bank’s commitment amount. The facility fee depends on certain of our debt ratings
and was 0.225% at December 31, 2013.  Principal is due upon expiration of the
agreement.

10. Senior
Unsecured Notes and Secured Debt

We may
repurchase, redeem or refinance convertible and non-convertible senior
unsecured notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market
conditions when available. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open
market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some
cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their
terms.   The non-convertible senior unsecured notes are redeemable at our
option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price
equal to the sum of (1) the principal amount of the notes (or portion of
such notes) being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to the
redemption date and (2) any “make-whole” amount due under the terms of the
notes in connection with early redemptions.   Redemptions and repurchases of
debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity
requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.  At December 31, 2013,
the annual principal payments due on these debt obligations were as follows (in
thousands):

During the twelve
months ended December 31, 2010, we issued $494,403,000 of 3.00% senior
unsecured convertible notes due December 2029, generating net proceeds of
$486,084,000. The notes are convertible, in certain circumstances, into cash
and, if applicable, shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate of
19.5064 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an
initial conversion price of $51.27 per share. In general, upon conversion, the
holder of each note would receive, in respect of the conversion value of such
note, cash up to the principal amount of such note and common stock for the
note’s conversion value in excess of such principal amount. In addition, on
each of December 1, 2014, December 1, 2019 and December 1, 2024,
holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be
purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The notes are bifurcated into
a debt component and an equity component since they may be settled in cash upon
conversion. The value of the debt component is based upon the estimated fair
value of a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature at the time
of issuance. The difference between the contractual principal on the debt and
the value allocated to the debt of $29,925,000 was recorded as an equity
component and represents the conversion feature of the instrument. The excess
of the contractual principal amount of the debt over its estimated fair value
is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the
period used to estimate the fair value.  During the year ended December 31,
2013, we received notice of conversion from holders of $219,295,000 of the
senior unsecured convertible notes.  These notes were converted into
988,007 shares of common stock and we recognized a loss on extinguishment of
$2,423,000, which is reflected on the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income.

Our debt agreements
contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Certain
agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net
worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens
and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2013, we were in
compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements.

11.
Derivative Instruments

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising
from adverse changes in interest rates. We may elect to use financial
derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. These decisions are
principally based on our policy to manage the general trend in interest rates
at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest
rates.  In addition, non-U.S. investments expose us to the potential losses
associated with adverse changes in foreign currency to U.S. Dollar exchange rates. 
We have elected to manage these risks through the use of forward exchange
contracts and issuing debt in the foreign currency.

I

nterest
Rate Swap Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

For instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”), and reclassified into earnings
in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings.  Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness
or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are
recognized in earnings.  Approximately $1,890,000 of losses, which are included
in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), are expected to be
reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.

Foreign
Currency Hedges

For instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the
variability in the foreign currency to U.S. dollar of the instrument is
recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment component of OCI.  The
balance of the cumulative translation adjustment will be reclassified to
earnings when the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.

On February 15, 2012, we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase
$250,000,000 Canadian Dollars at a fixed rate in the future.  The forward
contract was used to limit exposure to fluctuations in the Canadian Dollar to
U.S. Dollar exchange rate associated with our initial cash investment funded
for the Chartwell transaction.  On May 3, 2012, this forward exchange
contract was settled for a gain of $2,772,000, which was reflected on the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and the proceeds were used to
fund our investment.  On May 3, 2012, we also entered into a forward contract
to sell $250,000,000 Canadian Dollars at a fixed rate on July 31, 2012 to hedge
our net investment. We settled the forward contract on July 31, 2012 with the
net loss reflected in OCI. Upon settlement of the forward contract we entered
into a $250,000,000 Canadian Dollar term loan, which has been designated as a
net investment hedge of our Chartwell investment, and changes in fair value are
reported in OCI as no ineffectiveness is anticipated.

On August 30, 2012, we entered into two cross currency swaps to purchase
£125,000,000.  The swaps were used to limit exposure to fluctuations in
the Pound Sterling to U.S. Dollar exchange rate associated with our initial
cash investment funded for the Sunrise transaction. The cross currency swaps
have been designated as a net investment hedge, and changes in fair value are
reported in OCI as no ineffectiveness is anticipated.

On September 17, 2012, we entered into two forward exchange contracts to
purchase $14,000,000 Canadian Dollars and £23,000,000 at a fixed rate in the
future.  The forward contracts were used to limit exposure to fluctuations
in foreign currency

associated with future
international transactions.  These forward contacts were settled on March 22,
2013 for a realized loss of $2,309,000, which was reflected on the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income.

On
January 14, 2013 and January 15, 2013, we entered into three forward exchange
contracts to sell £675,000,000 at a fixed rate in the future.  The forward
exchange contracts were used to hedge a portion of our investment in the United
Kingdom at a fixed Pound Sterling rate in U.S. dollars and were settled on July
12, 2013. We received proceeds of $63,514,000.  The forward exchange contracts
were designated as net investment hedges and the change in fair value is
reported in OCI.

On April 4, 2013,
we entered into three forward exchange contracts to purchase $600,000,000
Canadian Dollars at a fixed rate in the future and three forward exchange
contracts to sell $600,000,000 Canadian Dollars at a fixed rate in the future.
The forward contracts were used to limit exposure to fluctuations in the
Canadian Dollar to U.S. Dollar exchange rate associated with our initial cash
investment funded for an acquisition in Canada. On May 22, 2013, the three
forward exchange purchase contracts were settled for a realized loss of
$10,355,000, which was reflected on the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, and the proceeds were used to fund our investment. On May 22, 2013, we
designated the three forward exchange sell contracts as net investment hedges,
and changes in fair value are reported in OCI as no ineffectiveness is
anticipated. Prior to designating the three forward exchange sell contracts as
net investments, they were marked to fair value and an unrealized gain of
$13,071,000 was reflected on the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income.  In December 2013, the three forward exchange sell contracts were
settled with the net gain reflected in OCI, and we entered into three new
forward exchange sell contracts to sell $600,000,000 Canadian Dollars at a
fixed rate in the future.  These new forward exchange contracts were designated
as net investment hedges, and changes in fair value are reported in OCI as no
ineffectiveness is anticipated.

On
July 1, 2013, we entered into two forward exchange contracts to purchase
£144,411,000 at a fixed rate in the future. The forward contracts were used to
limit exposure to fluctuations in the Pound Sterling to U.S. Dollar exchange
rate associated with our initial cash investment for an acquisition in the
United Kingdom. In July 2013, these forward contracts were settled for a
realized loss of $4,872,000, which was reflected on the consolidated statement
of comprehensive income, and the proceeds were used to fund our investment.

On
July 12, 2013, we entered into three forward exchange contracts to sell
£675,000,000 at a fixed rate in the future.  The forward exchange
contracts were used to hedge a portion of our investment in the United Kingdom
at a fixed Pound Sterling rate in U.S. dollars and mature on December 31,
2013.  The forward exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges
and changes in fair value are reported in OCI as no ineffectiveness was
expected.  In November 2013, we sold £550,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
the Company’s 4.800% senior notes due 2028.  In conjunction with this
transaction, we settled the three forward exchange sell contracts with the net
loss reflected in OCI.  Upon settlement of the forward exchange sell contracts,
we entered into one new forward exchange contract to sell £225,000,000 at a
fixed rate in the future. The new forward exchange contract and the
£550,000,000 senior notes were designated as a net investment hedge of our
investment in the United Kingdom, and changes in the fair value of the forward
exchange sell contracts and senior notes are reported in OCI as no
ineffectiveness is anticipated.

12. Commitments and Contingencies

At
December 31, 2013, we had five outstanding letter of credit obligations totaling
$5,103,000 and expiring between 2013 and 2014.  At December 31, 2013, we had
outstanding construction in process of $141,085,000 for leased properties and
were committed to providing additional funds of approximately $243,083,000 to
complete construction. At December 31, 2013, we had contingent purchase
obligations totaling $65,217,000. These contingent purchase obligations relate
to unfunded capital improvement obligations and contingent obligations on
acquisitions. Rents due from the tenant are increased to reflect the additional
investment in the property.

We
evaluate our leases for operating versus capital lease treatment in accordance
with ASC Topic 840 “Leases.”  A lease is classified as a capital lease if
it provides for transfer of ownership of the leased asset at the end of the
lease term, contains a bargain purchase option, has a lease term greater than
75% of the economic life of the leased asset, or if the net present value of
the future minimum lease payments are in excess of 90% of the fair value of the
leased asset. Certain leases contain bargain purchase options and have been
classified as capital leases.  At December 31, 2013, we had operating lease
obligations of $881,694,000 relating to certain ground leases and Company
office space. Regarding the ground leases, we have sublease agreements with
certain of our operators that require the operators to reimburse us for our
monthly operating lease obligations. At December 31, 2013, aggregate future
minimum rentals to be received under these noncancelable subleases totaled
$44,106,000.

At December 31, 2013, future minimum
lease payments due under operating and capital leases are as follows (in

Other
Equity

.  Other equity consists of accumulated option compensation expense,
which represents the amount of amortized compensation costs related to stock
options awarded to employees and directors. Expense, which is recognized as the
options vest based on the market value at the date of the award, totaled $1,114,000,
$2,875,000 and $1,917,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,

14. Stock Incentive Plans

Our
Amended and Restated 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizes up to 6,200,000
shares of common stock to be issued at the discretion of the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors. The 2005 Plan replaced the 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The options granted
to officers and key employees under the 1995 Plan vested through 2010 and
expire ten years from the date of grant. Our non-employee directors, officers
and key employees are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan
allows for the issuance of, among other things, stock options, restricted
stock, deferred stock units and dividend equivalent rights.  Under our long
term incentive plan, certain restricted stock awards are performance based. 
Compensation expense for these performance grants is measured based on the probability
of achievement of certain objective and subjective performance goals and is
recognized over both the performance period and vesting period.  If the
estimated number of performance

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

based restricted
stock to be earned changes, an adjustment will be recorded to recognize the
accumulated difference between the revised and previous estimates.  Vesting
periods for options, deferred stock units and restricted shares generally range
from three years for non-employee directors to five years for officers and key
employees. Options expire ten years from the date of grant.

Valuation Assumptions

The
fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions:

were no options granted for the year ended December 31, 2013.  The dividend
yield represented the dividend yield of our common stock on the dates of grant.
Our computation of expected volatility was based on historical volatility. The
risk-free interest rates used were the 7-year U.S. Treasury Notes yield on the
date of grant. The expected life was based on historical experience of similar
awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and
expectations regarding future employee behavior.

16. Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate
the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate that value.

Mortgage Loans and Other Real Estate Loans Receivable

— The fair value of mortgage loans and other real estate
loans receivable is generally estimated by using level two and level three
inputs such as discounting the estimated future cash flows using the current
rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit
ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The carrying amount approximates fair value.

Available-for-sale Equity Investments

— Available-for-sale equity investments are recorded at
their fair value based on level one publicly available trading prices.

Borrowings Under Unsecured Line of Credit Arrangements

— The carrying amount of the unsecured line of credit
arrangements approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate
adjustable.

Senior Unsecured Notes

— The fair value of the senior unsecured notes payable was estimated based on
level one publicly available trading prices.

Secured Debt

— The
fair value of fixed rate secured debt is estimated using level two inputs by
discounting the estimated future cash flows using the current rates at which
similar loans would be made with similar credit ratings and for the same
remaining maturities.  The carrying amount of variable rate secured debt
approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate adjustable.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

— Interest rate swap agreements are recorded in other
assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet at fair market value.  Fair
market value is estimated using level two inputs by utilizing pricing models that
consider forward yield curves and discount rates.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

— Foreign currency forward contracts are recorded in other
assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet at fair market value.  Fair
market value is determined using level two inputs by estimating the future
value of the currency pair based on existing exchange rates, comprised of
current spot and traded forward points, and calculating a present value of the
net amount using a discount factor based on observable traded interest rates.

U.S.
GAAP provides authoritative guidance for measuring and disclosing fair value
measurements of assets and liabilities.  The guidance defines fair value as the
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

date. 
The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity
to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value.  The guidance describes three levels of
inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 - Quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 -
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Please see Note 2
for additional information.

Level 3 -
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that
are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The market approach is utilized to measure fair value for
our financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring
basis.  The market approach uses prices and other relevant information
generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or
liabilities.

Items Measured at Fair Value
on a Nonrecurring Basis

In
addition to items that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we also
have assets and liabilities in our balance sheet that are measured at fair
value on a nonrecurring basis.  As these assets and liabilities are not
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, they are not included in the
tables above. Assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests that are
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include those acquired/assumed in
business combinations (see Note 3) and asset impairments (see Note 5 for
impairments of real property and Note 6 for impairments of loans receivable). We
have determined that the fair value measurements included in each of these
assets and liabilities rely primarily on Company-specific inputs and our assumptions
about the use of the assets and settlement of liabilities, as observable inputs
are not available. As such, we have determined that each of these fair value
measurements generally reside within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
We estimate the fair value of real estate and related intangibles using the
income approach and unobservable data such as net operating income and
estimated capitalization and discount rates.  We also consider local and
national industry market data including comparable sales, and commonly engage
an external real estate appraiser to assist us in our estimation of fair value. 
We estimate the fair value of assets held for sale based on current sales price
expectations or, in the absence of such price expectations, Level 3 inputs
described above.  We estimate the fair value of secured debt assumed in
business combinations using current interest rates at which similar borrowings
could be obtained on the transaction date.

17. Segment Reporting

We invest in seniors housing and health care real estate. We
evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our five operating segments:
seniors housing triple-net, seniors housing operating, medical office
buildings, hospitals and life science. Our seniors housing triple-net
properties include skilled nursing/post-acute facilities, assisted living
facilities, independent living/continuing care retirement communities, care
homes (United Kingdom), care homes with nursing (United Kingdom) and
combinations thereof. Under the seniors housing triple-net segment, we invest
in seniors housing and health care real estate through acquisition and
financing of primarily single tenant properties. Properties acquired are
primarily leased under triple-net leases and we are not involved in the
management of the property. Our seniors housing operating properties include the
seniors housing communities referenced above and independent supportive living
facilities (Canada) that are owned and/or operated through RIDEA structures
(see Notes 3 and 18).


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our medical facility properties include medical office
buildings, hospitals and life science buildings which are aggregated into our
medical facilities reportable segment. Our medical office buildings are
typically leased to multiple tenants and generally require a certain level of
property management. Our hospital investments are leased and we are not
involved in the management of the property. Our life science investment
represents an investment in an unconsolidated entity (see Note 7).

The accounting policies
of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies (see Note 2). The results of operations for all
acquisitions described in Note 3 are included in our consolidated results of
operations from the acquisition dates and are components of the appropriate
segments.  There are no intersegment sales or transfers.

We evaluate performance
based upon net operating income from continuing operations (“NOI”) of each
segment. We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less
property operating expenses.  We believe NOI provides investors relevant and
useful information because it measures the operating performance of our
properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to make
decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level
performance of our properties.

Non-segment revenue
consists mainly of interest income on non-real estate investments and other
income. Non-segment assets consist of corporate assets including cash, deferred
loan expenses and corporate offices and equipment among others. Non-property
specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual segments in
determining NOI

.

segments (which excludes unconsolidated entities) during the years ended

Income Taxes and Distributions

We elected
to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our first taxable year.  To qualify as a REIT
for federal income tax purposes, at least 90% of taxable income (excluding 100%
of net capital gains) must be distributed to stockholders.  REITs that do not
distribute a certain amount of current year taxable income in the current year
are also subject to a 4% federal excise tax. The main differences between net
income for federal income tax purposes and financial statement purposes are the
recognition of straight-line rent for reporting purposes, basis differences in
acquisitions, recording of impairments, differing useful lives and depreciation
and amortization methods for real property and the provision for loan losses
for reporting purposes versus bad debt expense for tax purposes.

Cash
distributions paid to common stockholders, for federal income tax purposes, are
as follows

REITs generally are
not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on that portion of REIT taxable income
or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders.  For the tax year ended
December 31, 2013, as a result of acquisitions located in Canada and the United
Kingdom in 2012 and 2013, we were subject to foreign income taxes under the
respective tax laws of these jurisdictions.  The provision for income taxes for
the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to state taxes, foreign
taxes, and taxes based on income generated by entities that are structured as
taxable REIT subsidiaries.

Management assesses the
available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future
taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.  As
required under the provisions of ASC 740, Management applied the concepts on an
entity-by-entity, jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.  With respect to the
analysis of certain entities in multiple jurisdictions, a significant piece of
objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the
three-year period ended December 31, 2013.  Such objective evidence limits the
ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future
growth.

On the basis of the
evaluations performed as required by the codification, valuation allowances
totaling $71,955,000 were recorded on U.S. taxable REIT subsidiaries as well as
entities in other jurisdictions to limit the deferred tax assets to the amount
that Management believes is more likely that not realizable.  However, the
amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if (i)
estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced
or increased or (ii) objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative
losses is no longer present (and additional weight may be given to subjective
evidence such as our projections for growth).

The valuation allowance
rollforward is summarized as follows for the periods presented (dollars in
thousands):

As a result of certain acquisitions, we are subject to
corporate level taxes for any related asset dispositions that may occur during
the ten-year period immediately after such assets were owned by a C corporation
(“built-in gains tax”). The amount of income potentially subject to this
special corporate level tax is generally equal to the lesser of (a) the excess
of the fair value of the asset over its adjusted tax basis as of the date it
became a REIT asset, or (b) the actual amount of gain. Some but not all gains
recognized during this period of time could be offset by available net
operating losses and capital loss carryforwards.  During the year ended December
31, 2013, we acquired certain additional assets with built-in gains as of the
date of acquisition that could be subject to the built-in gains tax if disposed
of prior to the expiration of the applicable ten-year period.  We have not
recorded a deferred tax liability as a result of the potential built-in gains
tax based on our intentions with respect to such properties and available tax
planning strategies.

Under the provisions of the REIT Investment
Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”), for taxable years
beginning after July 30, 2008, the REIT may lease “qualified health care properties”
on an arm’s-length basis to a TRS if the property is operated on behalf of such
subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor.”
Generally, the rent received from the TRS will meet the related party rent
exception and will be treated as “rents from real property.” A “qualified
health care property” includes real property and any personal property that is,
or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility,
assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care
facility, or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or
ancillary services to patients.  We have entered into various joint ventures
that were structured under RIDEA.  Resident level rents and related operating
expenses for these facilities are reported in the consolidated financial
statements and are subject to federal and state income taxes as the operations
of such facilities are included in a TRS.  Certain net operating loss
carryforwards could be utilized to offset taxable income in future years.

Given the applicable statute of limitations, we generally
are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the year ended
December 31, 2010 and subsequent years. The statute of limitations may vary in
the states in which we own properties or conduct business.  We do not expect to
be subject to audit by state taxing authorities for any year prior to the year
ended December 31, 2007. We are also subject to audit by the Canada Revenue
Agency and provincial authorities generally for periods subsequent to our REIT
acquisition in May 2012 related to entities acquired or formed in connection
with the acquisition, and by HM Revenue & Customs for periods subsequent to
our REIT acquisitions in August 2012 and January 2013 related to entities
acquired or formed in connection with the acquisitions.

At December 31, 2013, we had a net operating loss
(“NOL”) carryforward related to the REIT of $133,568,000.  Due to our
uncertainty regarding the realization of certain deferred tax assets, we have
not recorded a deferred tax asset related to NOLs generated by the REIT.  These
amounts can be used to offset future taxable income (and/or taxable income for
prior years if an audit determines that tax is owed), if any. The REIT will be
entitled to utilize NOLs and tax credit carryforwards only to the extent that
REIT taxable income exceeds our deduction for dividends paid.  The NOL
carryforwards will expire through 2033.

At December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, we had a net
operating loss carryforward related to Canadian entities of $50,958,000 and $4,275,000. 
These Canadian losses have a 20-year carryforward period.  At December 31,
2013, we had a net operating loss carryforward related to United Kingdom
entities of $238,741,000, consisting of $232,305,000 of net operating losses
from acquisitions and $6,436,000 of net operating losses from current year
activities.  These United Kingdom losses do not have a finite carryforward
period.

We apply the rules
under ASC 740-10 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” for uncertain tax
positions using a “more likely than not” recognition threshold for tax
positions. Pursuant to these rules, we will initially recognize the financial
statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on
the technical merits of the tax position, that such a position will be
sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. If the tax benefit
meets the “more likely than not” threshold, the measurement of the tax benefit
will be based on our estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if
audited by the taxing

Of the total $6,413,000
of total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013,
$5,896,000 (exclusive of accrued interest and penalties) relates to the April
1, 2011 Genesis HealthCare Corporation transaction (“Genesis Acquisition”) and
is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet.  As a part of the Genesis Acquisition, we received a full
indemnification from FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC covering income taxes or
other taxes as well as  interest and penalties relating to tax positions taken
by FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC prior to the acquisition.  Accordingly, an
offsetting indemnification asset is recorded in receivables and other assets on
the consolidated balance sheet.  Such indemnification asset is reviewed for
collectability periodically.

There is no amount of
unrecognized tax benefits, currently accrued for, that would have a material
impact on the effective tax rate to the extent that would be recognized.  There
were insignificant uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2013 for which it
is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits would
decrease during 2014.  Interest and penalties totaled $465,000 and $1,215,000,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and are included in income tax
expense.  Of these amounts, $337,000 and $996,000 of interest and penalties,
respectively, relate to the Genesis Acquisition and are offset by the
indemnification asset.

19. Retirement Arrangements

Under
the retirement plan and trust (the “401(k) Plan”), eligible employees may make
contributions, and we may make matching contributions and a profit sharing
contribution. Our contributions to the 401(k) Plan totaled $2,562,000, $2,140,000,
and $1,558,000 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

We
have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), a non-qualified defined
benefit pension plan, which provides one executive officer with supplemental
deferred retirement benefits. The SERP provides an opportunity for the
participant to receive retirement benefits that cannot be paid under our
tax-qualified plans because of the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Benefits are based on compensation
and length of service and the SERP is unfunded. Benefit payments are expected
to total $3,069,000 during the next five fiscal years and $4,604,000
thereafter. We use a December 31 measurement date for the SERP. The accrued
liability on our balance sheet for the SERP was $6,453,000 at December 31, 2013
($6,665,000 at December 31, 2012).

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The Company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Management
has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the criteria established by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) in a report entitled Internal Control — Integrated Framework.

The
scope of management’s assessment as of December 31, 2013 did not include an
assessment of the internal control over financial reporting for the Revera
Partnership, as discussed in Note 3 to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements, because the Revera Partnership was acquired during the year ended
December 31, 2013. The acquired businesses represent 5% of total assets at
December 31, 2013 and 4% and 3% of revenues and net operating income,
respectively, for the year then ended. The scope of management’s assessment on
internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2014
will include the aforementioned acquired operations.

Based
on this assessment, using the criteria above, management concluded that the
Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of December 31, 2013.

The
independent registered public accounting firm of Ernst & Young LLP, as
auditors of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued an
attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
occurred during the fourth quarter of the one-year period covered by this
report that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.


Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors
and Shareholders of Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited
Health Care REIT, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria, 2013 framework). Health Care REIT, Inc.’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,
management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the
Revera Partnership, which is included in the 2013 consolidated financial
statements of Health Care REIT, Inc. and cumulatively constitute 5% of total
assets at December 31, 2013 and 4% and 3% of revenues and net operating income,
respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of the internal control over
financial reporting of Health Care REIT, Inc. also did not include an
evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Revera
Partnership.

In our opinion, Health
Care REIT, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Health Care
REIT, Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated
statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 and our report dated February
21, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
