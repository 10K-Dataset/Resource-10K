ANNUAL REPORT




PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a
    self-administered, equity real estate investment trust that
    invests in health care and senior housing facilities. Founded in
    1970, we were the first real estate investment trust to invest
    exclusively in health care facilities. As of December 31,
    2005, we had $2,858,429,000 of net real estate investments,
    inclusive of credit enhancements, in 442 facilities located in
    36 states and managed by 54 different operators. At that
    date, the portfolio included 195 assisted living facilities, 203
    skilled nursing facilities, 31 independent living/continuing
    care retirement communities and 13 specialty care facilities.

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and
    enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash
    dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase
    dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual
    increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To
    meet these objectives, we invest in properties managed by
    experienced operators and diversify our investment portfolio by
    operator and geographic location.

Depending on the availability and cost of external capital, we
    anticipate investing in additional facilities and entering into
    operating leases with, and loans to, qualified operators.
    Capital for future investments may be provided by borrowing
    under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements, public or
    private offerings of debt or equity securities, or the
    incurrence or assumption of secured indebtedness.

References herein to “we,” “us,”
    “our” or the “Company” refer to Health Care
    REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless specifically noted
    otherwise.

Property
    Types

Our primary property investments are skilled nursing facilities,
    assisted living facilities and independent living/continuing
    care retirement communities. We also invest in specialty care
    facilities. Our properties include stand-alone facilities that
    provide one level of service, combination facilities that
    provide multiple levels of service and communities or campuses
    that provide a wide range of services. The following is a
    summary of our various property types.



Assisted
    Living Facilities

Assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties
    that provide the same services as independent living facilities,
    but also provide supportive care from trained employees to
    residents who require assistance with activities of daily
    living, including management of medications, bathing, dressing,
    toileting, ambulating and eating.

Alzheimer’s/Dementia Care
    Facilities.

Certain assisted living facilities
    may include state licensed settings that specialize in caring
    for those afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease

and/or

similar forms of dementia.

Skilled
    Nursing Facilities

Skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental
    properties where the majority of individuals require

24-hour

nursing

and/or

medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for
    Medicaid

and/or

Medicare reimbursement.

Independent
    Living/Continuing Care Retirement Communities

These communities may include one or more of the following
    property types:

Continuing Care Retirement
    Communities.

Continuing care retirement
    communities include a combination of detached homes, an
    independent living facility, an assisted living facility

and/or

a
    skilled nursing facility on one campus. Resident payment plans
    vary, but can include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental
    fees.

Active Adult Communities.

Active adult
    communities contain primarily for-sale single-family homes,
    townhomes, cluster homes, mobile homes

and/or

condominiums with no specialized services. These communities are
    typically restricted or targeted to adults at least
    55 years of age or older. Residents generally lead an
    independent lifestyle. Communities may include amenities such as
    a clubhouse, golf course and recreational spaces.

Independent Living Facilities.

Independent
    living facilities are age-restricted multifamily properties with
    central dining facilities that provide residents access to meals
    and other services such as housekeeping, linen service,
    transportation and social and recreational activities.

Specialty
    Care Facilities

Our specialty care facilities include acute care hospitals,
    long-term acute care hospitals and other specialty care
    hospitals. Acute care hospitals provide a wide range of
    inpatient and outpatient services, including, but not limited
    to, surgery, rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories.
    Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for
    patients with complex medical conditions that require more
    intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than that
    available in most skilled nursing facilities. Other specialty
    care hospitals provide specialized inpatient and outpatient
    services for specific illnesses or diseases, including, among
    others, orthopedic, neurosurgical and behavioral care.

Investments

We invest in health care and senior housing properties. We
    diversify our investment portfolio by operator and geographic
    location. In determining whether to invest in a facility, we
    focus on the following: (1) the experience of the
    tenant’s or borrower’s management team; (2) the
    historical and projected financial and operational performance
    of the facility; (3) the credit of the tenant or borrower;
    (4) the security for the lease or loan; and (5) the
    capital committed to the facility by the tenant or borrower. We
    conduct market research and analysis for all potential
    investments. In addition, we review the value of all facilities,
    the interest rates and covenant requirements of any debt to be
    assumed and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing
    debt that is not to be assumed.

Our investments are primarily real property leased to operators
    under long-term operating leases or financed with operators
    under long-term mortgage loans. Construction financing is
    provided, but only as part of a long-term operating lease or
    mortgage loan. Substantially all of our investments are designed
    with escalating rate structures. Depending upon market
    conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in
    the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will
    generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. Operating
    leases and mortgage loans are normally credit enhanced by
    guaranties

and/or

letters of credit. Typically, operating leases are structured



as master leases and mortgage loans are cross-defaulted and
    cross-collateralized with other mortgage loans, operating leases
    or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates.

At December 31, 2005, 87% of our owned real property was
    subject to master leases. A master lease is a lease of multiple
    facilities to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement.
    From time to time, we may acquire additional facilities that are
    then leased to the tenant under the master lease. The tenant is
    required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all
    the properties that are subject to the master lease. Typically,
    the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the
    facilities or to renew the master lease only with respect to all
    leased facilities at the same time. This bundling feature
    benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or
    renewal to the better performing facilities and terminate the
    leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing
    facilities. This spreads our risk among the entire group of
    facilities within the master lease. The bundling feature may
    provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in
    bankruptcy. Subject to certain restrictions, a debtor in
    bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases.
    It is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required
    to assume or reject the master lease as a whole, rather than
    deciding on a facility by facility basis.

We monitor our investments through a variety of methods
    determined by the type of facility and operator. Our asset
    management process includes review of monthly financial
    statements and other operating data for each facility, periodic
    review of operator creditworthiness, periodic facility
    inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to
    licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other
    collateral. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a
    proprietary database to collect and analyze facility-specific
    data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain
    industry trends and risks.

Through asset management and research, we evaluate the operating
    environment in each facility’s market to determine whether
    payment risk is likely to increase. When we identify
    unacceptable levels of payment risk, we seek to mitigate,
    eliminate or transfer the risk. We categorize the risk as
    operator, facility or market risk. For operator risk, we
    typically find a substitute operator to run the facility. For
    facility risk, we usually work with the operator to institute
    facility-level management changes to address the risk. Finally,
    for market risk, we often encourage an operator to change its
    capital structure, including refinancing the facility or raising
    additional equity. Through these asset management and research
    efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to
    address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the
    collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment.

Operating
    Leases

Each facility, which includes the land, building, improvements
    and related rights, owned by us is leased to an operator
    pursuant to a long-term operating lease. As discussed above,
    most of our leased properties are subject to master leases.
    These leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to
    15 years and contain one or more five to

15-year

renewal options. Each lease is a net lease requiring the tenant
    to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation
    of the leased property. The tenants are required to repair,
    rebuild and maintain the leased properties.

The net value of our completed leased properties aggregated
    approximately $2,658,019,000 at December 31, 2005. Prior to
    June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual
    rental escalators, which were generally recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the initial lease period. Beginning in
    June 2004, our new standard lease structure contains annual
    rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the
    Consumer Price Index

and/or

changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s
    properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line
    rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. This
    lease structure initially generates lower revenues and earnings
    compared to leases with fixed escalators that require
    straight-lining, but enables us to generate additional organic
    growth and minimize non-cash straight-line rent over time. This
    change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay
    dividends.

We currently provide for the construction of facilities for
    tenants as part of long-term operating leases. We capitalize
    certain interest costs associated with funds used to pay for the
    construction of properties owned by us. The amount capitalized
    is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period
    using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of
    financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount
    capitalized. We also typically charge a transaction fee at the
    commencement of construction. The construction period commences
    upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion
    of the applicable facility or the end of a specified period.
    During the construction period, we advance funds to the operator
    in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions



which require, among other things, site visits by a Company
    representative prior to advancement of funds. During the
    construction period, we generally require an additional credit
    enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds

and/or

completion guaranties. At December 31, 2005, we had
    outstanding construction investments of $3,906,000 for leased
    properties and were committed to providing additional funds of
    approximately $36,519,000 to complete construction.

Mortgage
    Loans

Our investments in mortgage loans are typically structured to
    provide us with interest income, principal amortization and
    transaction fees and are generally secured by a first or second
    mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage. At December 31, 2005,
    the interest yield (excluding any loans on non-accrual) averaged
    approximately 9.2% per annum on our outstanding mortgage
    loan balances. Our yield on mortgage loans depends upon a number
    of factors, including the stated interest rate, average
    principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any
    interest rate adjustments. The mortgage loans outstanding at
    December 31, 2005 are generally subject to three to

20-year

terms with principal amortization schedules

and/or

balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the
    end of the term. Generally, the mortgage loans provide three to
    eight years of prepayment protection.

Working
    Capital Loans

Working capital loans are generally either unsecured or secured
    by the operator’s leasehold rights, corporate guaranties

and/or

personal guaranties. These instruments have terms generally
    ranging from three months to ten years. At December 31,
    2005, the average interest yield (excluding any loans on
    non-accrual) was approximately 10.3% per annum on our
    outstanding working capital loan balances. At December 31,
    2005, we had provided working capital loans to eight operators.
    Loans that were previously classified as subdebt investments
    have been reclassified as working capital loans.

Equity
    Investments

We had an investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P., a
    property group that specializes in the financing, through sale
    and leaseback transactions, of nursing and care homes located in
    the United Kingdom. This investment was accounted for under the
    equity method of accounting because we had the ability to
    exercise significant influence, but not control, over the
    company due to our 31% ownership interest. In October 2003, we
    sold our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P.,
    generating a net gain of $902,000.

Other equity investments, which consist of investments in
    private and public companies for which we do not have the
    ability to exercise influence, are accounted for under the cost
    method. Under the cost method of accounting, investments in
    private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value, distributions of earnings and additional
    investments. For investments in public companies that have
    readily determinable fair market values, we classify our equity
    investments as

available-for-sale

and, accordingly, record these investments at their fair market
    values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income, a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. These investments represent a minimal
    ownership interest in these companies.



Borrowing
    Policies

We utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund the purchase
    of new properties and to provide loan financing. Our debt and
    equity levels are determined by management to maintain a
    conservative credit profile. Generally, we intend to issue
    unsecured, fixed rate public debt with long-term maturities to
    approximate the maturities on our leases and loans. For
    short-term purposes, we may borrow on our unsecured lines of
    credit arrangements. We replace these borrowings with long-term
    capital such as senior unsecured notes, common stock or
    preferred stock. When terms are deemed favorable, we may invest
    in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. In
    addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged
    properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties
    acquired on a leveraged basis. It is our intent to limit secured
    indebtedness. In our agreements with our lenders, we are subject
    to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured
    indebtedness.

Competition

We compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate
    partnerships, banks, insurance companies, finance companies,
    government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds
    and other investors in the acquisition, leasing and financing of
    health care and senior housing properties. We compete for
    investments based on a number of factors including rates,
    financings offered, underwriting criterion and reputation. The
    operators of our facilities compete on a local and regional
    basis with operators of facilities that provide comparable
    services.



Operators compete for patients and residents based on a number
    of factors including quality of care, reputation, physical
    appearance of facilities, services offered, family preferences,
    physicians, staff and price.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we employed 42 full-time
    employees.

Certain
    Government Regulations

Health
    Law Matters — Generally

We invest in assisted living, skilled nursing, independent
    living/continuing care retirement communities and specialty care
    facilities, which represented approximately 34%, 44%, 15% and
    7%, respectively, of our investments at December 31, 2005.

Typically, operators of assisted living and independent living
    facilities do not receive significant funding from governmental
    programs and are regulated by the states, not the federal
    government. Operators of skilled nursing and specialty care
    facilities are subject to federal and state laws that regulate
    the type and quality of the medical

and/or

nursing care provided, ancillary services (e.g., respiratory,
    occupational, physical and infusion therapies), qualifications
    of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy
    of the physical plant and equipment, distribution of
    pharmaceuticals, reimbursement and rate setting and operating
    policies. In addition, as described below, some of our facility
    operators are subject to extensive laws and regulations
    pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including kickbacks,
    physician self-referrals and false claims.

Licensing
    and Certification

The primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities
    are the states’ licensing laws. In granting and renewing
    these licenses, the regulatory authorities consider numerous
    factors relating to a facility’s physical plant and
    operations including, but not limited to, admission and
    discharge standards and staffing and training. A decision to
    grant or renew a license is also affected by a facility’s
    record with respect to consumer rights and medication guidelines
    and rules.

Generally, our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are
    required to be licensed on an annual or bi-annual basis and to
    be certified for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs. The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any
    required license or regulatory approval or the failure to
    correct serious survey deficiencies could prevent them from
    continuing operations at a property. In addition, if a facility
    is found out of compliance with the conditions of participation
    in Medicare, Medicaid or other health care programs, the
    facility may be barred from participation in government
    reimbursement programs. Any of these occurrences may impair the
    ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us. If we
    have to replace a facility operator, our ability to replace the
    operator may be affected by federal and state rules and policies
    governing changes in control. This may result in payment delays,
    an inability to find a replacement operator, a significant
    working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other
    difficulties.

Reimbursement

Assisted Living Facilities.

Approximately 46%
    of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, were
    attributable to assisted living facilities. The majority of the
    revenues received by the operators of our assisted living
    facilities are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue
    source is primarily Medicaid waiver programs. As a part of the
    Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) of 1981,
    Congress established a waiver program under Medicaid to offer an
    alternative to institutional long-term care services. The
    provisions of OBRA and the subsequent OBRA Acts of 1987 and 1990
    allow states flexibility in developing cost-effective
    alternatives to long-term care, including assisted living and
    home health. At December 31, 2005, seven of our 23 assisted
    living operators utilized Medicaid waivers. For the
    12 months ended September 30, 2005, approximately 12%
    of the revenues at our assisted living facilities were from
    Medicaid reimbursement.

Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and
    are largely determined by local market conditions and operating
    costs. Generally, facilities receive a higher payment per day
    for a private pay resident than for a



Medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care.
    The level of Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state.
    Thus, the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living
    facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level
    and changes in Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels.
    Changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect
    on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us.

Skilled Nursing Facilities and Specialty Care
    Facilities.

Skilled nursing and specialty care
    facilities typically receive most of their revenues from
    Medicare and Medicaid, with the balance representing private
    pay, including private insurance. Consequently, changes in
    federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely
    affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses,
    including our rent or debt service. Skilled nursing and
    specialty care facilities are subject to periodic pre- and
    post-payment reviews and other audits by federal and state
    authorities. A review or audit of claims of a facility operator
    could result in recoupments, denials or delays of payments in
    the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the
    operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us. Due to
    the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor
    settlement accounting, no assurance can be given as to the
    adequacy of any reserves maintained by our facility operators
    for potential adjustments to reimbursements for payor
    settlements. Due to budgetary constraints, governmental payors
    may limit or reduce payments to skilled nursing and specialty
    care facilities. As a result of government reimbursement
    programs being subject to such budgetary pressures and
    legislative and administrative actions, an operator’s
    ability to meet its obligations to us may be significantly
    impaired.

Medicare Reimbursement and Skilled Nursing
    Facilities.

For the 12 months ended
    September 30, 2005, approximately 29% of the revenues at
    our skilled nursing facilities (which comprised 42% of our
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005) were
    from Medicare reimbursement. In an effort to reduce federal
    spending on health care, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997
    (“BBA”) fundamentally altered Medicare payment
    methodologies for skilled nursing facilities by mandating the
    institution of the skilled nursing facility prospective payment
    system. The prospective payment system caused Medicare per diem
    reimbursement for skilled nursing facility services to decrease.
    The reductions in Medicare payments resulted in immediate
    financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and caused
    a number of operators to seek bankruptcy protection. The federal
    government subsequently passed legislation to lessen the
    negative financial impact from the prospective payment system.
    These payment increases have since expired.

Skilled nursing facilities received a 3.1% inflationary market
    basket increase in Medicare payments for federal fiscal year
    2006, which represents $530 million of additional Medicare
    spending. However, aggregate Medicare expenditures in federal
    fiscal year 2006 are expected to increase by only
    $20 million because the market basket increase will be
    largely offset by the refinement of the resource utilization
    group (“RUG”) system. Effective January 1, 2006,
    the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”)
    introduced nine new payment categories, increasing the number of
    RUGs from 44 to 53. The new categories are intended to
    compensate providers for the care of medically complex patients.
    Concurrent with the RUG refinement, CMS increased the rates for
    all RUGs to reflect variations in non-therapy ancillary costs
    that were not fully captured in the RUG refinement. This
    adjustment increases aggregate Medicare payments by roughly 3%
    and represents a permanent payment increase that will be
    integrated into the base line spending levels. However, due to a
    decrease of 6% from the loss of temporary payment adjustments
    that will cease as a result of the new classification system,
    the overall increase is only 0.1%. On average, we expect
    Medicare rates in our portfolio to decrease slightly in 2006.
    The net impact varies by facility depending on geographical
    region, RUG distribution, urban versus non-urban location,
    freestanding versus hospital-based, and the operator’s
    ability to adapt to the new RUGs.

The moratorium on the therapy caps for Part B outpatient
    rehabilitation services which had applied through
    December 31, 2005 expired. The therapy caps were mandated
    by the BBA. The annual payment cap of $1,740 per patient
    applies to occupational and physical therapy and a separate
    $1,740 cap applies to speech therapy. Patients exceeding the cap
    will be able to obtain additional Medicare coverage if the
    therapy is deemed medically necessary. Otherwise, the patient
    would need to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy
    above the caps.

Medicare Reimbursement and Specialty Care
    Facilities.

For the 12 months ended
    September 30, 2005, approximately 50% of the revenues at
    our specialty care facilities (which comprised 6% of our
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005) were
    from Medicare. Specialty care facilities generally are
    reimbursed by Medicare under either the diagnosis related group
    prospective payment system reimbursement methodology for
    inpatient



hospitals, or the long-term acute care hospital prospective
    payment system for long-term acute care hospitals. Acute care
    hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient
    services including, but not limited to, surgery, rehabilitation,
    therapy and clinical laboratories. Long-term acute care
    hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex
    medical conditions that require more intensive care, monitoring
    or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing
    facilities. Some of our other specialty care facilities provide
    specialized inpatient and outpatient services for specific
    illnesses or diseases including, among others, orthopedic,
    neurosurgical and behavioral care services.

With respect to Medicare’s diagnosis related
    group/outpatient prospective payment system methodology for
    regular hospitals, reimbursement for inpatient services is on
    the basis of a fixed, prospective rate based on the principal
    diagnosis of the patient. Diagnoses are grouped into more than
    500 diagnosis related groups. In some cases, a hospital might be
    able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s
    losses exceed a threshold.

On January 19, 2006, the CMS released its proposed payment
    rule for long-term acute care hospitals (“LTACHs”) for
    fiscal year 2007, which begins on July 1, 2006. Among other
    changes, the proposed rule would eliminate the market basket
    increase and change the payment rates for outliers. CMS projects
    that the proposed rule will reduce aggregate Medicare LTACH
    payments by approximately 11% in fiscal 2007. The proposal is
    subject to a 60 day comment period. Our portfolio includes
    nine LTACHs with an investment balance of $124,668,000, which
    represents 4% of our total investment balance.

Congress has limited increases in diagnosis related groups or
    outpatient prospective payment system payments. These limited
    increases may not be sufficient to cover specialty care
    facilities’ increasing costs of providing care. Failure to
    increase reimbursement to cover increased costs, or reductions
    or freezes in payment rates, will have an adverse impact on
    operators of our specialty care facilities.

Medicaid Reimbursement.

Medicaid is a major
    payor source for residents in our skilled nursing and specialty
    care facilities. For the 12 months ended September 30,
    2005, approximately 55% of the revenues of our skilled nursing
    facilities and 23% of the revenues of our specialty care
    facilities were attributable to Medicaid payments. The federal
    government and the states share responsibility for financing
    Medicaid. The federal matching rate, known as the Federal
    Medical Assistance Percentage, varies by state based on relative
    per capita income. On average, Medicaid is the largest component
    of total state spending, representing approximately 22% of total
    state spending. The percentage of Medicaid dollars used for
    long-term care varies from state to state due in part to
    different ratios of elderly population and eligibility
    requirements. With certain federal guidelines, states have a
    wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and
    reimbursement methodology. Many states reimburse long-term care
    facilities using fixed daily rates, which are applied
    prospectively based on the historical costs incurred in
    providing patient care. Reasonable costs typically include
    allowances for staffing, administrative and general, and
    property and equipment (e.g., depreciation and fair rental).

In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of
    providing skilled nursing services. Certain states are
    attempting to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid expenditures
    by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits.
    States in which we have skilled nursing facility investments
    increased their per diem Medicaid rates roughly 3% on average
    for fiscal year 2006. None of our states reduced Medicaid rates
    across the board in fiscal year 2006, although certain
    facilities experienced reduced rates due to changes in acuity.
    In addition, nine of our states effectively froze rates in
    fiscal year 2006, which impacts profitability to the extent that
    expenses continue to rise. In addition, Medicaid rates may
    decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to
    fund budgeted expenditures.

The Medicare Part D drug benefit became effective
    January 1, 2006. The direct impact on nursing facilities is
    that residents dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid now
    receive drugs through Medicare Part D rather than through
    Medicaid. Participants began enrolling in the new Part D
    prescription drug plans on November 15, 2005. Part D
    will result in increased administrative responsibilities for
    nursing home operators because residents have the choice of
    multiple prescription drug plans. Operators may also experience
    increased expenses to the extent that patients’ drugs are
    not covered by their prescription drug plan formulary.

The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care
    facilities continue to evolve. Federal and state authorities
    have considered and may seek to implement new or modified
    reimbursement methodologies that may



negatively impact health care facility operations. The impact of
    any such change, if implemented, may result in a material
    adverse effect on our skilled nursing and specialty care
    facility operations. No assurance can be given that current
    revenue sources or levels will be maintained. Accordingly, there
    can be no assurance that payments under a government
    reimbursement program are currently or will, in the future, be
    sufficient to fully reimburse the facility operators for their
    operating and capital expenses. As a result, an operator’s
    ability to meet its obligations to us could be adversely
    impacted.

Other
    Related Laws

Skilled nursing and specialty care facilities (and assisted
    living facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to
    federal, state and local laws and regulations which govern the
    operations and financial and other arrangements that may be
    entered into by health care providers. Certain of these laws
    prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose
    of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical
    products or services reimbursable by governmental programs.
    Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary
    services and submit to the government valid and accurate
    statements for each service. Still other laws require providers
    to comply with a variety of safety, health and other
    requirements relating to the condition of the licensed facility
    and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violation of
    these laws and regulations may include, but are not limited to,
    criminal

and/or

civil
    penalties and fines and a loss of licensure and immediate
    termination of governmental payments. In certain circumstances,
    violation of these rules (such as those prohibiting abusive and
    fraudulent behavior) with respect to one facility may subject
    other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions,
    including disqualification from participation in the Medicare
    and Medicaid programs. In the ordinary course of its business, a
    facility operator is regularly subjected to inquiries,
    investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that
    oversee these laws and regulations.

Each skilled nursing and specialty care facility (and any
    assisted living facility that receives Medicaid payments) is
    subject to the federal anti-kickback statute that generally
    prohibits persons from offering, providing, soliciting or
    receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an
    individual or the furnishing of a good or service, for which
    payment may be made under a federal health care program such as
    the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Skilled nursing and
    specialty care facilities are also subject to the federal Ethics
    in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the
    Stark Law. The Stark Law generally prohibits the submission of
    claims to Medicare for payment if the claim results from a
    physician referral for certain designated services and the
    physician has a financial relationship with the health service
    provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a
    financial relationship under the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions
    on physician self-referrals and submission of claims apply to
    state Medicaid programs. Further, skilled nursing and specialty
    care facilities (and assisted living facilities that receive
    Medicaid payments) are subject to substantial financial
    penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the False
    Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the False Claims
    Act’s “whistleblower” provisions. Private
    enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part
    to amendments to the False Claims Act that encourage private
    individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These
    whistleblower suits by private individuals, known as qui tam
    actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and
    former patients, nurses and other employees. Prosecutions,
    investigations or qui tam actions could have a material adverse
    effect on a facility operator’s liquidity, financial
    condition and results of operations which could adversely affect
    the ability of the operator to meet its obligations to us.
    Finally, various state false claim and anti-kickback laws also
    may apply to each facility operator. Violation of any of the
    foregoing statutes can result in criminal

and/or

civil
    penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the
    ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
    which became effective January 1, 1997, greatly expanded
    the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and
    broadened its scope to include private health care plans in
    addition to government payors. It also greatly increased funding
    for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation
    and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of
    Health and Human Services to audit, investigate and prosecute
    suspected health care fraud.

Additionally, the administrative simplification provisions of
    this law provide for communication of health information through
    standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and
    security of health information. In order to comply with the
    regulations, health care providers must undergo significant
    operational and technical changes.



Finally, government investigation and enforcement of health care
    laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and
    is expected to continue. Some of these enforcement actions
    represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application
    of false claims laws. The costs for an operator of a health care
    facility associated with both defending such enforcement actions
    and the undertakings in settlement agreements can be substantial
    and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an
    operator to meet its obligations to us.

The following summary of the taxation of the Company and the
    material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and
    equity securities is for general information only and is not tax
    advice. This summary does not address all aspects of taxation
    that may be relevant to certain types of holders of stock or
    securities (including, but not limited to, insurance companies,
    tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
    persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging,
    integrated conversion or constructive sale transaction or a

    income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax
    consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal
    income tax law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal
    income tax law, including changes in law or differing
    interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have
    a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax
    consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our
    securities as set forth in this summary. Before you purchase our
    securities, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding
    the particular U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and
    other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our
    securities.

General

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (or
    “REIT”) commencing with our first taxable year. We
    intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as
    a REIT, but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain
    qualified as a REIT for subsequent years. Qualification and
    taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety of
    qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with
    respect to income, assets, distribution level and diversity of
    share ownership as discussed below under
    “— Qualification as a REIT.” There can be no
    assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate
    in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified.

In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general, we will
    not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT
    taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to
    stockholders. We may, however, be subject to tax at normal
    corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not
    distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net
    long-term capital gain, stockholders are required to include
    their proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital
    gain in income, but they will receive a refundable credit for
    their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain.

Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to federal income
    and excise tax as follows:

•

To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital
    gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our
    “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject
    to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax
    rates;

•

We may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on
    certain items of tax preference to the extent that this tax
    exceeds our regular tax;

•

If we have net income from the sale or other disposition of
    “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale
    to customers in the ordinary course of business or other
    non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be
    subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on this income;



•

Any net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in
    general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily
    for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other
    than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of
    property due to an involuntary conversion) will be subject to a
    100% tax;

•

If we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95% gross income tests
    (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our qualification
    as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be
    subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross
    income attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross
    income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes
    of the 75% gross income test (discussed below) or (ii) 95%
    of our gross income (90% of our gross income for taxable years
    beginning on or before October 22, 2004) over the
    amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% gross
    income test (discussed below) multiplied by (2) a fraction
    intended to reflect our profitability;

•

If we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of
    (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year,
    (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year
    (other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on)
    and (3) any undistributed taxable income from preceding
    periods, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of
    such required distribution over amounts actually
    distributed; and

•

We will also be subject to a tax of 100% on the amount of any
    rents from real property, deductions or excess interest paid to
    us by any of our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” that
    would be reduced through reallocation under certain federal
    income tax principles in order to more clearly reflect income of
    the taxable REIT subsidiary. See “— Qualification
    as a REIT — Investments in Taxable REIT
    Subsidiaries.”

If we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been
    a “C” corporation in a carryover basis transaction, we
    could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited
    from the “C” corporation. A “C” corporation
    is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay
    full corporate level federal income tax. If we recognize gain on
    the disposition of the assets during the ten-year period
    beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us,
    then to the extent of the assets’ “built-in gain”
    (i.e., the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the
    adjusted tax basis in the asset, in each case determined as of
    the beginning of the ten-year period), we will be subject to tax
    on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable.
    The results described in this paragraph with respect to the
    recognition of built-in gain assume that the built-in gain
    assets, at the time the built-in gain assets were subject to a
    conversion transaction (either where a “C” corporation
    elected REIT status or a REIT acquired the assets from a
    “C” corporation), were not treated as sold to an
    unrelated party and gain recognized.

Qualification
    as a REIT

A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or association:

(1)

which is managed by one or more trustees or directors;

(2)

the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable
    shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;

(3)

which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the
    federal income tax law relating to REITs;

(4)

which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance
    company;

(5)

the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons
    in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first taxable
    year;

(6)

not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is
    owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding its
    first taxable year, directly or indirectly, by or for five or
    fewer individuals (which includes certain entities) (the
    “Five or Fewer Requirement”); and

(7)

which meets certain income and asset tests described below.

Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the
    entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at
    least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or
    during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than
    12 months. For purposes of conditions (5) and (6),
    pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated
    as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception
    in the case of condition (6).



Based on publicly available information, we believe we have
    satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in
    (5) and (6) above. In addition, Article VI of our
    Amended and Restated By-Laws provides for restrictions regarding
    ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are
    intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share
    ownership requirements described in (5) and (6) above.
    These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all
    cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements
    described in (5) and (6) above.

We have complied with, and will continue to comply with,
    regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our
    stockholders requesting information regarding the actual
    ownership of our stock. If despite sending the annual letters,
    we do not know, or after exercising reasonable diligence would
    not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer
    Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer
    Requirement. If we fail to comply with these regulatory rules,
    we will be subject to a monetary penalty. If our failure to
    comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement, the
    penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply
    were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty
    would be imposed.

We may own a number of properties through wholly owned
    subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified
    REIT subsidiary” if 100% of its stock is owned by a REIT
    and the REIT does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable
    REIT subsidiary. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” will
    not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets,
    liabilities and items of income, deductions and credits of a
    “qualified REIT subsidiary” will be treated as assets,
    liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT. A
    “qualified REIT subsidiary” is not subject to federal
    income tax, and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified
    REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against
    ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more
    than 10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or
    more than 5% of the value of our total assets, as described
    below under “— Asset Tests.”

If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability company or a
    trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will
    be deemed to own a proportionate share of the
    partnership’s, limited liability company’s or
    trust’s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving
    our share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited
    liability company or trust, and the gross income will retain the
    same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the
    partnership, limited liability company or trust. These
    “look-through” rules apply for purposes of the income
    tests and assets tests described below.

Income Tests.

There are two separate
    percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we
    must satisfy for each taxable year.

•

At least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
    directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from
    “rents from real property,” other income from
    investments relating to real property or mortgages on real
    property or certain income from qualified temporary investments.

•

At least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
    directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the
    sources qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from
    dividends (including dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries)
    and interest.

For taxable years beginning on or before October 22, 2004,
    (1) payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap
    agreement, option, futures contract, forward rate agreement or
    any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce
    interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred
    and (2) gain from the sale or other disposition of any such
    investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95% gross
    income test. As to transactions entered into in taxable years
    beginning after October 22, 2004, any of our income from a
    “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is
    entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or
    indirectly, to manage the risk of interest rate movements, price
    changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or
    obligations incurred or to be incurred by us, or such other
    risks that are prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is
    excluded from the 95% gross income test. In general, a hedging
    transaction is “clearly identified” if (1) the
    transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the
    end of the day on which it is entered into and (2) the
    items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially
    contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction. An
    identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is
    made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging
    transaction.



Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real
    property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests
    for a REIT only if several conditions are met:

•

The amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the
    income or profits of any person, although rents generally will
    not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed
    percentage or percentages of receipts or sales.

•

Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real
    property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT,
    also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant,
    unless the tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain
    other requirements are met with respect to the real property
    being rented.

•

If rent attributable to personal property leased in connection
    with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total
    rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent
    attributable to such personal property will not qualify as
    “rents from real property.”

•

For rents to qualify as rents from real property, we generally
    must not furnish or render services to tenants, other than
    through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an “independent
    contractor” from whom we derive no income, except that we
    may directly provide services that are “usually or
    customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the
    property is located in connection with the rental of real
    property for occupancy only, or are not otherwise considered
    “rendered to the occupant for his convenience.”

For taxable years beginning after August 5, 1997, a REIT
    has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of
    impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts
    received with respect to that property as rent from real
    property. The amount received or accrued by the REIT during the
    taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a
    property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by
    the REIT directly or indirectly from the property. The amount
    received for any service or management operation for this
    purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150% of the direct
    cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or
    providing the management or operation. Furthermore,
    impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable
    REIT subsidiary subject to certain conditions, and we may still
    treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from
    real property.

The term “interest” generally does not include any
    amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in
    part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount
    generally will not be excluded from the term
    “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed
    percentage of receipts or sales.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income
    tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a
    REIT for such year if we are eligible for relief. For taxable
    years beginning on or before October 22, 2004, these relief
    provisions generally will be available if (1) our failure
    to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to
    willful neglect; (2) we attach a schedule of the sources of
    our income to our return; and (3) any incorrect information
    on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax.
    For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, these
    relief provisions generally will be available if
    (1) following our identification of the failure, we file a
    schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross
    income and (2) the failure to meet such tests was due to
    reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.

It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under
    which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
    provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is
    imposed on an amount equal to (a) the gross income
    attributable to (1) 75% of our gross income over the amount
    of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% income test
    and (2) 95% of our gross income (90% of our gross income
    for taxable years beginning on or before October 22,
    2004) over the amount of qualifying gross income for
    purposes of the 95% income test, multiplied by (b) a
    fraction intended to reflect our profitability.

Asset Tests.

Within 30 days after the
    close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy
    several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our
    assets determined in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. At least 75% of the value of our total
    assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash
    items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of
    our operation), government securities and qualified temporary
    investments. Although the remaining 25% of our assets generally
    may be invested without restriction, we are prohibited from
    owning securities representing more than 10% of either the vote
    (the “10% vote



test”) or value (the “10% value test”) of the
    outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified REIT
    subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Further,
    no more than 20% of the total assets may be represented by
    securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (the
    “20% asset test”) and no more than 5% of the value of
    our total assets may be represented by securities of any
    non-governmental issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary
    (the “5% asset test”), another REIT or a taxable REIT
    subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test and
    the 20% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each
    quarter. There are special rules which provide relief if the
    value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the
    value of the assets of a REIT.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000,
    certain items are excluded from the 10% value test, including
    (1) straight debt securities of an issuer (including
    straight debt that provides certain contingent payments);
    (2) any loan to an individual or an estate; (3) any
    rental agreement described in Section 467 of the Internal
    Revenue Code, other than with a “related person”;
    (4) any obligation to pay rents from real property;
    (5) certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision
    thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, or any
    political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto
    Rico; (6) any security issued by a REIT; and (7) any
    other arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary of the
    Treasury, is excepted from the definition of security
    (“excluded securities”). Special rules apply to
    straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities
    taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If a
    REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds (1) straight
    debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and
    (2) securities of such issuer that are not excluded
    securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1% of such
    issuer’s outstanding securities, the straight debt
    securities will be included in the 10% value test.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, a
    REIT’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not
    treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value
    test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt
    instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for
    purposes of applying the 10% value test (1) to the extent
    of the REIT’s interest as a partner in the partnership and
    (2) if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income
    (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would
    qualify for the 75% gross income test. For taxable years
    beginning after October 22, 2004, for purposes of the 10%
    value test, a REIT’s interest in a partnership’s
    assets is the REIT’s proportionate interest in any
    securities issued by the partnership (other than the excluded
    securities described in the preceding paragraph).

With respect to corrections of failures for which the
    requirements for corrections are satisfied after
    October 22, 2004, regardless of whether such failures
    occurred in taxable years beginning on, before or after such
    date, as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test
    or the 5% asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a
    REIT by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that
    does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT’s assets at
    the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided that
    the disposition occurs within six months following the last day
    of the quarter in which the REIT first identified the assets.
    For violations of any of the REIT asset tests due to reasonable
    cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds
    described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid
    disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter
    by taking certain steps, including disposition of sufficient
    assets within the six month period described above to meet the
    applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to the greater of
    $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net
    income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period
    of time that the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and
    filing a schedule with the Internal Revenue Service that
    describes the non-qualifying assets.

Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.

For
    taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, REITs may
    own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in
    taxable REIT subsidiaries. We and any taxable corporate entity
    in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to
    treat such entity as a “taxable REIT subsidiary.”

Several of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a
    taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject
    to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but
    are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that
    cannot be performed directly by REITs without jeopardizing their
    REIT status. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries will attempt to
    minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can be no
    assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to
    minimize taxes will be successful. To the extent our taxable
    REIT subsidiaries are required to pay federal, state or local
    taxes, the cash available for distribution as dividends to us
    from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced.



The amount of interest on related-party debt that a taxable REIT
    subsidiary may deduct is limited. Further, a 100% tax applies to
    any interest payments by a taxable REIT subsidiary to its
    affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate is not
    commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT subsidiary is permitted
    to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of
    these restrictions.

The Internal Revenue Service may reallocate costs between a REIT
    and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is a lack of
    arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any deductible
    expenses allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would
    increase its tax liability. Further, any amount by which a REIT
    understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable
    REIT subsidiary will, subject to certain exceptions, be subject
    to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may
    be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an
    interest.

Annual Distribution Requirements.

In order to
    avoid being taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to
    make distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to
    our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction
    in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of (i) 90%
    of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard
    to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and
    (ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from
    foreclosure property, minus (2) a portion of certain items
    of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid in the
    taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable
    year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that
    year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution
    payment after such declaration. The amount distributed must not
    be preferential. This means that every stockholder of the class
    of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the
    same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of
    stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its
    dividend rights as a class. To the extent that we do not
    distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least
    90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,”
    as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed
    amount at regular corporate tax rates. Finally, as discussed
    above, we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet
    certain other distribution requirements. We intend to make
    timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual
    distribution requirements.

It is possible that, from time to time, we may not have
    sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%
    distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount
    as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to,
    among other things, (1) timing differences between
    (i) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of
    deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and
    deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or
    (2) the payment of severance benefits that may not be
    deductible to us. In the event that timing differences occur, we
    may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or, if possible,
    pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to
    meet the distribution requirement.

Under certain circumstances, in the event of a deficiency
    determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be able to
    rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement
    for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to
    stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our
    deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year. Thus, we
    may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as
    deficiency distributions; however, we will be required to pay
    applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any
    deduction taken for deficiency distributions.

Failure
    to Qualify as a REIT

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable
    year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any
    applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at
    regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any
    year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be
    deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be
    required to be made in any year. All distributions to
    stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of
    current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these
    distributions and, subject to certain limitations, will be
    eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate
    stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory
    provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT
    for the four taxable years following the year during which
    qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in
    all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief.
    Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to
    incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay
    potentially significant resulting tax liabilities.



In addition to the relief described above under
    “— Income Tests” and
    ‘‘— Asset Tests,” relief is available
    in the event that we violate a provision of the Internal Revenue
    Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if
    (1) the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to
    willful neglect, (2) we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each
    failure to satisfy the provision, and (3) the violation
    does not include a violation described under
    “— Income Tests” or “— Asset
    Tests” above. It is not now possible to determine the
    circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of
    these relief provisions.

Federal
    Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock

Treatment of Taxable
    U.S. Stockholders.

The following summary
    applies to you only if you are a
    “U.S. stockholder.” A
    “U.S. stockholder” is a stockholder of shares of
    stock who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is:

•

a citizen or resident of the United States;

•

a corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a
    corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
    organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any
    political subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•

an estate, the income of which is subject to United States
    federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•

a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise
    primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one
    or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal
    Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the
    trust’s substantial decisions.

So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, distributions on
    shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated
    earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not
    designated as capital gain dividends) will be includable as
    ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. None of these
    distributions will be eligible for the dividends received
    deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.

Generally, for taxable years ending after May 6, 2003
    through December 31, 2008, the maximum marginal rate of tax
    payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations
    that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15%. Except in
    limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to dividends
    paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not
    subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable
    income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The
    reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that
    portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect to
    our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received
    by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT
    subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect
    to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax
    during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute
    100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or
    (3) the amount of any earnings and profits that were
    distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year.

Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will
    be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not
    exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year),
    without regard to the period for which you held our stock.
    However, if you are a corporation, you may be required to treat
    a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income.

If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net long-term
    capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital
    gain, your proportionate share of this net long-term capital
    gain. You would also receive a refundable tax credit for your
    proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained
    capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of
    your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable
    capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid.

You may not include in your federal income tax return any of our
    net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules
    may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and
    preferences be apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution
    declared by us in October, November or December of any year on a
    specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid
    by us and received by you on December 31 of that year,
    provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later
    than January 31 of the following year.



We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to
    treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required
    to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise
    tax discussed under “— General” and
    “— Qualification as a
    REIT  —  Annual Distribution
    Requirements” above. As a result, you may be required to
    treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would
    otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital. Moreover, any
    “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend
    (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as the case
    may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any other
    distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and
    profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these
    distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your
    shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax
    basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these
    distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero, after
    which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if
    the shares of our stock are held as a capital asset. The tax
    basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain
    or loss, if any, realized upon sale of the shares of our stock.
    Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which
    were held for six months or less (after application of certain
    holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term
    capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain
    distributions with respect to these shares of our stock.

Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with
    a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of
    our stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us,
    you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the
    difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange
    and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock. This
    gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock
    as a capital asset.

If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment can only be
    determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of
    redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as
    opposed to dividend income) equal to the difference between the
    amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax
    basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption results in a
    “complete termination” of your interest in all classes
    of our equity securities, is a “substantially
    disproportionate redemption” or is “not essentially
    equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you. In applying
    these tests, there must be taken into account your ownership of
    all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common stock,
    preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must
    take into account any equity securities that are considered to
    be constructively owned by you.

If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you no
    longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity
    securities or only own (actually and constructively) an
    insubstantial percentage of our equity securities, then it is
    probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered
    “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and, thus,
    would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a
    distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a
    dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances,
    and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption,
    you should consult your tax advisor to determine their
    application to the particular situation.

Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests described
    above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of
    your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a
    dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or
    accumulated earnings and profits. If the redemption is taxed as
    a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will
    be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If
    you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain
    circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related
    person, or it may be lost entirely.

Gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than
    one year is taxed at a maximum long-term capital gain rate,
    which is currently 15%. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service
    guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends
    as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as
    gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt
    U.S. Stockholders.

Tax-exempt entities,
    including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts
    and individual retirement accounts (“Exempt
    Organizations”), generally are exempt from federal income
    taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their
    unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The
    Internal Revenue Service has issued a published revenue ruling
    that dividend distributions from a REIT to an exempt employee
    pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares
    of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or
    business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on this
    ruling, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations
    generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt
    Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock
    with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI
    pursuant to the



“debt financed property” rules. Likewise, a portion of
    the Exempt Organization’s income from us would constitute
    UBTI if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage
    investment conduit.

In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns
    more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a percentage of
    our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension trust
    holding more than 10% of our stock only if (1) the
    percentage of our income that is UBTI (determined as if we were
    a pension trust) is at least 5%, (2) we qualify as a REIT
    by reason of the modification of the Five or Fewer Requirement
    that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as
    holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the
    pension trust, and (3) either (i) one pension trust
    owns more than 25% of the value of our stock or (ii) a
    group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of
    the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the
    value of our stock.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

Under certain circumstances, you may
    be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments
    made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of,
    shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply only if you:
    (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
    number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your
    social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer
    identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
    Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments
    of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under
    penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer
    identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has
    not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made
    to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and
    tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor
    regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding,
    and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding
    is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup
    withholding with respect to payment to a stockholder will be
    allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s United
    States federal income tax liability and may entitle such
    stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information
    is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition,
    withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to
    stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to
    certify their non-foreign status.

Taxation of Foreign Stockholders.

The
    following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign
    person. The federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly
    complex matter that may be affected by many considerations.

Except as discussed below, distributions to you of cash
    generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary
    dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital
    assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a
    rate of 30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax
    and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate.

In general, you will be subject to United States federal income
    tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with
    respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is
    “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade
    or business in the United States. A corporate foreign
    stockholder that receives income that is, or is treated as,
    effectively connected with a United States trade or business may
    also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in
    addition to regular United States corporate income tax. The
    following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose
    investment in us is not so effectively connected. We expect to
    withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the
    gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless
    (1) you file an Internal Revenue Service

Form W-8ECI

with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively
    connected” or (2) certain other exceptions apply.

Distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale
    or exchange of a United States real property interest will be
    taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax
    Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were
    gains “effectively connected” with a United States
    trade or business. Accordingly, you will be taxed at the normal
    capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on
    these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax
    and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident
    alien individuals. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be
    subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate
    foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption.



We will be required to withhold from distributions subject to
    FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of
    designated capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the
    amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital
    gain dividends. In addition, if we designate prior distributions
    as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions, up to the
    amount of the prior distributions not withheld against, will be
    treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.

For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, any
    capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is
    “regularly traded” on an established securities market
    will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign
    stockholder did not own more than 5% of such class of stock at
    any time during the taxable year. Once this provision takes
    effect, foreign stockholders generally will not be required to
    report distributions received from us on U.S. federal
    income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends
    for U.S. federal income tax purposes including any capital
    gain dividend will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax
    (unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as
    discussed above. In addition, the branch profits tax will no
    longer apply to such distributions.

Unless our shares constitute a “United States real property
    interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively
    connected with a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our
    shares by you generally will not be subject to United States
    taxation. Our shares will not constitute a United States real
    property interest if we qualify as a “domestically
    controlled REIT.” We do, and expect to continue to, qualify
    as a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled
    REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing
    period less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or
    indirectly by foreign stockholders. However, if you are a
    nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States
    for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain
    other conditions apply, you will be subject to a 30% tax on such
    capital gains. In any event, a purchaser of our shares from you
    will not be required under FIRPTA to withhold on the purchase
    price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded”
    on an established securities market or if we are a domestically
    controlled REIT. Otherwise, under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be
    required to withhold 10% of the purchase price and remit such
    amount to the Internal Revenue Service.

Backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally
    not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States
    that are treated as (1) dividends to which the 30% or lower
    treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies;
    (2) capital gains dividends; or (3) distributions
    attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of
    U.S. real property interests. Payment of the proceeds of a
    sale of stock within the United States or conducted through
    certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is subject to
    both backup withholding and information reporting unless the
    beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or
    she is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have
    actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a
    U.S. person) or otherwise established an exemption. You may
    obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
    withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund
    with the Internal Revenue Service.

U.S. Federal
    Income Taxation of Holders of Depositary Shares

Owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were
    owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the
    depositary shares. Thus, you will be required to take into
    account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled
    if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock.

Conversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred
    Stock.

No gain or loss will be recognized upon
    the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary
    shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will,
    upon exchange, be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the
    depositary shares exchanged. If you held your depositary shares
    as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of
    preferred stock, the holding period for your shares of preferred
    stock will include the period during which you owned the
    depositary shares.

U.S. Federal
    Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Debt
    Securities

The following is a general summary of the United States federal
    income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder
    that is a

non-U.S. holder,

as defined below, the United States federal estate tax
    consequences, of purchasing, owning and disposing of debt
    securities periodically offered under one or more indentures,
    the forms of which have been filed as exhibits to this
    registration statement (the “notes”). This summary
    assumes that you hold the notes as capital assets. This summary
    applies to you only if you are the initial holder of the notes
    and you acquire



the notes for a price equal to the issue price of the notes. The
    issue price of the notes is the first price at which a
    substantial amount of the notes is sold other than to bond
    houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in
    the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers.
    In addition, this summary does not consider any foreign, state,
    local or other tax laws that may be applicable to us or a
    purchaser of the notes.

U.S. Holders

The following summary applies to you only if you are a
    U.S. holder, as defined below.

Definition of a U.S. Holder.

A
    “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a note or
    notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes:

•

a citizen or resident of the United States;

•

a corporation or partnership, or other entity classified as a
    corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
    organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any
    political subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•

an estate, the income of which is subject to United States
    federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•

a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise
    primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one
    or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal
    Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the
    trust’s substantial decisions.

Payments of Interest.

Stated interest on the
    notes generally will be taxed as ordinary interest income from
    domestic sources at the time it is paid or accrues in accordance
    with your method of accounting for tax purposes.

Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of
    Notes.

The adjusted tax basis in your note
    acquired at a premium will generally be your cost. You generally
    will recognize taxable gain or loss when you sell or otherwise
    dispose of your notes equal to the difference, if any, between:

•

the amount realized on the sale or other disposition, less any
    amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will be
    taxable in the manner described under “— Payments
    of Interest” above; and

•

your adjusted tax basis in the notes.

Your gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. This
    capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if
    at the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the
    notes for more than one year. Subject to limited exceptions,
    your capital losses cannot be used to offset your ordinary
    income.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

In general, “backup
    withholding” may apply to any payments made to you of
    principal and interest on your note, and to payment of the
    proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your note before
    maturity, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder and
    (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
    number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your
    social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer
    identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
    Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments
    of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under
    penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer
    identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has
    not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.

The amount of any reportable payments, including interest, made
    to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of
    tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be
    reported to you and to the Internal Revenue Service for each
    calendar year. You should consult your tax advisor regarding
    your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and
    the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable.
    The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be
    credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability,
    provided that correct information is provided to the Internal
    Revenue Service.

Non-U.S. Holders

The following summary applies to you if you are a beneficial
    owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above
    (a

“non-U.S. holder”).



Special rules may apply to certain

non-U.S. holders

such as “controlled foreign corporations,”
    “passive foreign investment companies” and
    “foreign personal holding companies.” Such entities
    are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the
    United States federal, state, local and other tax consequences
    that may be relevant to them.

U.S. Federal Withholding Tax.

Subject to
    the discussion below, U.S. federal withholding tax will not
    apply to payments by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as
    such, of principal and interest on your notes under the
    “portfolio interest” exception of the Internal Revenue
    Code, provided that:

•

you do not, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively,
    own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
    classes of our stock entitled to vote;

•

you are not (1) a controlled foreign corporation for U.S.
    federal income tax purposes that is related, directly or
    indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership, as
    provided in the Internal Revenue Code, or (2) a bank
    receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
    Internal Revenue Code;

•

such interest is not effectively connected with your conduct of
    a U.S. trade or business; and

•

you provide a signed written statement, under penalties of
    perjury, which can reliably be related to you, certifying that
    you are not a U.S. person within the meaning of the
    Internal Revenue Code and providing your name and address to:

•

us or our paying agent; or

•

a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial
    institution that holds customers’ securities in the
    ordinary course of its trade or business and holds your notes on
    your behalf and that certifies to us or our paying agent under
    penalties of perjury that it, or the bank or financial
    institution between it and you, has received from you your
    signed, written statement and provides us or our paying agent
    with a copy of such statement.

Treasury regulations provide that:

•

if you are a foreign partnership, the certification requirement
    will generally apply to your partners, and you will be required
    to provide certain information;

•

if you are a foreign trust, the certification requirement will
    generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners depending
    on whether you are a “foreign complex trust,
    ““foreign simple trust, “or “foreign grantor
    trust” as defined in the Treasury regulations; and

•

look-through rules will apply for tiered partnerships, foreign
    simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts.

If you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, you should
    consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these
    Treasury regulations and the certification requirements
    applicable to you.

If you cannot satisfy the portfolio interest requirements
    described above, payments of interest will be subject to the 30%
    United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a
    properly executed (1) Internal Revenue Service

Form W-8BEN

claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the
    benefit of an applicable treaty or (2) Internal Revenue
    Service

Form W-8ECI

stating that interest paid on the note is not subject to
    withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your
    conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Alternative
    documentation may be applicable in certain circumstances.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States
    and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct
    of that trade or business, you will be required to pay United
    States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis
    (although you will be exempt from the 30% withholding tax
    provided the certification requirement described above is met)
    in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as
    otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a
    foreign corporation, you may be required to pay a branch profits
    tax on the earnings and profits that are effectively connected
    to the conduct of your trade or business in the United States.



Sale, Exchange or other Disposition of
    Notes.

You generally will not have to pay
    U.S. federal income tax on any gain or income realized from
    the sale, redemption, retirement at maturity or other
    disposition of your notes, unless:

•

in the case of gain, you are an individual who is present in the
    United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year
    of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific
    other conditions are met;

•

you are subject to tax provisions applicable to certain United
    States expatriates; or

•

the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a
    U.S. trade or business.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States
    and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected
    with the conduct of that trade or business, you generally will
    be subject to U.S. income tax on a net basis on the gain.
    In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be
    subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected
    earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for
    certain items.

U.S. Federal Estate Tax.

If you are an
    individual and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the
    United States, as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax
    purposes, at the time of your death, your notes will generally
    not be subject to the U.S. federal estate tax, unless, at
    the time of your death (1) you owned actually or
    constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of
    all our classes of stock entitled to vote or (2) interest
    on the notes is effectively connected with your conduct of a
    U.S. trade or business.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

Backup withholding will not apply to
    payments of principal or interest made by us or our paying
    agent, in its capacity as such, to you if you have provided the
    required certification that you are a

non-U.S. holder

as described in “— U.S. Federal Withholding
    Tax” above, and provided that neither we nor our paying
    agent have actual knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as
    described in “— U.S. Holders” above. We
    or our paying agent may, however, report payments of interest on
    the notes.

The gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes may be
    subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If
    you sell your notes outside the United States through a

non-U.S. office

of a

non-U.S. broker

and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United
    States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information
    reporting requirements generally will not apply to that payment.
    However, U.S. information reporting, but not backup
    withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if
    that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell your
    notes through a

non-U.S.

office of a broker that:

•

is a U.S. person, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code;

•

derives 50% or more of its gross income in specific periods from
    the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;

•

is a “controlled foreign corporation” for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes; or

•

is a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year,
    one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who in the
    aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests
    in the partnership, or the foreign partnership is engaged in a
    U.S. trade or business, unless the broker has documentary
    evidence in its files that you are a

non-U.S. person

and certain other conditions are met or you otherwise establish
    an exemption. If you receive payments of the proceeds of a sale
    of your notes to or through a U.S. office of a broker, the
    payment is subject to both U.S. backup withholding and
    information reporting unless you provide a

Form W-8BEN

certifying that you are a

non-U.S. person

or you otherwise establish an exemption.

You should consult your own tax advisor regarding application of
    backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the
    availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from
    backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup
    withholding rules from a payment to you will be allowed as a
    refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax
    liability, provided the required information is furnished to the
    Internal Revenue Service.



U.S. Federal
    Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Warrants

Exercise of Warrants.

You will not generally
    recognize gain or loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your
    basis in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares
    or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise
    of the warrant will be equal to the sum of your adjusted tax
    basis in the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding
    period in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary
    shares or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the
    exercise of the warrant will not include the period during which
    the warrant was held by you.

Expiration of Warrants.

Upon the expiration of
    a warrant, you will recognize a capital loss in an amount equal
    to your adjusted tax basis in the warrant.

Sale or Exchange of Warrants.

Upon the sale or
    exchange of a warrant to a person other than us, you will
    recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
    between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your
    adjusted tax basis in the warrant. Such gain or loss will be
    capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss
    if the warrant was held for more than one year. Upon the sale of
    the warrant to us, the Internal Revenue Service may argue that
    you should recognize ordinary income on the sale. You are
    advised to consult your own tax advisors as to the consequences
    of a sale of a warrant to us.

Potential
    Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax
    Consequences

Current and prospective securities holders should recognize that
    the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us
    may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative
    action at any time and that any such action may affect
    investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing
    with federal income taxation are constantly under review by
    persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal
    Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in
    revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of
    established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in
    federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could
    adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.

Risk
    Factors

Forward-Looking
    Statements and Risk Factors

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements
    that constitute “forward-looking statements” as that
    term is defined in the federal securities laws. These
    forward-looking statements include those regarding:

•

the possible expansion of our portfolio;

•

the sale of properties;

•

the performance of our operators and properties;

•

our ability to enter into agreements with new viable tenants for
    properties that we take back from financially troubled tenants,
    if any;

•

our ability to make distributions;

•

our policies and plans regarding investments, financings and
    other matters;

•

our tax status as a real estate investment trust;

•

our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity;



•

our ability to access capital markets or other sources of
    funds; and

•

our ability to meet our earnings guidance.

For example, when we use words such as “may,”
    “will,” “intend,” “should,”
    “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
    “estimate” or similar expressions, we are making
    forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
    uncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and
    actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This
    may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited
    to:

•

the status of the economy;

•

the status of capital markets, including prevailing interest
    rates;

•

serious issues facing the health care industry, including
    compliance with, and changes to, regulations and payment
    policies and operators’ difficulty in obtaining and
    maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;

•

changes in financing terms;

•

competition within the health care and senior housing industries;

•

negative developments in the operating results or financial
    condition of operators, including, but not limited to, their
    ability to pay rent and repay loans;

•

the Company’s ability to transition or sell facilities with
    profitable results;

•

the failure of closings to occur as and when anticipated;

•

acts of God affecting our properties;

•

our ability to reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to assets
    sold;

•

operator bankruptcies or insolvencies;

•

government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid
    reimbursement rates;

•

liability claims and insurance costs for our operators;

•

unanticipated difficulties

and/or

expenditures relating to future acquisitions;

•

environmental laws affecting our properties;

•

delays in reinvestment of sale proceeds;

•

changes in rules or practices governing the Company’s
    financial reporting;

•

other factors, including REIT qualification, anti-takeover
    provisions and key management personnel; and

•

the risks described below:

Risk
    factors related to our operators’ revenues and
    expenses

Our facility operators’ revenues are primarily driven by
    occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable,
    and private pay rates. Expenses for these facilities are
    primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes,
    insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government
    reimbursement have, and may continue, to come under pressure due
    to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Liability
    insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our
    operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues

and/or

any
    increase in operating expenses result in a facility not
    generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our
    operator and the value of other collateral would have to be
    relied upon.



Risk
    factors related to operator bankruptcies

We are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to
    meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,
    which may result in an operator bankruptcy or insolvency, or
    that an operator might become subject to bankruptcy or
    insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating
    lease agreements provide us with the right to evict an operator,
    demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies,
    and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding
    obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid
    interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other
    remedies, the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party
    that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An operator in
    bankruptcy may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect
    unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid
    principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise
    other rights and remedies.

We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate
    taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of a facility,
    avoid the imposition of liens on a facility

and/or

transition a facility to a new operator. In some instances, we
    have terminated our lease with an operator and relet the
    facility to another operator. In some of those situations, we
    have provided working capital loans to and limited
    indemnification of the new operator. If we cannot transition a
    leased facility to a new operator, we may take possession of
    that facility, which may expose us to certain successor
    liabilities. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating
    cash flow may be adversely affected.

Risk
    factors related to government regulations

Our operators’ businesses are affected by government
    reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that a
    facility receives a significant portion of its revenues from
    governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such
    revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,
    retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments
    or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,
    payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries, government
    funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to
    specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments due
    to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such
    facility. In recent years, governmental payors have frozen or
    reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary
    pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be
    of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We
    cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect
    any future legislative reforms may have on the financial
    condition of the skilled nursing industry, the specialty care
    industry or the health care industry in general. There can be no
    assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be
    available for services provided by any facility operator,
    whether the facility receives reimbursement from Medicare,
    Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of
    services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could
    have a material adverse effect on an operator’s liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations, which could
    adversely affect the ability of an operator to meet its
    obligations to us. In addition, the replacement of an operator
    that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the
    approval process of any federal, state or local agency necessary
    for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the
    operator licensed to manage the facility. See
    “Item 1 — Business — Certain
    Government Regulations — Reimbursement”
    above.

Risk
    factors related to liability claims and insurance
    costs

Long-term care facility operators (skilled nursing facilities,
    assisted living facilities, and independent living/continuing
    care retirement communities) have experienced substantial
    increases in both the number and size of patient care liability
    claims in recent years, particularly in the states of Texas and
    Florida. As a result, general and professional liability costs
    have increased and may continue to increase. Long-term care
    liability insurance rates are increasing nationwide because of
    large jury awards in states like Texas and Florida. Over the
    past four years, both Texas and Florida have adopted skilled
    nursing facility liability laws that modify or limit tort
    damages. Despite some of these reforms, the long-term care
    industry overall continues to experience very high general and
    professional liability costs. Insurance companies have responded
    to this claims crisis by severely restricting their capacity to
    write long-term care general and professional liability
    policies. No assurances can be given that the climate for
    long-term care general and professional liability insurance will
    improve in any of the foregoing states or any other states where
    the facility operators conduct business. Insurance companies may
    continue to reduce or stop writing general and professional
    liability policies for long-term care facilities. Thus, general
    professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or
    very costly, which may adversely affect the facility
    operators’ future



operations, cash flows and financial condition, and may have a
    material adverse effect on the facility operators’ ability
    to meet their obligations to us.

Risk
    factors related to acquisitions

We are exposed to the risk that our future acquisitions may not
    prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated
    difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired
    properties, including contingent liabilities, and newly acquired
    properties might require significant management attention that
    would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree
    to provide construction funding to an operator and the project
    is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion
    of the project or we could lose the property. Moreover, if we
    issue equity securities or incur additional debt, or both, to
    finance future acquisitions, it may reduce our per share
    financial results. These costs may negatively affect our results
    of operations.

Risk
    factors related to environmental laws

Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of
    real estate may be required to respond to the release of
    hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for
    property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from
    environmental contamination. These laws also expose us to the
    possibility that we may become liable to reimburse the
    government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with
    the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a
    person based on the person’s relationship to the property.
    Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the
    condition of the property and since we are a passive landlord,
    we do not “participate in the management” of any
    property in which we have an interest. Moreover, we review
    environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or
    encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments
    are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry”
    standard, which qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense
    if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments,
    we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to
    material environmental contamination. However, environmental
    liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur
    costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Risk
    factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds

From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the
    proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments
    on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,
    including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master
    leases or similar financial support arrangements. We must
    re-invest these proceeds, on a timely basis, in properties or in
    qualified short-term investments. We compete for real estate
    investments with a broad variety of potential investors. This
    competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our
    ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us.
    Delays in acquiring properties may negatively impact revenues
    and perhaps our ability to make distributions to stockholders.

Other
    risk factors

We are also subject to a number of other risks. First, we might
    fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. We intend to
    operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe we
    have and will continue to operate in such a manner. Since REIT
    qualification requires us to meet a number of complex
    requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them,
    and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of
    federal taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the
    amount we could distribute to our stockholders. Also, if we were
    not a REIT, we would not be required to make distributions to
    stockholders since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends
    to stockholders amounting to at least 90% of its annual taxable
    income (including 100% of capital gains). See
    “Item 1 — Business — Taxation”
    for a discussion of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
    that apply to us and the effects of non-qualification.

Second, our Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
    Amended and Restated By-Laws contain anti-takeover provisions
    (staggered board provisions, restrictions on share ownership and
    transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements
    for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for
    or even prevent



a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our
    incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that
    inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market
    value of our common stock.

Third, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we have
    entered into employment agreements with our executive officers,
    losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have an
    adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more
    than one would have a material adverse impact on our business.

Our Board of Directors approved a new quarterly dividend rate of
    $0.64 per share of common stock per quarter, commencing
    with the May 2006 dividend. Our dividend policy is reviewed
    annually by the Board of Directors. The declaration and payment
    of quarterly dividends remains subject to the review and
    approval of the Board of Directors.

On September 29, 2003, we issued 1,060,000 shares of
    6% Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred
    Stock as partial consideration for an acquisition of assets by
    us, with the shares valued at $26,500,000 for such purposes. The
    shares were issued to Southern Assisted Living, Inc. and certain
    of its shareholders without registration in reliance upon the
    federal statutory exemption of Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The shares have a
    liquidation value of $25 per share. The preferred stock,
    which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us on or after
    August 15, 2008. The preferred shares are convertible into
    common stock at a conversion price of $32.66 per share at
    any time. During the three months ended December 31, 2005,
    certain holders of our Series E Cumulative Convertible and
    Redeemable Preferred Stock converted 4,559 shares into
    3,487 shares of common stock, leaving 74,989 of such shares
    outstanding at December 31, 2005. These shares are not

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and
    enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash
    dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase
    dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual
    increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To
    meet these objectives, we invest in properties managed by
    experienced operators and diversify our investment portfolio by
    operator and geographic location.

Substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from
    operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest
    earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent
    our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are
    dependent upon our operators’ continued ability to make
    contractual rent and interest payments to us. To the extent that
    our operators experience operating difficulties and are unable
    to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could
    be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our
    investments through a variety of methods determined by the type
    of facility and operator. Our asset management process includes
    review of monthly financial statements for each facility,
    periodic review of operator credit, periodic facility
    inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to
    licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other
    collateral. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a
    proprietary database to collect and analyze facility-specific
    data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain
    industry trends and risks. Through these asset management and
    research efforts, we are typically able to intervene at an early
    stage to address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the
    collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment.

In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we
    also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. We
    typically limit our investments to no more than 90% of the
    appraised value of a property. Operating leases and loans are
    normally credit enhanced by guaranties

and/or

letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically
    structured as master leases and loans are generally
    cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with



other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the
    operator and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2005, 87%
    of our real property was subject to master leases.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, rental income and
    interest income represented 90% and 8%, respectively, of total
    gross revenues (including discontinued operations). Prior to
    June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual
    rental escalators, which were generally recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the initial lease period. Beginning in
    June 2004, our new standard lease structure contains annual
    rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the
    Consumer Price Index

and/or

changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s
    properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line
    rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. This
    lease structure initially generates lower revenues and earnings
    compared to leases with fixed escalators that require
    straight-lining, but enables us to generate additional organic
    growth and minimize non-cash straight-line rent over time. This
    change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay
    dividends. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number
    of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average
    principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any
    interest rate adjustments.

Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we
    anticipate making investments in additional facilities. New
    investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under
    our unsecured lines of credit arrangements, internally generated
    cash and the proceeds from sales of real property. Our
    investments generate internal cash from rent and interest
    receipts and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent
    financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn
    under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements, is expected to
    be provided through a combination of public and private
    offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence of
    secured debt. We believe our liquidity and various sources of
    available capital are sufficient to fund operations, meet debt
    service obligations (both principal and interest), make dividend
    distributions and finance future investments.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new
    investments will be available in the future with spreads over
    our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to
    our stockholders. We expect to complete gross new investments of
    $450,000,000 to $550,000,000 in 2006, including acquisitions of
    $300,000,000 and funded new development of $150,000,000 to
    $250,000,000. We anticipate the sale of real property and the
    repayment of loans receivable totaling approximately
    $100,000,000 to $150,000,000 during 2006. It is possible that
    additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur
    in the future. To the extent that loan repayments and real
    property sales exceed new investments, our revenues and cash
    flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to
    reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property
    sales in new investments. To the extent that new investment
    requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to
    borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements. At
    December 31, 2005, we had $36,237,000 of cash and cash
    equivalents and $345,000,000 of available borrowing capacity
    under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements.



Key
    Transactions in 2005

We completed the following key transactions during the year
    ended December 31, 2005:

•

our Board of Directors increased our quarterly common dividend
    to $0.62 per share, which represents a two cent increase
    from the quarterly dividend of $0.60 paid for 2004. The dividend
    paid for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 represents the
    139th consecutive dividend payment;

•

we completed $642,483,000 of gross investments and had
    $147,021,000 of investment payoffs;

•

we closed on a $500,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility
    to replace our $310,000,000 facility which was scheduled to
    mature in May 2006. Among other things, the new facility
    provides us with additional financial flexibility and borrowing
    capacity, reduces our all-in borrowing costs by approximately
    50 basis points, extends our agreement to June 2008 and
    permits us to increase the facility by $50,000,000 through an
    accordion feature during the first 24 months;

•

we issued $250,000,000 of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due
    May 2015 at an effective yield of 5.913% in April 2005. We used
    proceeds from this offering to fund: (a) a redemption of
    all of our outstanding $50,000,000 8.17% senior unsecured
    notes due March 2006; (b) a redemption of $122,500,000 of
    our outstanding $175,000,000 7.5% senior unsecured notes
    due August 2007; and (c) a public tender offer for
    $57,670,000 of our outstanding $100,000,000 7.625% senior
    unsecured notes due March 2008;

•

we completed a public offering of 3,000,000 shares of
    common stock with net proceeds to the company of $100,977,000 in
    November 2005; and

•

we issued $300,000,000 of 6.2% senior unsecured notes due
    June 2016 at an effective yield of 6.246% in December 2005.

Key
    Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties

We utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the
    various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed
    below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and
    concentration risk. Management uses these key performance
    indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to
    our historical operating results, in making operating decisions
    and for budget planning purposes.

Operating Performance.

We believe that net
    income available to common stockholders (“NICS”) is
    the most appropriate earnings measure. Other useful supplemental
    measures of our operating performance include funds from
    operations (“FFO”) and funds available for
    distribution (“FAD”); however, these supplemental
    measures are not defined by U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principals (“U.S. GAAP”). Please refer
    to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures” for further discussion of FFO and FAD and for
    reconciliations of FFO and FAD to NICS. These earning measures
    and their relative per share amounts are widely used by
    investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and
    investment recommendations of companies. The following table
    reflects the recent historical trends of our operating
    performance measures (in thousands, except per share data):

Credit Strength.

We measure our credit
    strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios.
    Our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization and debt
    to market capitalization. The leverage ratios indicate how much
    of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term
    debt. Our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and
    fixed charge coverage ratio. The coverage ratios indicate our
    ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest plus
    preferred dividends). We expect to maintain capitalization
    ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain investment
    grade ratings with Moody’s Investors Service,
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch
    Ratings. The coverage ratios are based on earnings before
    interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    (“EBITDA”) which is discussed in further detail, and
    reconciled to net income, below in “Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures.” Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely
    used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the
    valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of
    companies. The following table reflects the recent historical
    trends for our credit strength measures:

Concentration Risk.

We evaluate our
    concentration risk in terms of asset mix, investment mix,
    operator mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a
    valuable measure in understanding what portion of our
    investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to
    experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our
    investments that are real property. In order to qualify as an
    equity REIT, at least 75% of our real estate investments must be
    real property whereby each property, which includes the land,
    buildings, improvements and related rights, is owned by us and
    leased to an operator pursuant to a long-term operating lease.
    Investment mix measures the portion of our investments that
    relate to our various facility types. Operator mix measures the
    portion of our investments that relate to our top five
    operators. The following table reflects our recent historical
    trends of concentration risk:

    definitions and reclassified certain of our existing facilities
    to this classification.

We evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with
    current expectations to determine if historical trends are
    indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be
    achieved and actual results may differ materially from our
    expectations. Management regularly monitors various economic and
    other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed
    to improve performance and maximize our competitive position.
    Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent
    upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to
    appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific
    trends. Please refer to “Item 1A — Risk
    Factors” above for further discussion.

Portfolio
    Update

Payment coverages in our portfolio continue to improve. Our
    overall payment coverage is at 1.92 times and represents an
    increase of 14 basis points from 2004 and 39 basis
    points from 2003. The following table reflects our recent
    historical trends of portfolio coverages. Coverage data reflects
    the 12 months ended for the periods presented. CBMF
    represents the ratio of facilities’ earnings before
    interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management
    fees to contractual rent or interest due us. CAMF represents the
    ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
    amortization, and rent (but after management fees) to
    contractual rent or interest due us.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Sources
    and Uses of Cash

Our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts,
    borrowings under unsecured lines of credit arrangements, public
    and private offerings of debt and equity securities, proceeds
    from the sales of real property and principal payments on loans
    receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend
    distributions, debt service payments (including principal and
    interest), real property acquisitions, loan advances and general
    and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of cash are
    reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are
    discussed in further detail below.

Operating Activities.

The increases in net
    cash provided from operating activities are primarily
    attributable to increases in net income, excluding the provision
    for depreciation and net straight-line rental income. Net income
    and the provision for depreciation increased primarily as a
    result of net new investments in properties owned by us. See the
    discussion of investing activities below for additional details.
    To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional
    properties in the future, our net income and provision for
    depreciation will change accordingly. Net straight-line rental
    income decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross
    straight-line rental income and increases in cash payments
    outside normal monthly rental payments.

    thousands):

Gross straight-line rental income represents the non-cash
    difference between contractual cash rent due and the average
    rent recognized pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 13 “Accounting for Leases.” This
    amount is positive in the first half of a lease term (but
    declining every year due to annual increases in cash rent due)
    and is negative in the second half of a lease term. The decrease
    in gross straight-line rental income is primarily due to annual
    increases in cash rent due on leases with fixed increases and
    our decision in 2004 to change our



standard lease structure. Prior to June 2004 our standard lease
    structure contained fixed annual rental escalators, which were
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial
    lease period. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease
    structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent
    upon changes in the Consumer Price Index

and/or

changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s
    properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line
    rent is recorded. Instead, rental income is recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payment due for the period. The
    increase in non-recurring cash receipts are primarily
    attributable to cash received in connection with real property
    sales that resulted in the payoff of existing straight-line
    receivable balances.

Investing Activities.

The changes in net cash
    used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net

We repaid $40,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes upon
    maturity in April 2004. In May 2005, we redeemed all of our
    outstanding $50,000,000 8.17% senior unsecured notes due March
    2006, we completed a public tender offer for $57,670,000 of our
    outstanding $100,000,000 7.625% senior unsecured notes due
    March 2008, and we redeemed $122,500,000 of our outstanding
    $175,000,000 7.5% senior unsecured notes due August 2007. The
    increase in principal payments on secured debt during 2005 is
    primarily due to early extinguishments of outstanding mortgages.
    During the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid off
    mortgages with outstanding balances of $72,309,000 and average
    interest rates of 7.481%.

The change in common stock is primarily attributable to public
    and private issuances and common stock issuances related to our
    dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan
    (“DRIP”). The remaining difference in common stock
    issuances is primarily due to issuances pursuant to stock
    incentive plans.

In July 2003, we closed on a public offering of
    4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock, which generated net proceeds of
    approximately $96,850,000. A portion of the proceeds from this
    offering were used to redeem all 3,000,000 shares of our
    8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on
    July 15, 2003, at a redemption price of $25 per share
    plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In September 2004, we closed
    on a public offering of 7,000,000 shares of 7.625%
    Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, which
    generated net proceeds of approximately $169,107,000. The
    proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines
    of credit arrangements and to invest in additional properties.

In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (including
    100% of capital gains) to our stockholders. The increases in
    dividends are primarily attributable to increases in outstanding
    common and preferred stock shares as discussed above and
    increases in our annual common stock dividend per share.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit
    of certain insurance companies that provide workers’
    compensation insurance to one of our tenants. Our obligation
    under the letter of credit matures in 2009. At December 31,
    2005, our obligation under the letter of credit was $2,450,000.

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may or
    may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge
    interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on
    the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates, our
    perception of the future volatility of interest rates and our
    relative levels of variable rate debt and variable rate
    investments. As of December 31, 2005, we participated in
    two interest rate swap agreements related to our long-term debt.
    Our interest rate swaps are discussed below in “Contractual
    Obligations.”

Unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements reflected at 100% capacity.

We have an unsecured credit arrangement with a consortium of ten
    banks providing for a revolving line of credit (“revolving
    credit”) in the amount of $500,000,000, which expires on
    June 22, 2008 (with the ability to extend for one year at
    our discretion if we are in compliance with all covenants). The
    agreement specifies that borrowings under the revolving credit
    are subject to interest payable in periods no longer than three
    months at either the agent bank’s prime rate of interest or
    the applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate, at our option
    (5.387% at December 31, 2005). The applicable margin is
    based on our ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.9% at
    December 31, 2005. In addition, we pay a facility fee
    annually to each bank based on the bank’s commitment under
    the revolving credit facility. The facility fee depends on our
    ratings



with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard &
    Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.225% at December 31,
    2005. We also pay an annual agent’s fee of $50,000.
    Principal is due upon expiration of the agreement. We have
    another unsecured line of credit arrangement with a bank for a
    total of $40,000,000, which expires May 31, 2006.
    Borrowings under this line of credit are subject to interest at
    either the bank’s prime rate of interest (7.25% at
    December 31, 2005) or 1.3% over LIBOR interest rate,
    at our option. Principal is due upon expiration of the
    agreement. At December 31, 2005, we had $195,000,000
    outstanding under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements and
    estimated total contractual interest obligations of $26,262,000.
    Contractual interest obligations are estimated based on the
    assumption that the balance of $195,000,000 at December 31,
    2005 is constant until maturity at interest rates in effect at
    December 31, 2005.

We have $1,194,830,000 of senior unsecured notes principal
    outstanding with fixed annual interest rates ranging from 5.875%
    to 8.0%, payable semi-annually. Total contractual interest
    obligations on senior unsecured notes totaled $647,298,000 at
    December 31, 2005. Additionally, we have 31 mortgage loans
    totaling $107,540,000, collateralized by owned properties, with
    fixed annual interest rates ranging from 5.8% to 8.5%, payable
    monthly. The carrying values of the properties securing the
    mortgage loans totaled $167,230,000 at December 31, 2005.
    Total contractual interest obligations on mortgage loans totaled
    $32,715,000 at December 31, 2005.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
    of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
    debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps
    are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we
    utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The
    Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a
    fixed rate of 6% and pay a variable rate based on six-month
    LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2005, total
    contractual interest obligations were estimated to be
    $43,200,000.

At December 31, 2005, we had operating lease obligations of
    $14,257,000 relating to our office space, five assisted living
    facilities and three skilled nursing facilities.

Purchase obligations are comprised of unfunded construction
    commitments and contingent purchase obligations. At
    December 31, 2005, we had outstanding construction
    financings of $3,906,000 for leased properties and were
    committed to providing additional financing of approximately
    $36,519,000 to complete construction. At December 31, 2005,
    we had contingent purchase obligations totaling $44,930,000.
    These contingent purchase obligations primarily relate to
    deferred acquisition fundings and capital improvements. Deferred
    acquisition fundings are contingent upon a tenant satisfying
    certain conditions in the lease. Upon funding, amounts due from
    the tenant are increased to reflect the additional investment in
    the property.

Capital
    Structure

As of December 31, 2005, we had stockholders’ equity
    of $1,430,756,000 and a total outstanding debt balance of
    $1,500,818,000, which represents a debt to total book
    capitalization ratio of 51%. Our ratio of debt to market
    capitalization was 40% at December 31, 2005. For the year
    ended December 31, 2005, our coverage ratio of EBITDA to
    interest was 3.10 to 1.00. For the year ended December 31,
    2005, our coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges was 2.47 to
    1.00. Also, at December 31, 2005, we had $36,237,000 of
    cash and cash equivalents and $345,000,000 of available
    borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require
    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth
    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
    create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of
    December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all of the
    covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements
    contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by
    our debt ratings. However, under our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used
    to determine the fees and interest payable.

Our senior unsecured notes are rated Baa3 (stable), BBB-
    (positive) and BBB- (stable) by Moody’s Investors Service,
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch
    Ratings, respectively. We plan to manage the Company to maintain
    investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with
    our current profile. Any downgrades in



terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the noted rating
    agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and
    availability of capital, which could in turn have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
    liquidity

and/or

financial condition.

As of February 28, 2006, we had an effective shelf
    registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission under which we may issue up to $429,344,619 of
    securities including debt securities, common and preferred
    stock, depositary shares, warrants and units. Also, as of
    February 28, 2006, we had an effective registration
    statement on file in connection with our enhanced DRIP program
    under which we may issue up to 6,314,213 shares of common
    stock. As of February 28, 2006, 2,718,433 shares of
    common stock remained available for issuance under this
    registration statement. Depending upon market conditions, we
    anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements
    to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under
    our unsecured lines of credit arrangements.

Net income available to common stockholders decreased 14% from
    2004 and 11% from 2003 primarily due to the losses on
    extinguishment of debt totaling $21,484,000, or $0.39 per
    diluted share, and increases in interest expense, provision for
    depreciation and preferred stock dividends, offset by increases
    in rental income. Net income available to common stockholders
    increased 3% from 2003 to 2004 due to an increase in rental
    income offset by increases in interest expense and provision for
    depreciation. These changes are discussed in further detail
    below. Net income available to common stockholders decreased on
    a per share basis during 2005 due to the lower net income
    available to common stockholders discussed above and higher
    outstanding shares. Net income available to common stockholders
    decreased on a per share basis during 2004 primarily due to
    higher outstanding shares. On a fully diluted basis, average
    common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31,
    2005 was 54,499,000, a 5% increase from 52,082,000 for the same
    period in 2004 and an 18% increase from 44,201,000 for the same
    period in 2003. The increase in fully diluted average common
    shares outstanding is primarily the result of public and private
    common stock offerings and common stock issuances pursuant to
    our DRIP.

The following table represents the changes in outstanding common
    stock for the period from January 1, 2003 to

The decrease in FFO for the year ended December 31, 2005 is
    primarily due to the losses on extinguishment of debt. The
    increase in FFO for the year ended December 31, 2004 is
    primarily due to the increase in net income available to common
    stockholders. The increases in FAD are primarily due to the
    changes in net straight-line rental income offset by the losses
    on extinguishment of debt. Please refer to the discussion of
    “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further
    information regarding FFO and FAD and for reconciliations of FFO
    and FAD to NICS.



The increases in EBITDA are primarily due to increases in net
    income, excluding interest expense and provision for
    depreciation. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest was
    3.10 times for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared
    with 3.24 times for the same period in 2004 and 3.50 times for
    the same period in 2003. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed
    charges was 2.47 times for the year ended December 31, 2005
    as compared with 2.77 times for the same period in 2004 and 3.01
    times for the same period in 2003. Our coverage ratios declined
    from the prior years primarily due to the losses on
    extinguishment of debt and increases in interest expense. Please
    refer to the discussion of “Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures” below for further information regarding EBITDA
    and a reconciliation of EBITDA and net income.

The increase in gross revenues is primarily attributable to
    increased rental income resulting from the acquisitions of new
    properties from which we receive rent. See the discussion of
    investing activities in “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” above for further information. In addition, as
    discussed above, prior to June 2004, our standard lease
    structure contained fixed annual rental escalators, which were
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum
    lease period. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease
    structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent
    upon changes in the Consumer Price Index

and/or

changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s
    properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line
    rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. While
    this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay
    dividends, it is anticipated that we will generate additional
    organic growth and minimize non-cash straight-line rent over
    time. If gross operating revenues at our facilities

and/or

the
    Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues
    may not continue to increase. Sales of real property would
    offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new
    acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues. Our leases
    could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an
    increase or decrease in rental income. As of December 31,
    2005, we had no leases expiring prior to 2009 with the exception
    of our master lease with Commonwealth Communities Holdings LLC.
    In October 2005, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (“Kindred”)
    announced its intent to acquire Commonwealth. As part of this
    transaction, which closed on February 28, 2006, we leased
    the Commonwealth facilities to Kindred under two master leases.

Interest income increased in 2005 primarily due to recognition
    of additional interest income of approximately $4,509,000 offset
    by loan payoffs. The additional interest income related to the
    payoffs of loans that were either on non-accrual or partial
    accrual and all contractual interest was received from the
    borrowers. Transaction fees and other income fluctuated
    primarily due to $822,000 of extinguishment recoveries, $750,000
    in termination fees as well as additional fees from loan payoffs
    recognized during the year ended December 31, 2005. The
    decrease from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the $902,000 gain
    from the sale of our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance
    L.P. in October 2003.

The increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to
    increases in interest expense, the provision for depreciation
    and the recognition of losses on extinguishment of debt. The
    increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher
    average borrowings and changes in the amount of capitalized
    interest offsetting interest expense. This was partially offset
    by lower average interest rates and savings generated from
    interest rate swap agreements. If we borrow under our unsecured
    lines of credit arrangements, issue additional senior unsecured
    notes or assume additional secured debt, our interest expense
    will increase.

The increase in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is
    due to the net effect and timing of issuances and

The increase in interest expense on unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements is due primarily to higher average outstanding
    borrowings. The following is a summary of our unsecured lines of

We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used
    to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us.
    The amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding
    during the construction period using the rate of interest that
    approximates our cost of financing. Our interest expense is
    reduced by the amount capitalized. Capitalized interest for the
    years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 totaled
    $1,535,000, $875,000 and $665,000, respectively.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
    of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
    debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. We receive
    a fixed rate of 6.0% and pay a variable rate based on six-month
    LIBOR plus a spread. For the years ended December 31, 2005,
    and 2004, we generated $972,000 and $1,770,000, respectively, of
    savings related to our Swaps that was recorded as a reduction of
    interest expense. We had no interest rate swap agreements
    outstanding during 2003.

The provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result
    of additional investments in properties owned directly by us.
    See the discussion of investing activities in “Liquidity
    and Capital Resources” above for further information. To
    the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties
    in the future, our provision for depreciation will change
    accordingly.

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues
    (including revenues from discontinued operations) for the year
    ended December 31, 2005, were 5.89% as compared with 6.54%
    and 5.55% for the same periods in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
    The change from 2004 to 2005 is due to increased costs to
    attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business
    objectives offset by a decrease in professional service fees and
    other operating costs as a result of focused expense control.
    Approximately one-half of the increases from 2003 to 2004 were
    related to costs associated with our initiatives to attract and
    retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives.
    The remainder was comprised of increases relating to
    professional services fees (including costs associated with SOX
    compliance), taxes and transition costs associated with the
    removal of an underperforming operator in December 2004.



The change in loan expense was primarily due to increased costs
    in 2003 and 2004 related to amending our primary unsecured line
    of credit arrangement, costs related to obtaining consents to
    modify the covenants under our senior unsecured notes and costs
    related to the issuance of senior unsecured notes.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, it was determined
    that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did
    not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge
    of $314,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated
    fair market value. The estimated fair market value of the
    property was determined by an independent appraisal. During the
    year ended December 31, 2003, it was determined that the
    projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed
    its related net book value and an impairment charge of
    $2,792,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated
    fair market value. The estimated fair market value of the
    property was determined by an independent appraisal.

The provision for loan losses is related to our critical
    accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is
    discussed below in “Critical Accounting Policies.”

One assisted living facility was held for sale at
    December 31, 2005. We did not recognize an impairment loss
    on this asset as the fair market value less estimated costs to
    sell exceeded our carrying value. Also during the years ended
    December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, we sold properties with
    carrying values of $61,316,000, $37,710,000 and $88,098,000 for
    net gains of $4,139,000, net losses of $143,000 and net gains of
    $3,227,000, respectively. In accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, we have
    reclassified the income and expenses attributable to the
    properties held for sale or sold subsequent to January 1,
    2002 to discontinued operations. These properties generated
    $6,822,000, $3,415,000 and $1,905,000 of income after deducting
    depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue for the
    years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.
    Please refer to Note 15 of our audited consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion.

The increase in preferred dividends is primarily due to the
    increase in average outstanding preferred shares. The following

In July 2003, we closed a public offering of
    4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock. A portion of the proceeds from this
    offering were used to redeem all 3,000,000 shares of our
    8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on
    July 15, 2003. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task
    Force (“EITF”) Topic D-42, the costs to issue these
    securities were recorded as a non-cash, non-recurring



charge of $2,790,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the
    third quarter of 2003 to reduce net income available to common
    stockholders. No such transactions or charges occurred in 2004
    or 2005.

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures

We believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the
    most appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider FFO
    and FAD to be useful supplemental measures of our operating
    performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets
    in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the
    value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as
    evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real
    estate values have historically risen or fallen with market
    conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered
    presentations of operating results for real estate companies
    that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In
    response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment
    Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental
    measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes
    historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by
    NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real
    estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after
    adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
    FAD represents FFO excluding the non-cash straight-line rental
    adjustments. Additionally, our historical results include an
    adjustment for a preferred stock redemption charge for the year
    ended December 31, 2003 but exclude adjustments for
    impairment charges.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
    Statement No. 145 that requires gains and losses on
    extinguishment of debt to be classified as income or loss from
    continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as
    previously required under Statement No. 4. We adopted the
    standard effective January 1, 2003 and have properly
    reflected the $21,484,000, or $0.39 per diluted share, of
    losses on extinguishment of debt for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. These charges have not been added back
    for the calculations of FFO, FAD or EBITDA.

In August 2003, we adopted the SEC clarification of EITF Topic
    D-42. To implement the clarified accounting pronouncement, our
    2003 results reflect a reduction in net income available to
    common stockholders resulting from a non-cash, non-recurring
    charge of $2,790,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, due to
    the redemption of our 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable
    Preferred Stock in July 2003. NAREIT has issued its
    recommendation that preferred stock redemption charges should
    not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO and
    FAD. Although we have adopted this recommendation, we have also
    disclosed FFO and FAD adjusted for the preferred stock
    redemption charge for enhanced clarity. Additionally, we believe
    that the nature of the charge is non-recurring because there was
    not a similar charge during the two preceding years and we do
    not anticipate a similar charge in the succeeding two years.

In October 2003, NAREIT informed its member companies that the
    SEC had changed its position on certain aspects of the NAREIT
    FFO definition, including impairment charges. Previously, the
    SEC accepted NAREIT’s view that impairment charges were
    effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an
    impending sale of property and thus should be added back to net
    income in the calculation of FFO and FAD similar to other gains
    and losses on sales. However, the SEC’s clarified
    interpretation is that recurring impairments taken on real
    property may not be added back to net income in the calculation
    of FFO and FAD. We have adopted this interpretation and have not
    added back impairment charges of $2,792,000, or $0.06 per
    diluted share, recorded for the year ended December 31,
    2003 and $314,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, recorded for
    the year ended December 31, 2004.

EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization. Additionally, we exclude the non-cash
    provision for loan losses in calculating EBITDA. We believe that
    EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from
    operating activities, is an important supplemental measure
    because it provides additional information to assess and
    evaluate the performance of our operations. Additionally,
    restrictive covenants in our long-term debt arrangements contain
    financial ratios based on EBITDA. We primarily utilize EBITDA to
    measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA
    divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio,
    which represents EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges
    include total interest and preferred dividends.

FFO, FAD and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used
    by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in
    the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating
    of companies. Management uses these financial measures to
    facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical
    operating results, in



making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.
    Additionally, FFO and FAD are internal evaluation metrics
    utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. FFO,
    FAD and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided
    from operating activities as determined in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative
    measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, FFO, FAD and
    EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly
    entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts
    or other companies.

The table below reflects the reconciliation of FFO to net income
    available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable
    U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented. The provision
    for depreciation includes provision for depreciation from
    discontinued operations. Amounts are in thousands except for per

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
    with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and
    assumptions. Management considers an accounting estimate or
    assumption critical if:

•

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to
    the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for
    highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters
    to change; and

•

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial
    condition or operating performance is material.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its
    critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
    disclosure presented below relating to them. Management believes
    the current assumptions and other considerations used to
    estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial
    statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to
    change in the future. However, since these estimates require
    assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the
    estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual
    experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations
    used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated
    financial statements, the resulting changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition. Please refer to Note 1 of our audited
    consolidated financial statements for further information on
    significant accounting policies that impact us. There were no
    material changes to these policies in 2005.

We adopted the fair value-based method of accounting for
    share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the
    prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148,
    Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —



Transition and Disclosure. Because Statement 123(R) must be
    applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards
    that are not fully vested on the effective date of
    Statement 123(R), and because we adopted Statement 123
    using the prospective transition method (which applied only to
    awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date of
    Statement 123), compensation cost for some previously
    granted awards that were not recognized under Statement 123
    will be recognized under Statement 123(R). Additionally, we
    amortize compensation cost for share based payments to the date
    that the awards become fully vested or to the expected
    retirement date, if sooner. Effective with the adoption of
    Statement 123(R) on January 1, 2006, we will begin
    recognizing compensation cost to the date the awards become
    fully vested or to the retirement eligible date, if sooner. Had
    we adopted Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of
    that standard would have approximated the impact of
    Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma
    net income and earnings per share in Note 9 to our audited
    consolidated financial statements. We expect that the adoption
    of Statement 123(R) will increase compensation cost by
    approximately $1,287,000 for 2006 as a result of amortizing
    share based awards to the retirement eligible date.

The following table presents information about our critical
    accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to
    develop each estimate:

Nature of Critical

Assumptions/

Accounting Estimate

Approach Used

Allowance for Loan Losses

We maintain an allowance for loan
    losses in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No.  114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
    of a Loan, as amended, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
     102, Selected Loan Loss Allowance Methodology and
    Documentation Issues. The allowance for loan losses is
    maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential
    losses in our loans receivable. The determination of the
    allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding
    loans. If this evaluation indicates that there is a greater risk
    of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-
    accrual status may be required. A loan is impaired when, based
    on current information and events, it is probable that we will
    be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to
    the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Consistent
    with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed
    impaired. To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of
    collectibility is diminished, we will return these loans to full
    accrual status.

The determination of the allowance
    is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans,
    including general economic conditions and estimated
    collectibility of loan payments and principal. We evaluate the
    collectibility of our loans receivable based on a combination of
    factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status,
    historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower
    and guarantors and value of the underlying property.

For the year ended December  31, 2005 we recorded
    $1,200,000 as provision for loan losses, resulting in an
    allowance for loan losses of $6,461,000 relating to loans with
    outstanding balances of $31,416,000 at December  31, 2005.
    At December  31, 2005, we had loans with outstanding
    balances of $16,770,000 on non-accrual status.

Depreciation and Useful Lives

Substantially all of the properties
    owned by us are leased under operating leases and are recorded
    at cost. The cost of our real property is allocated to land,
    buildings, improvements and intangibles in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business
    Combinations. The allocation of the acquisition costs of
    properties is based on appraisals commissioned from independent
    real estate appraisal firms.

We compute depreciation on our
    properties using the straight-line method based on their
    estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40  years for
    buildings and five to 15  years for improvements.

For the year ended December  31, 2005, we recorded
    $68,061,000 and $16,767,000 as provision for depreciation
    relating to buildings and improvements, respectively, including
    amounts reclassified as discontinued operations. The average
    useful life of our buildings and improvements was 31.7
     years and 9.8  years, respectively, at December
     31, 2005.

Impairment of Long-Lived
    Assets

We review our long-lived assets for
    potential impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment and
    Disposal of Long- Lived Assets. An impairment charge must be
    recognized when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not
    recoverable. The carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds
    the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
    the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is
    determined that a permanent impairment of a long-lived asset has
    occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair
    value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference
    between the carrying value and the fair value.

The net book value of long-lived
    assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to
    determine if there are indicators of impairment. These
    indicators may include anticipated operating losses at the
    property level, the tenant’s inability to make rent
    payments, a decision to dispose of an asset before the end of
    its estimated useful life and changes in the market that may
    permanently reduce the value of the property. If indicators of
    impairment exist, then the undiscounted future cash flows from
    the most likely use of the property are compared to the current
    net book value. This analysis requires us to determine if
    indicators of impairment exist and to estimate the most likely
    stream of cash flows to be generated from the property during
    the period the property is expected to be held.

We did not record any
    impairment charges for the year ended December  31, 2005.



Nature of Critical

Assumptions/

Accounting Estimate

Approach Used

Fair Value of Derivative
    Instruments

The valuation of derivative
    instruments is accounted for in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No.  133, Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
    (‘‘SFAS133”), as amended by Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No.  138, Accounting for
    Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.
    SFAS133, as amended, requires companies to record derivatives at
    fair market value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities.

The valuation of derivative
    instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values for our
    derivatives are estimated by a third party consultant, which
    utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and
    discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts
    are subject to significant estimates which may change in the
    future. At December  31, 2005, we participated in two
    interest rate swap agreements related to our long-term debt. At
    December  31, 2005, the swaps were reported at their fair
    value as a $2,211,000 other asset. For the year ended December
     31, 2005, we generated $972,000 of savings related to our
    swaps that was recorded as a reduction in interest expense.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recorded in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  13,
    Accounting for Leases, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
     101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as
    amended (‘‘SAB101”). SAB101 requires that revenue
    be recognized after four basic criteria are met. These four
    criteria include persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the
    rendering of service, fixed and determinable income and
    reasonably assured collectibility. If the collectibility of
    revenue is determined incorrectly, the amount and timing of our
    reported revenue could be significantly affected. Interest
    income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal
    amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectibility
    risk. Prior to June 2004, our standard lease structure contained
    fixed annual rental escalators, which were generally recognized
    on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period.
    Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure
    contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon
    changes in the Consumer Price Index

and/or

changes in the gross operating revenues of the property. These
    escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded;
    however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash
    rental payments due for the period.

We evaluate the collectibility of
    our revenues and related receivables on an on-going basis. We
    evaluate collectibility based on assumptions and other
    considerations including, but not limited to, the certainty of
    payment, payment history, the financial strength of the
    investment’s underlying operations as measured by cash
    flows and payment coverages, the value of the underlying
    collateral and guaranties and current economic conditions.

If our evaluation indicates that collectibility is not
    reasonably assured, we may place an investment on non-accrual or
    reserve against all or a portion of current income as an offset
    to revenue.

For the year ended December  31, 2005 we recognized
    $23,993,000 of interest income and $262,613,000 of rental
    income, including discontinued operations. Cash receipts on
    leases with deferred revenue provisions were $13,869,000 as
    compared to gross straight-line rental income recognized of
    $13,142,000. At December  31, 2005, our straight-line
    receivable balance was $63,725,000. Also at December  31,
    2005, we had loans with outstanding balances of $16,770,000 on
    non-accrual status.

Impact of
    Inflation

During the past three years, inflation has not significantly
    affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate.
    Additionally, our earnings are primarily long-term investments
    with fixed rates of return. These investments are mainly
    financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes
    and borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements.
    During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by
    rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely
    affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a
    slower rate than new borrowing costs. Presuming the current
    inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do
    not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not
    impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We seek to
    mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by
    matching the terms of new investments with new long-term fixed
    rate borrowings to the extent possible. We may or may not elect
    to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate
    exposure. These decisions are principally based on our policy to
    match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings,
    but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the
    applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of
    interest rates. The following section is presented to provide a
    discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations
    in interest rates.

We historically borrow on our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements to acquire, construct or make loans relating to
    health care and senior housing properties. Then, as market
    conditions dictate, we will issue equity or long-term fixed rate
    debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements.

A change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense
    associated with our fixed rate debt. Interest rate changes,
    however, will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt. A 1%
    increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair
    value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately $36,770,000
    at December 31, 2005 ($28,025,000 at December 31,
    2004). Changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of
    this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash
    flows and earnings, depending on whether the debt is replaced
    with other fixed rate debt, variable rate debt, or equity or
    repaid by the sale of assets.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
    of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
    debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps
    are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we
    utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The
    Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a
    fixed rate of 6.0% and pay a variable rate based on six-month
    LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
    Swaps were reported at their fair values as a $2,211,000 and
    $4,206,000 other asset, respectively. A 1% increase in interest
    rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our Swaps by
    approximately $6,435,000 and $7,382,000 at December 31,
    2005 and 2004. We had no interest rate swap agreements
    outstanding at December 31, 2003.

Our variable rate debt, including our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements, is reflected at fair value. At December 31,
    2005, we had $195,000,000 outstanding related to our variable
    rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances, a 1%
    increase in interest rates would result in increased annual
    interest expense of $1,950,000. At December 31, 2004, we
    had $151,000,000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt
    and assuming no changes in outstanding balances, a 1% increase
    in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual
    interest expense of $1,510,000.

We are subject to risks associated with debt financing,
    including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be
    refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as
    favorable as the terms of current indebtedness. The majority of
    our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual
    agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.
    Accordingly, in the event that we are unable to raise additional
    equity or borrow money because of these limitations, our ability
    to acquire additional properties may be limited.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Accounting
    Policies and Related Matters

Industry

We are a self-administered, equity real estate investment trust
    that invests in health care and senior housing properties, which
    primarily include skilled nursing facilities, independent
    living/continuing care retirement communities, assisted living
    facilities and specialty care facilities.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries after the
    elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
    in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid
    investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

Loans
    Receivable

Loans receivable consist of mortgage loans, construction loans
    and working capital loans. Interest income on loans is
    recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding
    subject to an evaluation of collectibility risks. The mortgage
    loans and construction loans are primarily collateralized by a
    first or second mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage on, or an
    assignment of the partnership interest in, the related
    facilities. Working capital loans are generally either unsecured
    or secured by the operator’s leasehold rights, corporate
    guaranties

and/or

personal guaranties.

Allowance
    for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed
    adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The
    determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly
    evaluation of these loans, including general economic conditions
    and estimated collectibility of loan payments. We evaluate the
    collectibility of our loans receivable based on a combination of
    factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status,
    historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower
    and guarantors and value of the underlying collateral. If such
    factors indicate that there is greater risk of loan charge-offs,
    additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be
    required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information
    and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all
    amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of
    the original loan agreement. Consistent with this definition,
    all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. At
    December 31, 2005, we had loans with outstanding balances
    of $16,770,000 on non-accrual status ($35,918,000 at
    December 31, 2004). To the extent circumstances improve and
    the risk of collectibility is diminished, we will return these
    loans to full accrual status. While a loan is on non-accrual
    status, any cash receipts are applied against the outstanding
    balance.



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Real
    Property Owned

The cost of our real property is allocated to land, buildings,
    improvements and intangibles in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business
    Combinations. The allocation of the acquisition costs of
    properties is based on appraisals commissioned from independent
    real estate appraisal firms. Substantially all of the properties
    owned by us are leased under operating leases and are recorded
    at cost. These properties are depreciated on a straight-line
    basis over their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to
    40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for
    improvements. The net book value of long-lived assets is
    reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine
    if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be
    impaired or that the depreciable life may need to be changed. We
    consider external factors relating to each asset. If these
    external factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of
    the asset over the remaining depreciation period indicate that
    the asset will not be recoverable, the carrying value may be
    reduced to the estimated fair market value. The leases generally
    extend for a minimum seven-year period and provide for payment
    of all taxes, insurance and maintenance by the tenants. Prior to
    June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual
    rental escalators, which are generally recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the minimum lease period subject to an
    evaluation of collectibility risks. This income is greater than
    the amount of cash received during the first half of the lease
    term. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure
    contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon
    changes in the Consumer Price Index

and/or

changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenants’
    properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line
    rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. We
    recognized $4,274,000 and $922,500 of contingent rental income
    for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. We did not recognize any contingent rental income
    for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Capitalization
    of Construction Period Interest

We capitalize interest costs associated with funds used to
    finance the construction of properties owned directly by us. The
    amount capitalized is based upon the balance outstanding during
    the construction period using the rate of interest which
    approximates our cost of financing. We capitalized interest
    costs of $665,000, $875,000, and $1,535,000, during 2005, 2004
    and 2003, respectively, related to construction of real property
    owned by us. Our interest expense reflected in the consolidated
    statements of income has been reduced by the amounts capitalized.

Deferred
    Loan Expenses

Deferred loan expenses are costs incurred by us in connection
    with the issuance and amendments of short-term and long-term
    debt. We amortize these costs over the term of the debt using
    the straight-line method, which approximates the interest yield
    method.

Equity
    Investments

We had an investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P., a
    property group that specializes in the financing, through sale
    and leaseback transactions, of nursing and care homes located in
    the United Kingdom. This investment was accounted for using the
    equity method of accounting because we had the ability to
    exercise significant influence, but not control, over the
    investee due to our 31% ownership interest. In October 2003, we
    sold our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P.
    generating a net gain of $902,000.



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Other equity investments, which consist of investments in
    private and public companies for which we do not have the
    ability to exercise influence, are accounted for under the cost
    method. Under the cost method of accounting, investments in
    private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value, distributions of earnings and additional
    investments. For investments in public companies that have
    readily determinable fair market values, we classify our equity
    investments as

available-for-sale

and, accordingly, record these investments at their fair market
    values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income, a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. These investments represent a minimal
    ownership interest in these companies.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

For fiscal year 2003, the functional currency of our investment
    in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P. was the local currency. The
    income and expenses of the entity were translated into
    U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the
    reporting period to derive our equity earnings. Translation
    adjustments were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity. As
    noted above, we sold this investment in October 2003.

Transaction
    Fees

Transaction fees are earned by us for our agreement to provide
    direct and standby financing to, and credit enhancement for,
    owners and operators of health care and senior housing
    properties. We amortize transaction fees over the initial fixed
    term of the lease, the loan or the construction period related
    to such investments.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

Accumulated other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains
    or losses on our equity investments and foreign currency
    translation adjustments. Accumulated unrealized gains and losses
    totaled $0, $1,000 and $1,000 at December 31, 2005, 2004
    and 2003, respectively, and is included as a component of
    stockholders’ equity.

Fair
    Value of Derivative Instruments

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may or
    may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge
    interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on
    our policy to match our variable rate investments with
    comparable borrowings, but are also based on the general trend
    in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of
    the future volatility of interest rates.

In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement No. 138, Accounting
    for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
    Activities, which amends Statement No. 133, Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Statement
    No. 133, as amended, requires companies to record
    derivatives at fair market value on the balance sheet as assets
    or liabilities.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
    of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
    debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps
    are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we
    utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement
    No. 133, as amended. The Swaps are with highly rated
    counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 6.0% and pay
    a variable rate based on six-month LIBOR plus a spread. The
    hedging arrangement is considered highly effective and, as such,
    changes in the Swaps’ fair values exactly offset the
    corresponding changes in the fair value of senior unsecured
    notes and, as a result, the changes in fair value do not result
    in an impact on net income. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    the Swaps were reported at their fair value of $2,211,000 and
    $4,206,000, respectively, in other assets with an offsetting
    adjustment to the underlying senior unsecured notes. For the
    years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we generated
    $972,000 and $1,770,000, respectively, of savings related to the
    Swaps that was recorded as a reduction in interest expense. We
    had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding at
    December 31, 2003.



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
    instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are estimated by a
    third party consultant, which utilizes pricing models that
    consider forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts
    and the recognition of such amounts are subject to significant
    estimates that may change in the future.

Net
    Income Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
    of shares outstanding for the period adjusted for non-vested
    shares of restricted stock. The computation of diluted earnings
    per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that
    the number of shares is increased to include the number of
    additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
    potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

Federal
    Income Tax

No provision has been made for federal income taxes since we
    have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust
    under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
    and we believe that we have met the requirements for
    qualification as such for each taxable year. See Note 11.

New
    Accounting Standards

We adopted the fair value-based method of accounting for
    share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the
    prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148,
    Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.
    Currently, we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model
    to estimate the value of stock option grants and expect to
    continue to use this acceptable option valuation model upon the
    required adoption of Statement of 123(R) on January 1,
    2006. Because Statement 123(R) must be applied not only to
    new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully
    vested on the effective date of Statement 123(R), and
    because we adopted Statement 123 using the prospective
    transition method (which applied only to awards granted,
    modified or settled after the adoption date of
    Statement 123), compensation cost for some previously
    granted awards that were not recognized under Statement 123
    will be recognized under Statement 123(R). Additionally, we
    amortize compensation cost for share based payments to the date
    that the awards become fully vested or to the expected
    retirement date, if sooner. Effective with the adoption of
    Statement 123(R), we will begin recognizing compensation
    cost to the date the awards become fully vested or to the
    retirement eligible date, if sooner. Had we adopted
    Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that
    standard would have approximated the impact of
    Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma
    net income and earnings per share in Note 9. We expect that
    the adoption of Statement 123(R) will increase compensation
    cost by approximately $1,287,000 for 2006 as a result of
    amortizing share based awards to the retirement eligible date.

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform

During the year ended December 31, 2004, it was determined

    not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge
    of $314,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated

Borrowings
    Under Lines of Credit Arrangements and Related Items

We have an unsecured credit arrangement with a consortium of ten
    banks providing for a revolving line of credit (“revolving
    credit”) in the amount of $500,000,000, which expires on
    June 22, 2008 (with the ability to extend for one year at
    our discretion if we are in compliance with all covenants). The
    agreement specifies that borrowings under the revolving credit
    are subject to interest payable in periods no longer than three
    months at either the agent bank’s prime rate of interest or
    the applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate, at our option
    (5.387% at December 31, 2005). The applicable margin is
    based on our ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.9% at
    December 31, 2005. In addition, we pay a facility fee
    annually to each bank based on the bank’s commitment under
    the revolving credit facility. The facility fee depends on our
    ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.225%
    at December 31, 2005. We also pay an annual agent’s
    fee of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the
    agreement. We have another unsecured line of credit arrangement
    with a bank for a total of $40,000,000, which expires
    May 31, 2006. Borrowings under this line of credit are
    subject to interest at either the bank’s prime rate of
    interest (7.25% at December 31, 2005) or 1.3% over
    LIBOR interest rate, at our option. Principal is due upon
    expiration of the agreement.

We have $1,198,278,000 of senior unsecured notes with annual
    interest rates ranging from 5.88% to 8.00%. The carrying amounts
    of the senior unsecured notes represent the par value of
    $1,194,830,000 adjusted for any unamortized premiums or
    discounts and other basis adjustments related to hedging the
    debt with derivative instruments. See Note 1 for further
    discussion regarding derivative instruments.

We have 31 mortgage loans totaling $107,540,000, collateralized
    by owned properties with annual interest rates ranging from
    5.80% to 8.50%. The carrying values of the properties securing
    the mortgage loans totaled $167,230,000 at December 31,
    2005.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require
    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth
    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
    create liens and make investments or acquisitions.

Stock
    Incentive Plans

Our 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizes up to
    2,200,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the
    discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. The 2005 Plan replaced the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan
    and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The options
    granted to officers and key employees under the 1995 Plan
    continue to vest through 2015 and expire ten years from the date
    of grant. Our non-employee directors, officers and key employees
    are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan
    allows for the issuance of, among other things, stock options,
    restricted stock, deferred stock units and dividend equivalent
    rights. There were no dividend equivalent rights outstanding
    under the 1995 Plan for 2003.

Unamortized restricted stock represents the unamortized value of
    restricted stock granted to employees and non-employee directors
    prior to January 1, 2003. Expense related to these grants,
    which is recognized as the shares vest based on the market value
    at the date of the award, totaled $728,000, $949,000 and
    $1,182,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
    2003, respectively.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure, which
    we are required to adopt for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2002, with transition provisions for certain
    matters. Statement 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123,
    Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative
    methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
    value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee
    compensation. In addition, Statement 148 amends the
    disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require
    prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
    statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
    employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
    reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we commenced
    recognizing compensation expense in accordance with
    Statement 123 on a prospective basis. Accumulated
    compensation expense related to stock options represents the
    amount of amortized compensation costs related to stock options
    awarded to employees and directors subsequent to January 1,
    2003.

Preferred
    Stock

In July 2003, we closed a public offering of
    4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation
    value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly
    in arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity,
    may be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per
    share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to the
    redemption date, on or after July 9, 2008. A portion of the
    proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all
    3,000,000 shares of our 8.875% Series B Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock on July 15, 2003, at a
    redemption price of $25.00 per share plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
    Topic D-42, the costs to issue the Series B Preferred Stock
    were recorded as a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2,790,000,
    or $0.06 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2003 to
    reduce net income available to common stockholders.

In September 2003, we issued 1,060,000 shares of 6%
    Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred
    Stock as partial consideration for an acquisition of assets by
    the Company, with the shares valued at $26,500,000 for such
    purposes. The shares were issued to Southern Assisted Living,
    Inc. and certain of its stockholders without registration in
    reliance upon the federal statutory exemption of
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The
    shares have a liquidation value of $25.00 per share.
    Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock,
    which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us at a
    redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends on such shares to the redemption date, on or
    after August 15, 2008. The preferred shares are convertible
    into common stock at a conversion price of $32.66 per share
    at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2005,
    certain holders of our Series E Preferred Stock converted

Income
    Taxes and Distributions

To qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income
    tax purposes, 90% of taxable income (including 100% of capital
    gains) must be distributed to stockholders. Real estate
    investment trusts that do not distribute a certain amount of
    current year taxable income in the current year are also subject
    to a 4% federal excise tax. The principal differences between
    undistributed net income for federal income tax purposes and
    financial statement purposes are the recognition of
    straight-line rent for reporting purposes, differing useful
    lives and depreciation methods for real property and the
    provision for loan losses for reporting purposes versus bad debt
    expense for tax purposes.

Cash distributions paid to common stockholders, for federal
    income tax purposes, are as follows:

Commitments
    and Contingencies

We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit
    of certain insurance companies that provide workers’
    compensation insurance to one of our tenants. Our obligation
    under the letter of credit matures in 2009. At December 31,
    2005, our obligation under the letter of credit was $2,450,000.

At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding construction
    financings of $3,906,000 for leased properties and were
    committed to providing additional financing of approximately
    $36,519,000 to complete construction. At December 31, 2005,
    we had contingent purchase obligations totaling $44,930,000.
    These contingent purchase obligations primarily relate to
    deferred acquisition fundings and capital improvements. Deferred
    acquisition fundings are contingent upon an operator satisfying
    certain conditions such as payment coverage and value tests.
    Amounts due from the tenant are increased to reflect the
    additional investment in the property.

At December 31, 2005, we had operating lease obligations of
    $14,257,000 relating to Company office space, six assisted
    living facilities and three skilled nursing facilities. We
    incurred rental expense relating to our Company office space of
    $283,000, $292,000 and $348,000 for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Regarding
    the facility leases, we have sublease agreements with certain of
    our operators that require the operators to reimburse us for our
    monthly operating lease obligations. At December 31, 2005,
    aggregate future minimum rentals to be received under these
    noncancelable subleases totaled $14,185,000.

At December 31, 2005, future minimum lease payments due

Disclosure
    about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it
    is practicable to estimate that value.

Mortgage Loans Receivable

— The fair value
    of all mortgage loans receivable is estimated by discounting the
    estimated future cash flows using the current rates at which
    similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit
    ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

Working Capital Loans and Construction
    Loans

— The carrying amount is a reasonable
    estimate of fair value based on the interest rates received,
    which approximates current market rates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The carrying
    amount approximates fair value.

Equity Investments

— Equity investments
    are recorded at their fair market value.

Borrowings Under Lines of Credit
    Arrangements

— The carrying amount of the
    lines of credit arrangements approximates fair value because the
    borrowings are interest rate adjustable.

Senior Unsecured Notes

— The fair value of
    the senior unsecured notes payable was estimated by discounting
    the estimated future cash flows using the current borrowing rate
    available to the Company for similar debt.

Mortgage Loans Payable

— Mortgage loans
    payable is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the
    interest rates paid, which approximates current market rates.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

— Our
    interest rate swap agreements are recorded as assets or
    liabilities on the balance sheet at fair market value. Fair
    market value is estimated by a third party consultant, which
    utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and
    discount rates.

Discontinued
    Operations

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
    Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2001. We adopted the
    standard effective January 1, 2002.

One assisted living facility was held for sale as of
    December 31, 2005 and was sold during February 2006. During
    the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, we sold
    properties with carrying values of $61,316,000, $37,710,000 and
    $88,098,000 for net gains of $4,139,000, net losses of $143,000,
    and net gains of $3,227,000, respectively. In accordance with
    Statement No. 144, we have reclassified the income and
    expenses attributable to these properties to discontinued
    operations. Expenses include an allocation of interest expense
    based on property carrying values and our weighted average cost
    of debt. The following illustrates the reclassification impact
    of Statement No. 144 as a result of classifying the
    properties as discontinued operations (in thousands):

    Plan, eligible employees may make contributions, and we may make
    matching contributions and a profit sharing contribution. Our
    contributions to this 401(k) Plan totaled $337,000, $289,000 and
    $206,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”), a non-qualified defined benefit pension
    plan, which provides certain executive officers with
    supplemental deferred retirement benefits. The SERP provides an
    opportunity for participants to receive retirement benefits that
    cannot be paid under our tax-qualified plans because of the
    restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended. Benefits are based on compensation and length
    of service and the SERP is unfunded. No contributions by the
    Company are anticipated for the 2005 fiscal year. No benefit
    payments are expected to occur during the next five fiscal years
    and total $778,000 during the succeeding five fiscal years. We
    use a December 31 measurement date for the SERP. The
    accrued liability on our balance sheet for the SERP was
    $1,032,000 at December 31, 2005 ($703,000 at
    December 31, 2004).

    Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the

    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the
    end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
    evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective as of the end of the period covered by this
    report.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
    or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005 based on the criteria established by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    in a report entitled Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Based on that
    assessment, management believes that the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is effective as of
    December 31, 2005.

The registered independent public accounting firm of
    Ernst & Young LLP, as auditors of the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation
    report on management’s assessment of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) occurred
    during the fourth quarter of the one-year period covered by this
    report that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Stockholders and Directors

Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting, that Health Care REIT, Inc. maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the COSO criteria). Health Care REIT Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
    assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Health Care
    REIT, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
    opinion, Health Care REIT, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Health Care REIT, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2005 of Health Care REIT, Inc. and our report
    dated February 22, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.
