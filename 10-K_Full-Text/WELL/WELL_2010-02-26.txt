ANNUAL REPORT



PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Health Care REIT, Inc., an S&P 500 company with
    headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, is a real estate investment trust
    (“REIT”) that invests in senior housing and health
    care real estate. We also provide an extensive array of property
    management and development services. As of December 31,
    2009, our broadly diversified portfolio consisted of 590
    properties in 39 states. Founded in 1970, we were the first
    real estate investment trust to invest exclusively in health
    care facilities. More information is available on the Internet
    at www.hcreit.com.

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and
    enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash
    dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase
    dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual
    increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To
    meet these objectives, we invest in the full spectrum of senior
    housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment
    portfolio by property type, operator/tenant and geographic
    location.

Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we
    believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations, meet
    debt service obligations (both principal and interest), make
    dividend distributions and complete construction projects in
    process. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to finance
    future investments. New investments are generally funded from
    temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from
    sales of real property. Our investments generate internal cash
    from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans
    receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which
    replaces funds drawn under the unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, has historically been provided through a
    combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity
    securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.

References herein to “we,” “us,”
    “our” or the “Company” refer to Health Care
    REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless specifically noted
    otherwise.

Property
    Types

Our property types include investment properties and medical
    office buildings. Under the investment property segment, we
    invest in senior housing and health care real estate through
    acquisition and financing of primarily single tenant properties.
    Properties acquired are typically leased under

triple-net

leases. We are not involved in the management of our investment
    properties. Our primary investment property types include
    independent living/



continuing care retirement communities, assisted living
    facilities, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. The
    medical office building segment is primarily self-managed and
    consists of health care related properties acquired or developed
    for the medical profession. The medical office building leases
    have lease terms that typically include fixed increasers and
    operating expense reimbursement. Our properties include
    stand-alone facilities that provide one level of service,
    combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service,
    and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of
    services. The following is a summary of our various property
    types.

Independent
    Living/Continuing Care Retirement Communities

These communities may include one or more of the following
    property types.

Independent Living Facilities.

Independent
    living facilities are age-restricted, multifamily properties
    with central dining facilities that provide residents access to
    meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service,
    transportation and social and recreational activities.

Continuing Care Retirement
    Communities.

Continuing care retirement
    communities include a combination of detached homes, an
    independent living facility, an assisted living facility

and/or

a
    skilled nursing facility on one campus. These communities are
    appealing to residents because there is no need for relocating
    when health and medical needs change. Resident payment plans
    vary, but can include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental
    fees. Many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance
    fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health
    services.

Early Stage Senior Housing.

Early stage senior
    housing communities contain primarily for-sale single-family
    homes, townhomes, cluster homes, mobile homes

and/or

condominiums with no specialized services. These communities are
    typically restricted or targeted to adults at least
    55 years of age or older. Residents generally lead an
    independent lifestyle. Communities may include amenities such as
    a clubhouse, golf course and recreational spaces.

Assisted
    Living Facilities

Assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties
    that provide the same services as independent living facilities,
    but also provide supportive care from trained employees to
    residents who require assistance with activities of daily
    living, including management of medications, bathing, dressing,
    toileting, ambulating and eating.

Alzheimer’s/Dementia Care
    Facilities.

Certain assisted living facilities
    may include state licensed settings that specialize in caring
    for those afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease

and/or

similar forms of dementia.

Skilled
    Nursing Facilities

Skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental
    properties where the majority of individuals require

24-hour

nursing

and/or

medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for
    Medicaid

and/or

Medicare reimbursement.

Hospitals

Our hospitals generally include acute care hospitals, inpatient
    rehabilitation hospitals, and long-term acute care hospitals.
    Acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and
    outpatient services, including, but not limited to, surgery,
    rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories. Inpatient
    rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient services for patients
    with intensive rehabilitation needs. Long-term acute care
    hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex
    medical conditions that require more intensive care, monitoring
    or emergency support than is available in most skilled nursing
    facilities.

Medical
    Office Buildings

The medical office building portfolio consists of health care
    related buildings that include physician offices, ambulatory
    surgery centers, diagnostic facilities or labs. Our portfolio
    has a strong affiliation with health systems:



approximately 75% of the buildings are either located on campus
    or affiliated with hospitals through a satellite location.

Investments

We invest in senior housing and health care real estate. We
    diversify our investment portfolio by property type,
    operator/tenant and geographic location. In determining whether
    to invest in a property, we focus on the following: (1) the
    experience of the obligor’s management team; (2) the
    historical and projected financial and operational performance
    of the property; (3) the credit of the obligor;
    (4) the security for the lease or loan; and (5) the
    capital committed to the property by the obligor. We conduct
    market research and analysis for all potential investments. In
    addition, we review the value of all properties, the interest
    rates and covenant requirements of any debt to be assumed and
    the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that
    is not to be assumed.

We monitor our investments through a variety of methods
    determined by the type of property. Our asset management process
    for investment properties generally includes review of monthly
    financial statements and other operating data for each property,
    periodic review of obligor creditworthiness, periodic property
    inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to
    licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other
    collateral. Our internal property management division actively
    manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio with
    a comprehensive process including tenant relations, tenant lease
    expirations, the mix of health service providers,
    hospital/health system relationships, property performance,
    capital improvement needs and market conditions among other
    things. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a
    proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific
    data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain
    industry trends and risks.

Through asset management and research, we evaluate the operating
    environment in each property’s market to determine whether
    payment risk is likely to increase. When we identify
    unacceptable levels of payment risk, we seek to mitigate,
    eliminate or transfer the risk. We categorize the risk as
    obligor, property or market risk. For obligor risk, we typically
    find a substitute operator/tenant to run the property. For
    property risk, we usually work with the operator/tenant to
    institute property-level management changes to address the risk.
    Finally, for market risk, we often encourage an obligor to
    change its capital structure, including refinancing the property
    or raising additional equity. Through these asset management and
    research efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early
    stage to address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the
    collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new
    investments will be available in the future with spreads over
    our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to
    our stockholders.

Segment
    Reporting

Our business consists of two business segments —
    investment properties and medical office buildings. For
    additional information regarding business segments, see
    Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements.

Investment
    Properties

Real Property.

Our investment properties are
    those in which we do not participate in the management of the
    property and are primarily land, building, improvements and
    related rights that are leased to operators under long-term
    operating leases. The net value of our investment properties
    (excluding construction in progress) aggregated approximately
    $3,795,765,000 at December 31, 2009. The leases generally
    have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain
    one or more five to

15-year

renewal options. Most of our rents are received under

triple-net

leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional
    charges incurred in the operation of the leased property. The
    tenants are required to repair, rebuild and maintain the leased
    properties. Substantially all of these operating leases are
    designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent
    structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial
    lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental
    income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is
    generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments
    due for the period.

At December 31, 2009, 84% of our investment properties was
    subject to master leases. A master lease is a lease of multiple
    properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement.
    From time to time, we may acquire



additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under
    the master lease. The tenant is required to make one monthly
    payment that represents rent on all the properties that are
    subject to the master lease. Typically, the master lease tenant
    can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew
    the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at
    the same time. This bundling feature benefits us because the
    tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better
    performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with
    respect to the poorer performing properties. This spreads our
    risk among the entire group of properties within the master
    lease. The bundling feature may provide a similar advantage if
    the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy. Subject to certain
    restrictions, a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or
    reject each of its leases. It is our intent that a tenant in
    bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master
    lease as a whole, rather than deciding on a property by property
    basis.

Construction.

We currently provide for the
    construction of properties for tenants as part of long-term
    operating leases. We capitalize certain interest costs
    associated with funds used to pay for the construction of
    properties owned by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the
    amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of
    interest that approximates our cost of financing. Our interest
    expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. We also typically
    charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction
    which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the
    resulting lease. The construction period commences upon funding
    and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the
    applicable property or the end of a specified period. During the
    construction period, we advance funds to the tenants in
    accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require,
    among other things, periodic site visits by a Company
    representative. During the construction period, we generally
    require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment
    and performance bonds

and/or

completion guaranties. At December 31, 2009, we had
    outstanding construction investments of $435,334,000 and were
    committed to providing additional funds of approximately
    $184,848,000 to complete construction for investment properties.

Real Estate Loans.

Our real estate loans are
    typically structured to provide us with interest income,
    principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally
    secured by a first, second or third mortgage lien, leasehold
    mortgage, corporate guaranties

and/or

personal guaranties. At December 31, 2009, we had
    outstanding real estate loans of $427,363,000. The interest
    yield averaged approximately 7.96% per annum on our outstanding
    real estate loan balances. Our yield on real estate loans
    depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest
    rate, average principal amount outstanding during the term of
    the loan and any interest rate adjustments. The real estate
    loans outstanding at December 31, 2009 are generally
    subject to three to

20-year

terms with principal amortization schedules

and/or

balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the
    end of the term. Typically, real estate loans are
    cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate
    loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor
    and its affiliates.

Medical
    Office Buildings

Our medical office building portfolio is primarily self-managed
    and consists principally of multi-tenant properties leased to
    health care providers. Our leases have favorable lease terms
    that typically include fixed increasers and some form of
    operating expense reimbursement by the tenant. As of
    December 31, 2009 87% of our portfolio included leases with
    full pass thru, 10% with a partial expense reimbursement
    (modified gross) and 3% with no expense reimbursement (gross).
    Our medical office building leases are non-cancellable operating
    leases that have a weighted average remaining term of six years
    at December 31, 2009 and are normally credit enhanced by
    guaranties

and/or

letters of credit. The net value of our medical office buildings
    (excluding construction in progress) aggregated approximately
    $1,405,843,000 at December 31, 2009. We also had
    outstanding construction investments of $21,498,000 and expected
    to provide additional funds of approximately $29,097,000 to
    complete construction for medical office buildings.

Development
    Services Group

Through our subsidiary, HCN Development Services Group, Inc.
    (“DSG”), we provide services such as property
    development, facility and medical equipment planning and
    implementation services to health care systems, physician groups
    and third party medical property owners. Formerly known as
    Hospital Affiliates Development Corporation or “HADC,”
    DSG develops and constructs new

“build-to-suit”

and multi-tenant facilities



for us, and in some instances, for third parties who are
    expected to develop long-term relationships with the Company.

Equity
    Investments

Equity investments at December 31, 2009 and 2008 include an
    investment in a public company that has a readily determinable
    fair market value. We classify this equity investment as

available-for-sale

and, accordingly, record this investment at its fair market
    value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income, a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. Equity investments at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 also include an investment in a
    private company. We do not have the ability to exercise
    influence over the company, so the investment is accounted for
    under the cost method. Under the cost method of accounting,
    investments in private companies are carried at cost and are
    adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value, return of capital and additional
    investments. These equity investments represented a minimal
    ownership interest in these companies. Additionally, equity
    investments at December 31, 2009 include an investment in
    an unconsolidated joint venture.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint
    Ventures.

Investments in entities which we do not
    consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over operating and financial policies are
    reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity
    method of accounting, our share of the investee’s earnings
    or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations.
    The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated
    joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint
    venture interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior
    to the sale of interests in the joint venture. We evaluate our
    equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison
    of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to
    its carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated
    fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is

other-than-temporary,

an impairment is recorded.

Borrowing
    Policies

We utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund the purchase
    of new properties and to provide loan financing. Our debt and
    equity levels are determined by management to maintain a
    conservative credit profile. Generally, we intend to issue
    unsecured, fixed rate public debt with long-term maturities to
    approximate the maturities on our leases and loans. For
    short-term purposes, we may borrow on our unsecured line of
    credit arrangement. We replace these borrowings with long-term
    capital such as senior unsecured notes, common stock or
    preferred stock. When terms are deemed favorable, we may invest
    in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. In
    addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged
    properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties
    acquired on a leveraged basis. It is our intent to limit secured
    indebtedness. In our agreements with our lenders, we are subject
    to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured
    indebtedness.

Competition

We compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate
    partnerships, private equity and hedge fund investors, banks,
    insurance companies, finance/investment companies,
    government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond
    funds, health care operators, developers and other investors in
    the acquisition, development, leasing and financing of health
    care and senior housing properties. Some of our competitors are
    larger with greater resources and lower costs of capital than
    us. Increased competition inhibits our ability to identify and
    successfully complete investments. We compete for investments
    based on a number of factors including rates, financings
    offered, underwriting criteria and reputation. Our ability to
    successfully compete is also impacted by economic and population
    trends, availability of acceptable investment opportunities, our
    ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms, availability
    and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs and new
    and existing laws and regulations.

The operators/tenants of our properties compete on a local and
    regional basis with operators/tenants of properties that provide
    comparable services. Operators/tenants compete for patients and
    residents based on a number of factors including quality of
    care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, services
    offered, family preferences, physicians, staff and price. We
    also face competition from other health care facilities for
    tenants, such as physicians and other health care providers that
    provide comparable facilities and services.

Certain
    Government Regulations

Health
    Law Matters — Generally

Typically, operators of assisted living and independent living
    facilities do not receive significant funding from governmental
    programs and are regulated by the applicable state, not the
    federal government. Operators of skilled nursing facilities and
    hospitals do receive significant funding from governmental
    programs and are subject to federal and state laws that regulate
    the type and quality of the medical

and/or

nursing care provided, ancillary services (e.g., respiratory,
    occupational, physical and infusion therapies), qualifications
    of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy
    of the physical plant and equipment, reimbursement and rate
    setting and operating policies. In addition, as described below,
    operators are subject to extensive laws and regulations
    pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including kickbacks,
    physician self-referrals and false claims. Hospitals, physician
    group practice clinics, and other health care providers that
    operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state
    and local licensure, certification, and inspection laws and
    regulations. Our tenants’ failure to comply with any of
    these laws could result in loss of accreditation, denial of
    reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or
    decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care
    programs, loss of license or closure of the facility.

Licensing
    and Certification

The primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities
    are state licensing laws. In granting and renewing these
    licenses, the regulatory authorities consider numerous factors
    relating to a property’s physical plant and operations
    including, but not limited to, admission and discharge standards
    and staffing and training. A decision to grant or renew a
    license is also affected by a property’s record with
    respect to patient and consumer rights and medication guidelines
    and rules. Certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to
    or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or
    upfront fee, a portion of which may be refundable. These
    entrance fee communities are subject to significant state
    regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each
    facility’s financial condition, establishment and
    monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial
    restrictions, the right of residents to cancel their contracts
    within a specified period of time, lien rights in favor of
    residents, restrictions on change of ownership and similar
    matters. Such oversight and the rights of residents within these



entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or
    operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may
    adversely affect us.

Skilled nursing facilities are subject to a variety of licensure
    and certificate of need (“CON”) laws and regulations.
    CON laws in those states that have them generally require a
    facility to demonstrate the need for constructing a new
    facility, adding beds or expanding an existing facility,
    investing in major capital equipment or adding new services,
    changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed
    facility, or terminating services that have been previously
    approved through the CON process. The CON laws and regulations
    may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or
    expand an existing facility’s size or services. In
    addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to
    transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a
    new operator. If we have to replace a barred property operator
    (as discussed below), our ability to replace the operator may be
    affected by CON rules and policies governing changes in control.

With respect to licensure, generally our skilled nursing
    facilities and hospitals are required to be licensed and
    certified for participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other
    federal health care programs. This generally requires license
    renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or bi-annual basis.
    The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required
    license or regulatory approval or the failure to correct serious
    survey deficiencies identified in compliance surveys could
    prevent them from continuing operations at a property. In
    addition, if a property is found out of compliance with the
    conditions of participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other
    health care programs, the property may be barred from
    participation in government reimbursement programs. Any of these
    occurrences may impair the ability of our operators to meet
    their obligations to us. If we have to replace a barred property
    operator, our ability to replace the operator may be affected by
    federal and state rules and policies governing changes in
    control. This may result in payment delays, an inability to find
    a replacement operator, a significant working capital commitment
    from us to a new operator or other difficulties.

Reimbursement

Assisted Living Facilities.

Approximately 21%
    of our rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009
    were attributable to assisted living facilities. The majority of
    the revenues received by the operators of our assisted living
    facilities are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue
    source is primarily Medicaid under certain waiver programs. As a
    part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”)
    of 1981, Congress established a waiver program enabling some
    states to offer Medicaid reimbursement to assisted living
    facilities as an alternative to institutional long-term care
    services. The provisions of OBRA and the subsequent OBRA Acts of
    1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical
    Medicaid requirements to develop cost-effective alternatives to
    long-term care, including Medicaid payments for assisted living
    and home health. At December 31, 2009, four of our 22
    assisted living operators received Medicaid reimbursement
    pursuant to Medicaid waiver programs. For the twelve months
    ended September 30, 2009, approximately 9% of the revenues
    at our assisted living facilities were from Medicaid
    reimbursement. There can be no guarantee that a state Medicaid
    program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain
    its waiver status.

Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and
    are largely determined by local market conditions and operating
    costs. Generally, facilities receive a higher payment per day
    for a private pay resident than for a Medicaid beneficiary who
    requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid
    reimbursement varies from state to state. Thus, the revenues
    generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be
    adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level and changes in
    Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels. In addition, a
    state could lose its Medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted
    to utilize Medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living
    services. Changes in revenues could in turn have a material
    adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its
    obligations to us.

Skilled Nursing Facilities and
    Hospitals.

Skilled nursing facilities and
    hospitals typically receive most of their revenues from Medicare
    and Medicaid, with the balance representing private pay,
    including private insurance. Consequently, changes in federal or
    state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an
    operator’s ability to cover its expenses, including our
    rent or debt service. Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals
    are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews and other
    audits by federal and state authorities. A review or audit of
    claims of a property operator could result in recoupments,
    denials or delays of payments in the future, which could have a
    material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet
    its obligations to us. Due to the significant judgments and



estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting, no assurance
    can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by
    our property operators for potential adjustments to
    reimbursements for payor settlements. Due to budgetary
    constraints, governmental payors may limit or reduce payments to
    skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. As a result of
    government reimbursement programs being subject to such
    budgetary pressures and legislative and administrative actions,
    an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us may be
    significantly impaired.

Medicare Reimbursement and Skilled Nursing
    Facilities.

For the twelve months ended
    September 30, 2009, approximately 30% of the revenues at
    our skilled nursing facilities (which comprised 31% of our
    rental revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2009) were from Medicare reimbursement. Skilled nursing
    facilities are reimbursed under the skilled nursing facility
    prospective payment system. This type of reimbursement program
    puts facilities at risk to the extent that their costs exceed
    the fixed payments under the prospective payment system. In
    addition, there is a risk that payments under the prospective
    payment system may be set too low, which could result in
    immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities
    and cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection. Skilled
    nursing facilities have had these types of difficulties since
    the implementation of the prospective payment system.

Skilled nursing facilities received a full Medicare market
    basket update of 3.4% for federal fiscal year 2009. The Centers
    for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), an
    agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
    has announced that skilled nursing facilities will receive an
    additional 1.1% net decrease in Medicare payments for fiscal
    year 2010. This 1.1% net decrease is the result of a 3.3%
    decrease in payments due to recalibration of the case-mix
    indexes combined with a 2.2% increase in payments through
    “market basket” changes for fiscal year 2010.
    Section 5008 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 directs
    the Secretary (as defined in that statute) to conduct a
    demonstration program beginning January 1, 2008 assessing
    the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in
    a variety of post-acute care settings, including skilled nursing
    facilities. The outcome of that demonstration program could lead
    to changes in Medicare coverage and reimbursement for post-acute
    care. It is not known how either the demonstration program, or
    any other changes in Medicare reimbursement or regulatory
    obligations that might be proposed, might impact tenants of the
    Company’s properties.

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated caps on Medicare
    reimbursement for certain therapy services. However, Congress
    imposed various moratoriums on the implementation of those caps.
    For 2010, the annual payment cap of $1,860 per patient applies
    to occupational therapy and a separate $1,860 cap applies to
    speech and physical therapy. Congress has permitted patients
    exceeding the cap to obtain additional Medicare coverage through
    a waiver program if the therapy is deemed medically necessary.
    The waiver program was historically extended, most recently by
    the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008
    through December 31, 2009. Health care reform bills
    considered by Congress in 2009 would have extended this waiver
    program through at least 2010, but due to Congressional
    inactivity these provisions were not passed before the waiver
    expired on December 31, 2009. Patients will therefore need
    to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the
    caps. If patients are unable to satisfy their

out-of-pocket

cost responsibility to reimburse an operator for services
    rendered, the operator’s ability to meet its obligations to
    us could be adversely impacted.

Medicare Reimbursement and Hospitals.

For the
    twelve months ended September 30, 2009, approximately 53%
    of the revenues at our hospitals (which comprised 8% of our
    rental revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2009) were from Medicare. Hospitals generally are
    reimbursed by Medicare under the diagnosis related group
    prospective payment system reimbursement methodology for
    inpatient hospitals, the long-term acute care hospital
    prospective payment system for long-term acute care hospitals or
    the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment
    system. Acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient
    and outpatient services including, but not limited to, surgery,
    rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories. Long-term
    acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients
    with complex medical conditions that require more intensive
    care, monitoring or emergency support than that available in
    most skilled nursing facilities. Inpatient rehabilitation
    facilities provide intensive rehabilitation services in an
    inpatient setting for patients requiring at least three hours of
    rehabilitation services a day.

With respect to Medicare’s diagnosis related
    group/outpatient prospective payment system methodology for
    regular hospitals, reimbursement for inpatient services is made
    on the basis of a fixed, prospective rate based on the principal
    diagnosis of the patient. Hospitals are at risk to the extent
    that their costs in treating a specific case exceed the fixed
    payment. The diagnosis related group reimbursement system was
    changed in 2008, with the expansion of



diagnosis groups from 538 to 745 diagnosis related groups to
    greater reflect severity. One additional diagnosis related group
    was added in 2009, for a new total of 746. It is possible that
    this change in the DRG system will adversely impact
    reimbursement for some of our hospitals. In some cases, a
    hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the
    hospital’s losses exceed a threshold.

Medicaid Reimbursement.

Medicaid is a major
    payor source for residents in our skilled nursing facilities and
    hospitals. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2009,
    approximately 50% of the revenues of our skilled nursing
    facilities and 3% of the revenues of our hospitals were
    attributable to Medicaid payments. The federal government and
    the states share responsibility for financing Medicaid. The
    federal matching rate, known as the Federal Medical Assistance
    Percentage, varies by state based on relative per capita income,
    but is at least 50% in all states. On average, Medicaid is the
    largest component of total state spending, representing
    approximately 21% of total state spending. The percentage of
    Medicaid dollars used for long-term care varies from state to
    state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and
    eligibility requirements. Within certain federal guidelines,
    states have a wide range of discretion to determine eligibility
    and reimbursement methodology. Many states reimburse long-term
    care facilities using fixed daily rates, which are applied
    prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs
    incurred in providing patient care. Reasonable costs typically
    include allowances for staffing, administrative and general, and
    property and equipment (e.g., real estate taxes, depreciation
    and fair rental).

In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of
    providing skilled nursing services. Certain states are
    attempting to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid expenditures
    by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits. At
    the beginning of state fiscal year 2010, states in which we have
    skilled nursing property investments held rates flat on average
    for fiscal year 2010. Our skilled nursing portfolio’s
    average Medicaid rate will likely vary throughout the year as
    states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and
    Medicaid funding. In addition, Medicaid rates may decline if
    revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund
    budgeted expenditures.

The Medicare Part D drug benefit became effective
    January 1, 2006. Nursing home residents dually eligible for
    Medicare (and enrolled in one of the new Part D plans) and
    Medicaid may now enroll and receive reimbursement for drugs
    through Medicare Part D rather than through Medicaid.
    Part D will result in increased administrative
    responsibilities for nursing home operators because enrollment
    in Part D is voluntary and residents have the choice of
    multiple prescription drug plans. Operators may also experience
    increased expenses to the extent that patients’ specific
    prescribed drugs may not be on the Part D drug plan
    formulary for the plan in which specific patients are enrolled.

The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care
    facilities continue to evolve. Federal and state authorities
    have considered and may seek to implement new or modified
    reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health
    care property operations. The impact of any such change, if
    implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our
    skilled nursing and hospital property operations. No assurance
    can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be
    maintained. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that payments
    under a government reimbursement program are currently, or will
    be in the future, sufficient to fully reimburse the property
    operators for their operating and capital expenses. As a result,
    an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us could
    be adversely impacted.

Finally, federal legislative efforts to reform the health care
    industry may have a significant impact on Medicare, Medicaid,
    and private insurance coverage and reimbursement for services
    provided by skilled nursing facilities and other health care
    providers. Any such health care reform could have a substantial
    and material adverse effect on all parties directly or
    indirectly involved in the health care system.

Other
    Related Laws

Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and assisted living or
    CCRC facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to
    federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the
    operations and financial and other arrangements that may be
    entered into by health care providers. Certain of these laws
    prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose
    of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical
    products or services reimbursable by governmental programs.
    Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary
    services and submit to the government valid and accurate
    statements for each service. Still other laws require providers
    to comply with a variety of safety, health and other
    requirements relating to the condition of the licensed



property and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for
    violations of these laws and regulations may include, but are
    not limited to, criminal

and/or

civil
    penalties and fines and a loss of licensure, immediate
    termination of governmental payments, and exclusion from
    eligibility for any governmental reimbursement. In certain
    circumstances, violation of these rules (such as those
    prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one
    property may subject other facilities under common control or
    ownership to sanctions, including exclusion from participation
    in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In the ordinary course of
    its business, a property operator is regularly subjected to
    inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state
    agencies that oversee these laws and regulations.

Each skilled nursing and hospital property (and any assisted
    living or CCRC property that receives Medicaid payments) is
    subject to the federal anti-kickback statute that generally
    prohibits persons from offering, providing, soliciting or
    receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an
    individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which
    payment may be made under a federal health care program such as
    the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Skilled nursing facilities
    and hospitals are also subject to the federal Ethics in Patient
    Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. The
    Stark Law generally prohibits the submission of claims to
    Medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician
    referral for certain designated services and the physician has a
    financial relationship with the health service provider that
    does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial
    relationship under the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions on
    physician self-referrals and submission of claims apply to state
    Medicaid programs. Further, skilled nursing facilities and
    hospitals (and assisted living or CCRC facilities that receive
    Medicaid payments) are subject to substantial financial
    penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the False
    Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the False Claims
    Act’s “whistleblower” provisions. Private
    enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part
    to amendments to the False Claims Act that encourage private
    individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These
    whistleblower suits by private individuals, known as qui tam
    actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and
    former patients, nurses and other employees. Some cases have
    been brought under the federal False Claims Act asserting claims
    for treble damages and up to $11,000 per claim on the basis of
    the alleged failure of a nursing facility to meet applicable
    regulations relating to the operation of the nursing facility.
    Prosecutions, investigations or whistleblower actions could have
    a material adverse effect on a property operator’s
    liquidity, financial condition and results of operations which
    could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its
    obligations to us. Finally, various state false claim and
    anti-kickback laws also may apply to each property operator.
    Violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in
    criminal

and/or

civil
    penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the
    ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us.

Other legislative developments over the past several years,
    including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), have greatly expanded the
    definition of health care fraud and related offenses and
    broadened its scope to include private health care plans in
    addition to government payors. Congress also has greatly
    increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau
    of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General of the
    Department of Health and Human Services to audit, investigate
    and prosecute suspected health care fraud. Moreover, a
    significant portion of the billions in health care fraud
    recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to
    government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation
    and prosecution efforts.

Additionally, other HIPAA provisions and regulations provide for
    communication of health information through standard electronic
    transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health
    information. In order to comply with the regulations, health
    care providers must undergo significant operational and
    technical changes. Operators also face significant financial
    exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of
    medical records and personal, identifiable health information
    about individuals. The Health Information Technology for
    Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act, passed in
    February 2009, modified the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services’ authority to impose civil money penalties for
    HIPAA violations occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH
    directs the HHS Secretary to provide for periodic audits to
    ensure covered entities and their business associates (as that
    term is defined under HIPAA) comply with applicable HITECH
    requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation
    will result in an enforcement action. CMS issued an interim
    Final Rule effective November 2009 which conforms HIPAA
    enforcement regulations to the HITECH Act, increasing the
    maximum penalty to $1.5 million for certain types of
    violations.



In November 2002, CMS began a national Nursing Home Quality
    Initiative (NHQI). Under this initiative, historical survey
    information, the NHQI Pilot Evaluation Report and the NHQI
    Overview is made available to the public on-line. The NHQI
    website provides consumer and provider information regarding the
    quality of care in nursing homes. The data allows consumers,
    providers, states and researchers to compare quality information
    that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their
    residents’ physical and clinical needs. The posted nursing
    home quality measures come from resident assessment data that
    nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified
    intervals during their stay. If the operators of nursing
    facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that
    are comparable or superior to those of their competitors, they
    may lose market share to other facilities, reducing their
    revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental
    payments.

Finally, government investigation and enforcement of health care
    laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and
    is expected to continue. Some of these enforcement actions
    represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application
    of false claims laws. The costs for an operator of a health care
    property associated with both defending such enforcement actions
    and the undertakings in settlement agreements can be substantial
    and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an
    operator to meet its obligations to us.

Environmental
    Laws

A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and
    occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect
    health care facility operations or special medical properties.
    Under various federal, state and local environmental laws,
    ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a
    secured lender (such as the Company) may be liable for the costs
    of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at,
    under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well
    as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic
    substances (including government fines and damages for injuries
    to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required
    remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and
    the owner’s or secured lender’s liability for such
    costs could exceed the value of the property,

and/or

the
    assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence
    of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or
    remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s
    ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such
    property as collateral which, in turn, would reduce revenues.

Taxation

Federal
    Income Tax Considerations

The following summary of the taxation of the Company and the
    material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and
    equity securities is for general information only and is not tax
    advice. This summary does not address all aspects of taxation
    that may be relevant to certain types of holders of stock or
    securities (including, but not limited to, insurance companies,
    tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
    persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging,
    integrated conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a
    straddle, traders in securities that use a

mark-to-market

method of accounting for their securities, investors in
    pass-through entities and foreign corporations and persons who
    are not citizens or residents of the United States).

This summary does not discuss all of the aspects of
    U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in

    addition, this summary does not discuss any state or local
    income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax
    consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal
    income tax law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal
    income tax law, including changes in law or differing
    interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have
    a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax
    consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our
    securities as set forth in this summary. Before you purchase our
    securities, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding
    the particular U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and
    other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our
    securities.

General

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (a
    “REIT”) commencing with our first taxable year. We
    intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as
    a REIT, but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain
    qualified as a REIT for subsequent years. Qualification and
    taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to



meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal
    income tax law with respect to income, assets, distribution
    level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under
    “— Qualification as a REIT.” There can be no
    assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate
    in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified.

In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general, we will
    not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT
    taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to
    stockholders. We may, however, be subject to tax at normal
    corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not
    distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net
    long-term capital gain, stockholders are required to include
    their proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital
    gain in income, but they will receive a refundable credit for
    their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain.

Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to federal income
    and excise tax as follows:

•

To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital
    gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our
    “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject
    to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax
    rates;

•

We may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax”
    (the “AMT”) on certain tax preference items to the
    extent that the AMT exceeds our regular tax;

•

If we have net income from the sale or other disposition of
    “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale
    to customers in the ordinary course of business or other
    non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, such income
    will be taxed at the highest corporate rate;

•

Any net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in
    general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily
    for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other
    than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of
    property due to an involuntary conversion) will be subject to a
    100% tax;

•

If we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95% gross income tests
    (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our qualification
    as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be
    subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross
    income attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross
    income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes
    of the 75% gross income test (discussed below) or (ii) 95%
    of our gross income (90% of our gross income for taxable years
    beginning on or before October 22, 2004) over the
    amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% gross
    income test (discussed below) multiplied by (2) a fraction
    intended to reflect our profitability;

•

If we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of
    (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year,
    (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year
    (other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on)
    and (3) any undistributed taxable income from preceding
    periods, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of
    such required distribution over amounts actually
    distributed; and

•

We will be subject to a 100% tax on the amount of any rents from
    real property, deductions or excess interest paid to us by any
    of our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” that would be
    reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax
    principles in order to more clearly reflect income of the
    taxable REIT subsidiary. See “— Qualification as
    a REIT — Investments in Taxable REIT
    Subsidiaries.”

If we acquire any assets from a corporation, which is or has
    been a “C” corporation, in a carryover basis
    transaction, we could be liable for specified liabilities that
    are inherited from the “C” corporation. A
    “C” corporation is generally defined as a corporation
    that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax.
    If we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the
    ten-year period beginning on the date on which the assets were
    acquired by us, then, to the extent of the assets’
    “built-in gain” (i.e., the excess of the fair market
    value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset, in
    each case determined as of the beginning of the ten-year
    period), we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest
    regular corporate rate applicable. The results described in this
    paragraph with respect to the recognition of built-in gain
    assume that the built-in gain assets, at the time the built-in
    gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction (either
    where a “C” corporation elected REIT status or a REIT
    acquired the assets from a “C” corporation), were not
    treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized.



Qualification
    as a REIT

A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or association:

(1)

which is managed by one or more trustees or directors;

(2)

the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable
    shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;

(3)

which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the
    federal income tax law relating to REITs;

(4)

which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance
    company;

(5)

the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons
    in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first taxable
    year;

(6)

not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is
    owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding its
    first taxable year, directly or indirectly, by or for five or
    fewer individuals (which includes certain entities) (the
    “Five or Fewer Requirement”); and

(7)

which meets certain income and asset tests described below.

Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the
    entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at
    least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or
    during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than
    12 months. For purposes of conditions (5) and (6),
    pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated
    as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception
    in the case of condition (6).

Based on publicly available information, we believe we have
    satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in
    (5) and (6) above. In addition, Article VI of our
    Amended and Restated By-Laws provides for restrictions regarding
    ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are
    intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share
    ownership requirements described in (5) and (6) above.
    These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all
    cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements
    described in (5) and (6) above.

We have complied with, and will continue to comply with,
    regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our
    stockholders requesting information regarding the actual
    ownership of our stock. If, despite sending the annual letters,
    we do not know, or after exercising reasonable diligence would
    not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer
    Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer
    Requirement. If we fail to comply with these regulatory rules,
    we will be subject to a monetary penalty. If our failure to
    comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement, the
    penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply
    were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty
    would be imposed.

We may own a number of properties through wholly owned
    subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified
    REIT subsidiary” if 100% of its stock is owned by a REIT,
    and the REIT does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable
    REIT subsidiary. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” will
    not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets,
    liabilities and items of income, deductions and credits of a
    “qualified REIT subsidiary” will be treated as assets,
    liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT. A
    “qualified REIT subsidiary” is not subject to federal
    income tax, and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified
    REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against
    ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more
    than 10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or
    more than 5% of the value of our total assets, as described
    below under “— Asset Tests.”

If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability company or a
    trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will
    be deemed to own a proportionate share of the
    partnership’s, limited liability company’s or
    trust’s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving
    our share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited
    liability company or trust, and the gross income will retain the
    same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the



partnership, limited liability company or trust. These
    “look-through” rules apply for purposes of the income
    tests and assets tests described below.

Income Tests.

There are two separate
    percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we
    must satisfy for each taxable year.

•

At least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
    directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from
    “rents from real property,” other income from
    investments relating to real property or mortgages on real
    property or certain income from qualified temporary investments.

•

At least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
    directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the
    sources qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from
    dividends (including dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries)
    and interest.

For taxable years beginning on or before October 22, 2004,
    (1) payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap
    agreement, option, futures contract, forward rate agreement or
    any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce
    interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred
    and (2) gain from the sale or other disposition of any such
    investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95% gross
    income test. As to transactions entered into in taxable years
    beginning after October 22, 2004, any of our income from a
    “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is
    entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or
    indirectly, to manage the risk of interest rate movements, price
    changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or
    obligations incurred or to be incurred by us, or such other
    risks that are prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is
    excluded from the 95% gross income test.

For transactions entered into after July 30, 2008, any of
    our income from a “clearly identified” hedging
    transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of
    business, directly or indirectly, to manage the risk of interest
    rate movements, price changes or currency fluctuations with
    respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred
    by us is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.

For transactions entered into after July 30, 2008, any of
    our income from a “clearly identified” hedging
    transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of
    currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain
    that is included in gross income in the 95% and 75% gross income
    tests is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.

In general, a hedging transaction is “clearly
    identified” if (1) the transaction is identified as a
    hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is
    entered into and (2) the items or risks being hedged are
    identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the
    hedging transaction. An identification is not substantially
    contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after
    entering into the hedging transaction.

As to gains and items of income recognized after July 30,
    2008, “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable
    year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95%
    gross income test and “real estate foreign exchange
    gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income
    for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Real estate foreign
    exchange gain is foreign currency gain (as defined in Internal
    Revenue Code section 988(b)(1)) which is attributable to:
    (i) any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of
    the 75% gross income test; (ii) the acquisition or
    ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property
    or interests in real property; or (iii) becoming or being
    the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real
    property or on interests in real property. Real estate foreign
    exchange gain also includes Internal Revenue Code
    section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit
    (a “QBU”) of a REIT if the QBU itself meets the 75%
    income test for the taxable year and the 75% asset test at the
    close of each quarter that the REIT has directly or indirectly
    held the QBU. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes
    any other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary
    of the Treasury. Passive foreign exchange gain includes all real
    estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is
    attributable to: (i) any qualifying item of income or gain
    for purposes of the 95% gross income test; (ii) the
    acquisition or ownership of obligations; (iii) becoming or
    being the obligor under obligations; and (iv) any other
    foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the
    Treasury.



Generally, other than income from “clearly identified”
    hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of
    business, any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing,
    or engaging in substantial and regular trading, in securities
    will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the
    95% or 75% gross income tests.

Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real
    property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests
    for a REIT only if several conditions are met:

•

The amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the
    income or profits of any person, although rents generally will
    not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed
    percentage or percentages of receipts or sales.

•

Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real
    property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT,
    also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant,
    unless the tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain
    other requirements are met with respect to the real property
    being rented.

•

If rent attributable to personal property leased in connection
    with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total
    rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent
    attributable to such personal property will not qualify as
    “rents from real property.”

•

For rents to qualify as rents from real property, we generally
    must not furnish or render services to tenants, other than
    through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an “independent
    contractor” from whom we derive no income, except that we
    may directly provide services that are “usually or
    customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the
    property is located in connection with the rental of real
    property for occupancy only, or are not otherwise considered
    “rendered to the occupant for his convenience.”

•

For taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008, the REIT
    may lease qualified health care property (as defined in Internal
    Revenue Code section 856(e)(6)(D)) on an arm’s-length
    basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the property is operated
    on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who is an eligible
    independent contractor (as defined in Internal Revenue Code
    section 856(d)(9)(A)). Generally, the rent that the REIT
    receives from the taxable REIT subsidiary will be treated as
    “rents from real property.”

For taxable years beginning after August 5, 1997, a REIT
    has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of
    impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts
    received with respect to that property as rent from real
    property. The amount received or accrued by the REIT during the
    taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a
    property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by
    the REIT directly or indirectly from the property. The amount
    received for any service or management operation for this
    purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150% of the direct
    cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or
    providing the management or operation. Furthermore,
    impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable
    REIT subsidiary subject to certain conditions, and we may still
    treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from
    real property.

The term “interest” generally does not include any
    amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in
    part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount
    generally will not be excluded from the term
    “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed
    percentage of receipts or sales.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income
    tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a
    REIT for such year if we are eligible for relief. For taxable
    years beginning on or before October 22, 2004, these relief
    provisions generally will be available if: (1) our failure
    to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to
    willful neglect; (2) we attach a schedule of the sources of
    our income to our return; and (3) any incorrect information
    on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax.
    For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, these
    relief provisions generally will be available if
    (1) following our identification of the failure, we file a
    schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross
    income, and (2) the failure to meet such tests was due to
    reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.

It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under
    which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
    provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is
    imposed on an amount equal to (a) the gross income
    attributable to (1) 75% of our gross income over the amount
    of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% income test
    and (2) 95% of our gross income (90% of our gross income
    for taxable years beginning on or before



October 22, 2004) over the amount of qualifying gross
    income for purposes of the 95% income test, multiplied by
    (b) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability.

The Secretary of the Treasury is given broad authority to
    determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or
    not under the 75% and 95% gross income tests, or are to be
    excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes.

Asset Tests.

Within 30 days after the
    close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy
    several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our
    assets determined in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. At least 75% of the value of our total
    assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash
    items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of
    our operation), government securities and qualified temporary
    investments. Although the remaining 25% of our assets generally
    may be invested without restriction, we are prohibited from
    owning securities representing more than 10% of either the vote
    (the “10% vote test”) or value (the “10% value
    test”) of the outstanding securities of any issuer other
    than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT
    subsidiary. Further, no more than 25% of the total assets may be
    represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT
    subsidiaries (the “25% asset test”) and no more than
    5% of the value of our total assets may be represented by
    securities of any non-governmental issuer other than a qualified
    REIT subsidiary (the “5% asset test”), another REIT or
    a taxable REIT subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10%
    value test and the 25% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at
    the end of each quarter. There are special rules which provide
    relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to
    changes in the value of the assets of a REIT.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000,
    certain items are excluded from the 10% value test, including:
    (1) straight debt securities of an issuer (including
    straight debt that provides certain contingent payments);
    (2) any loan to an individual or an estate; (3) any
    rental agreement described in Section 467 of the Internal
    Revenue Code, other than with a “related person”;
    (4) any obligation to pay rents from real property;
    (5) certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision
    thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, or any
    political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto
    Rico; (6) any security issued by a REIT; and (7) any
    other arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary of the
    Treasury, is excepted from the definition of security
    (“excluded securities”). Special rules apply to
    straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities
    taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If a
    REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds (1) straight
    debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and
    (2) securities of such issuer that are not excluded
    securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1% of such
    issuer’s outstanding securities, the straight debt
    securities will be included in the 10% value test.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, a
    REIT’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not
    treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value
    test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt
    instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for
    purposes of applying the 10% value test (1) to the extent
    of the REIT’s interest as a partner in the partnership and
    (2) if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income
    (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would
    qualify for the 75% gross income test. For taxable years
    beginning after October 22, 2004, for purposes of the 10%
    value test, a REIT’s interest in a partnership’s
    assets is determined by the REIT’s proportionate interest
    in any securities issued by the partnership (other than the
    excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph).

For taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008, if the
    REIT or its QBU uses a foreign currency as its functional
    currency, the term “cash” includes such foreign
    currency, but only to the extent such foreign currency is
    (i) held for use in the normal course of the activities of
    the REIT or QBU which give rise to items of income or gain that
    are included in the 95% and 75% gross income tests or are
    directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under
    the 75% asset test, and (ii) not held in connection with
    dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in
    securities.

With respect to corrections of failures for which the
    requirements for corrections are satisfied after
    October 22, 2004, regardless of whether such failures
    occurred in taxable years beginning on, before or after such
    date, as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test
    or the 5% asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a
    REIT by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that
    does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT’s assets at
    the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided that
    the disposition occurs within six months following the last day
    of the quarter in which the REIT first identified the assets.
    For violations of any of the REIT asset tests due to



reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the
    thresholds described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid
    disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter
    by taking certain steps, including disposition of sufficient
    assets within the six month period described above to meet the
    applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to the greater of
    $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net
    income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period
    of time that the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and
    filing a schedule with the Internal Revenue Service that
    describes the non-qualifying assets.

Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.

For
    taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, REITs may
    own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in
    taxable REIT subsidiaries. We and any taxable corporate entity
    in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to
    treat such entity as a “taxable REIT subsidiary.”

Certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a
    taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject
    to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but
    are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that
    cannot be performed directly by REITs without jeopardizing their
    REIT status. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries will attempt to
    minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can be no
    assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to
    minimize taxes will be successful. To the extent our taxable
    REIT subsidiaries are required to pay federal, state or local
    taxes, the cash available for distribution as dividends to us
    from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced.

The amount of interest on related-party debt that a taxable REIT
    subsidiary may deduct is limited. Further, a 100% tax applies to
    any interest payments by a taxable REIT subsidiary to its
    affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate is not
    commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT subsidiary is permitted
    to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of
    these restrictions.

The Internal Revenue Service may reallocate costs between a REIT
    and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is a lack of
    arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any deductible
    expenses allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would
    increase its tax liability. Further, any amount by which a REIT
    understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable
    REIT subsidiary will, subject to certain exceptions, be subject
    to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may
    be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an
    interest.

Annual Distribution Requirements.

In order to
    avoid being taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to
    make distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to
    our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction
    in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of (i) 90%
    of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard
    to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and
    (ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from
    foreclosure property, minus (2) a portion of certain items
    of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid in the
    taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable
    year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that
    year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution
    payment after such declaration. The amount distributed must not
    be preferential. This means that every stockholder of the class
    of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the
    same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of
    stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its
    dividend rights as a class. To the extent that we do not
    distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least
    90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,”
    as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed
    amount at regular corporate tax rates. Finally, as discussed
    above, we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet
    certain other distribution requirements. We intend to make
    timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual
    distribution requirements.

It is possible that, from time to time, we may not have
    sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%
    distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount
    as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to,
    among other things, (1) timing differences between
    (i) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of
    deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and
    deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or
    (2) the payment of severance benefits that may not be
    deductible to us. In the event that timing differences occur, we
    may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or, if possible,
    pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to
    meet the distribution requirement.



Under certain circumstances, in the event of a deficiency
    determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be able to
    rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement
    for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to
    stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our
    deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year. Thus, we
    may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as
    deficiency dividends; however, we will be required to pay
    applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any
    deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions.

The Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Procedure

2008-68,

which provided temporary relief to publicly traded REITs seeking
    to preserve liquidity by electing cash/stock dividends. Under
    Revenue Procedure

2008-68,

a
    REIT may treat the entire dividend, including the stock portion,
    as a taxable dividend distribution, thereby qualifying for the
    dividends-paid deduction, provided certain requirements are
    satisfied. The cash portion of the dividend may be as low as
    10%. The Revenue Procedure, as amplified by Revenue Procedure

2010-12,

applies to dividends declared on or before December 31,
    2012, and with respect to a taxable year ending on or before
    December 31, 2011.

Failure
    to Qualify as a REIT

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable
    year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any
    applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at
    regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any
    year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be
    deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be
    required to be made in any year. All distributions to
    stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of
    current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these
    distributions and, subject to certain limitations, will be
    eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate
    stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory
    provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT
    for the four taxable years following the year during which
    qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in
    all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief.
    Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to
    incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay
    potentially significant resulting tax liabilities.

In addition to the relief described above under
    “— Income Tests” and “— Asset
    Tests,” relief is available in the event that we violate a
    provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would result in our
    failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due
    to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we
    pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to satisfy the
    provision; and (3) the violation does not include a
    violation described under “— Income Tests”
    or “— Asset Tests” above. It is not now
    possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be
    entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions.

Federal
    Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock

Treatment of Taxable
    U.S. Stockholders.

The following summary
    applies to you only if you are a
    “U.S. stockholder.” A
    “U.S. stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock
    who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is:

•

a citizen or resident of the United States;

•

a corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a
    corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
    organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any
    political subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•

an estate, the income of which is subject to United States
    federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•

a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise
    primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one
    or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal
    Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the
    trust’s substantial decisions.

So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, distributions on
    shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated
    earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not
    designated as capital gain dividends) will be includable as
    ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. None of these
    distributions will be eligible for the dividends received
    deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.



Generally, for taxable years ending after May 6, 2003
    through December 31, 2010, the maximum marginal rate of tax
    payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations
    that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15%. Except in
    limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to dividends
    paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not
    subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable
    income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The
    reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that
    portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect to
    our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received
    by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT
    subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect
    to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax
    during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute
    100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or
    (3) the amount of any earnings and profits that were
    distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year.

Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will
    be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not
    exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year),
    without regard to the period for which you held our stock.
    However, if you are a corporation, you may be required to treat
    a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income.

If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net long-term
    capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital
    gain, your proportionate share of this net long-term capital
    gain. You would also receive a refundable tax credit for your
    proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained
    capital gains, and you would have an increase in the basis of
    your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable
    capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid.

You may not include in your federal income tax return any of our
    net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules
    may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and
    preferences be apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution
    declared by us in October, November or December of any year on a
    specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid
    by us and received by you on December 31 of that year, provided
    that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than
    January 31 of the following year.

We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to
    treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required
    to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise
    tax discussed under “— General” and
    “— Qualification as a REIT — Annual
    Distribution Requirements” above. As a result, you may be
    required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions
    that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital.
    Moreover, any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as
    a dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as
    the case may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any
    other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings
    and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these
    distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your
    shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax
    basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these
    distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero, after
    which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if
    the shares of our stock are held as capital assets. The tax
    basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain
    or loss, if any, realized upon sale of the shares of our stock.
    Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which
    were held for six months or less (after application of certain
    holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term
    capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain
    distributions with respect to these shares of our stock.

Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with
    a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of
    our stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us,
    you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the
    difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange
    and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock. This
    gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock
    as a capital asset.

If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment can only be
    determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of
    redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as
    opposed to dividend income) equal to the difference between the
    amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax
    basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption:
    (1) results in a “complete termination” of your
    interest in all classes of our equity securities; (2) is a
    “substantially disproportionate redemption”; or
    (3) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend”
    with respect to you. In applying these tests, you must take into
    account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities
    (e.g., common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and
    warrants). You also must take into account any equity securities
    that are considered to be constructively owned by you.



If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you no
    longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity
    securities or only own (actually and constructively) an
    insubstantial percentage of our equity securities, then it is
    probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered
    “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and, thus,
    would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a
    distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a
    dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances,
    and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption,
    you should consult your tax advisor to determine their
    application to the particular situation.

Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests described
    above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of
    your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a
    dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or
    accumulated earnings and profits. If the redemption is taxed as
    a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will
    be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If
    you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain
    circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related
    person, or it may be lost entirely.

Gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than
    one year is taxed at a maximum long-term capital gain rate,
    which is currently 15%. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service
    guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends
    as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as
    gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt
    U.S. Stockholders.

Tax-exempt entities,
    including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts
    and individual retirement accounts (“Exempt
    Organizations”), generally are exempt from federal income
    taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their
    unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The
    Internal Revenue Service has issued a published revenue ruling
    that dividend distributions from a REIT to an exempt employee
    pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares
    of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or
    business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on this
    ruling, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations
    generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt
    Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock
    with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI
    pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules.
    Likewise, a portion of the Exempt Organization’s income
    from us would constitute UBTI if we held a residual interest in
    a real estate mortgage investment conduit.

In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns
    more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a percentage of
    our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension trust
    holding more than 10% of our stock only if: (1) the
    percentage of our income that is UBTI (determined as if we were
    a pension trust) is at least 5%; (2) we qualify as a REIT
    by reason of the modification of the Five or Fewer Requirement
    that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as
    holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the
    pension trust; and (3) either (i) one pension trust
    owns more than 25% of the value of our stock, or (ii) a
    group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of
    the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the
    value of our stock.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

Under certain circumstances, you may
    be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments
    made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of,
    shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply only if you:
    (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
    number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your
    social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer
    identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
    Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments
    of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under
    penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer
    identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has
    not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made
    to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and
    tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor
    regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding,
    and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding
    is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup
    withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be
    allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s United
    States federal income tax liability and may entitle such
    stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information
    is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition,
    withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to
    stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to
    certify their non-foreign status.



Taxation of Foreign Stockholders.

The
    following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign
    person. The federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly
    complex matter that may be affected by many considerations.

Except as discussed below, distributions to you of cash
    generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary
    dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital
    assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax
    at a rate of 30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that
    tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower
    rate.

In general, you will be subject to United States federal income
    tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with
    respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is
    “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade
    or business in the United States. A corporate foreign
    stockholder that receives income that is, or is treated as,
    effectively connected with a United States trade or business may
    also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in
    addition to regular United States corporate income tax. The
    following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose
    investment in us is not so effectively connected. We expect to
    withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the
    gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless
    (1) you file an Internal Revenue Service

Form W-8ECI

with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively
    connected” or (2) certain other exceptions apply.

Distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale
    or exchange of a United States real property interest will be
    taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax
    Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were
    gains “effectively connected” with a United States
    trade or business. Accordingly, you will be taxed at the normal
    capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on
    these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax
    and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident
    alien individuals. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be
    subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate
    foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption.

We will be required to withhold from distributions subject to
    FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of
    designated capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the
    amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital
    gain dividends. In addition, if we designate prior distributions
    as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions, up to the
    amount of the prior distributions not withheld against, will be
    treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.

For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, any
    capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is
    “regularly traded” on an established securities market
    will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign
    stockholder did not own more than 5% of such class of stock at
    any time during the taxable year. Once this provision takes
    effect, foreign stockholders generally will not be required to
    report distributions received from us on U.S. federal
    income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends
    for U.S. federal income tax purposes including any capital
    gain dividend will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax
    (unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as
    discussed above. In addition, the branch profits tax will no
    longer apply to such distributions.

Unless our shares constitute a “United States real property
    interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively
    connected with a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our
    shares by you generally will not be subject to United States
    taxation. Our shares will not constitute a United States real
    property interest if we qualify as a “domestically
    controlled REIT.” We believe that we, and expect to
    continue to, qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. A
    domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times
    during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its
    shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders.
    However, if you are a nonresident alien individual who is
    present in the United States for 183 days or more during
    the taxable year and certain other conditions apply, you will be
    subject to a 30% tax on such capital gains. In any event, a
    purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under
    FIRPTA to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares
    are “regularly traded” on an established securities
    market or if we are a domestically controlled REIT. Otherwise,
    under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be required to withhold 10% of
    the purchase price and remit such amount to the Internal Revenue
    Service.

Backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally
    not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States
    that are treated as: (1) dividends to which the 30% or
    lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed



above applies; (2) capital gains dividends; or
    (3) distributions attributable to gain from the sale or
    exchange by us of U.S. real property interests. Payment of
    the proceeds of a sale of stock within the United States or
    conducted through certain U.S. related financial
    intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and
    information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies
    under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a
    U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge
    that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or otherwise
    established an exemption. You may obtain a refund of any amounts
    withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the
    appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service.

U.S.
    Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Depositary
    Shares

Owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were
    owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the
    depositary shares. Thus, you will be required to take into
    account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled
    if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock.

Conversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred
    Stock.

No gain or loss will be recognized upon
    the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary
    shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will,
    upon exchange, be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the
    depositary shares exchanged. If you held your depositary shares
    as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of
    preferred stock, the holding period for your shares of preferred
    stock will include the period during which you owned the
    depositary shares.

U.S.
    Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Debt
    Securities

The following is a general summary of the United States federal
    income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder
    that is a

non-U.S. holder,

as defined below, the United States federal estate tax
    consequences, of purchasing, owning and disposing of debt
    securities periodically offered under one or more indentures
    (the “notes”). This summary assumes that you hold the
    notes as capital assets. This summary applies to you only if you
    are the initial holder of the notes and you acquire the notes
    for a price equal to the issue price of the notes. The issue
    price of the notes is the first price at which a substantial
    amount of the notes is sold other than to bond houses, brokers
    or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
    underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. In addition, this
    summary does not consider any foreign, state, local or other tax
    laws that may be applicable to us or a purchaser of the notes.

U.S.
    Holders

The following summary applies to you only if you are a
    U.S. holder, as defined below.

Definition of a U.S. Holder.

A
    “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a note or
    notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes:

•

a citizen or resident of the United States;

•

a corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a
    corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
    organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any
    political subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•

an estate, the income of which is subject to United States
    federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•

a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise
    primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one
    or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal
    Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the
    trust’s substantial decisions.

Payments of Interest.

Stated interest on the
    notes generally will be taxed as ordinary interest income from
    domestic sources at the time it is paid or accrues in accordance
    with your method of accounting for tax purposes.



Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of
    Notes.

The adjusted tax basis in your note
    acquired at a premium will generally be your cost. You generally
    will recognize taxable gain or loss when you sell or otherwise
    dispose of your notes equal to the difference, if any, between:

•

the amount realized on the sale or other disposition, less any
    amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will be
    taxable in the manner described under “— Payments
    of Interest” above; and

•

your adjusted tax basis in the notes.

Your gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. This
    capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if
    at the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the
    notes for more than one year. Subject to limited exceptions,
    your capital losses cannot be used to offset your ordinary
    income.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

In general, “backup
    withholding” may apply to any payments made to you of
    principal and interest on your note, and to payment of the
    proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your note before
    maturity, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder and:
    (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
    number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your
    social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer
    identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
    Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments
    of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under
    penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer
    identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has
    not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.

The amount of any reportable payments, including interest, made
    to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of
    tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be
    reported to you and to the Internal Revenue Service for each
    calendar year. You should consult your tax advisor regarding
    your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and
    the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable.
    The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be
    credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability,
    provided that correct information is provided to the Internal
    Revenue Service.

Non-U.S.

Holders

The following summary applies to you if you are a beneficial
    owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above
    (a

“non-U.S. holder”).

Special rules may apply to certain

non-U.S. holders

such as “controlled foreign corporations,”
    “passive foreign investment companies” and
    “foreign personal holding companies.” Such entities
    are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the
    United States federal, state, local and other tax consequences
    that may be relevant to them.

U.S. Federal Withholding Tax.

Subject to
    the discussion below, U.S. federal withholding tax will not
    apply to payments by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as
    such, of principal and interest on your notes under the
    “portfolio interest” exception of the Internal Revenue
    Code, provided that:

•

you do not, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively,
    own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
    classes of our stock entitled to vote;

•

you are not (1) a controlled foreign corporation for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related, directly
    or indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership, as
    provided in the Internal Revenue Code, or (2) a bank
    receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
    Internal Revenue Code;

•

such interest is not effectively connected with your conduct of
    a U.S. trade or business; and

•

you provide a signed written statement, under penalties of
    perjury, which can reliably be related to you, certifying that
    you are not a U.S. person within the meaning of the
    Internal Revenue Code and providing your name and address to:

•

us or our paying agent; or

•

a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial
    institution that holds customers’ securities in the
    ordinary course of its trade or business and holds your notes on
    your behalf and that certifies to us or our paying agent under
    penalties of perjury that it, or the bank or financial
    institution between it and you, has



received from you your signed, written statement and provides us
    or our paying agent with a copy of such statement.

Treasury regulations provide that:

•

if you are a foreign partnership, the certification requirement
    will generally apply to your partners, and you will be required
    to provide certain information;

•

if you are a foreign trust, the certification requirement will
    generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners depending
    on whether you are a “foreign complex trust,”
    “foreign simple trust,” or “foreign grantor
    trust” as defined in the Treasury regulations; and

•

look-through rules will apply for tiered partnerships, foreign
    simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts.

If you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, you should
    consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these
    Treasury regulations and the certification requirements
    applicable to you.

If you cannot satisfy the portfolio interest requirements
    described above, payments of interest will be subject to the 30%
    United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a
    properly executed (1) Internal Revenue Service

Form W-8BEN

claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the
    benefit of an applicable treaty or (2) Internal Revenue
    Service

Form W-8ECI

stating that interest paid on the note is not subject to
    withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your
    conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Alternative
    documentation may be applicable in certain circumstances.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States
    and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct
    of that trade or business, you will be required to pay United
    States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis
    (although you will be exempt from the 30% withholding tax
    provided the certification requirement described above is met)
    in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as
    otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a
    foreign corporation, you may be required to pay a branch profits
    tax on the earnings and profits that are effectively connected
    to the conduct of your trade or business in the United States.

Sale, Exchange or other Disposition of
    Notes.

You generally will not have to pay
    U.S. federal income tax on any gain or income realized from
    the sale, redemption, retirement at maturity or other
    disposition of your notes, unless:

•

in the case of gain, you are an individual who is present in the
    United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year
    of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific
    other conditions are met;

•

you are subject to tax provisions applicable to certain United
    States expatriates; or

•

the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a
    U.S. trade or business.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States,
    and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected
    with the conduct of that trade or business, you generally will
    be subject to U.S. income tax on a net basis on the gain.
    In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be
    subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected
    earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for
    certain items.

U.S. Federal Estate Tax.

If you are an
    individual and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the
    United States, as specially defined for U.S. federal estate
    tax purposes, at the time of your death, your notes will
    generally not be subject to the U.S. federal estate tax,
    unless, at the time of your death (1) you owned actually or
    constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of
    all our classes of stock entitled to vote, or (2) interest
    on the notes is effectively connected with your conduct of a
    U.S. trade or business.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

Backup withholding will not apply to
    payments of principal or interest made by us or our paying
    agent, in its capacity as such, to you if you have provided the
    required certification that you are a

non-U.S. holder

as described in “— U.S. Federal Withholding
    Tax” above, and provided that neither we nor our paying
    agent have actual knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as
    described in “— U.S. Holders” above. We
    or our paying agent may, however, report payments of interest on
    the notes.



The gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes may be
    subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If
    you sell your notes outside the United States through a

non-U.S. office

of a

non-U.S. broker

and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United
    States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information
    reporting requirements generally will not apply to that payment.
    However, U.S. information reporting, but not backup
    withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if
    that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell your
    notes through a

non-U.S. office

of a broker that:

•

is a U.S. person, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code;

•

derives 50% or more of its gross income in specific periods from
    the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;

•

is a “controlled foreign corporation” for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes; or

•

is a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year,
    one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who in the
    aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests
    in the partnership, or the foreign partnership is engaged in a
    U.S. trade or business, unless the broker has documentary
    evidence in its files that you are a

non-U.S. person

and certain other conditions are met or you otherwise establish
    an exemption. If you receive payments of the proceeds of a sale
    of your notes to or through a U.S. office of a broker, the
    payment is subject to both U.S. backup withholding and
    information reporting unless you provide a

Form W-8BEN

certifying that you are a

non-U.S. person

or you otherwise establish an exemption.

You should consult your own tax advisor regarding application of
    backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the
    availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from
    backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup
    withholding rules from a payment to you will be allowed as a
    refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax
    liability, provided the required information is furnished to the
    Internal Revenue Service.

U.S.
    Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our
    Warrants

Exercise of Warrants.

You will not generally
    recognize gain or loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your
    basis in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares
    or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise
    of the warrant will be equal to the sum of your adjusted tax
    basis in the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding
    period in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary
    shares or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the
    exercise of the warrant will not include the period during which
    the warrant was held by you.

Expiration of Warrants.

Upon the expiration of
    a warrant, you will recognize a capital loss in an amount equal
    to your adjusted tax basis in the warrant.

Sale or Exchange of Warrants.

Upon the sale or
    exchange of a warrant to a person other than us, you will
    recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
    between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your
    adjusted tax basis in the warrant. Such gain or loss will be
    capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss
    if the warrant was held for more than one year. Upon the sale of
    the warrant to us, the Internal Revenue Service may argue that
    you should recognize ordinary income on the sale. You are
    advised to consult your own tax advisors as to the consequences
    of a sale of a warrant to us.

Potential
    Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax
    Consequences

Current and prospective securities holders should recognize that
    the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us
    may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative
    action at any time and that any such action may affect
    investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing
    with federal income taxation are constantly under review by
    persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal
    Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in
    revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of
    established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in
    federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could
    adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.

Risk
    Factors

Forward-Looking
    Statements and Risk Factors

This section discusses the most significant factors that affect
    our business, operations and financial condition. It does not
    describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our
    industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following
    risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet
    identified or that we currently think are not material, actually
    occur, we could be materially adversely affected. In that event,
    the value of our securities could decline.

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements
    that constitute “forward-looking statements” as that
    term is defined in the federal securities laws. These
    forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
    those regarding:

•

the possible expansion of our portfolio;

•

the sale of properties;

•

the performance of our operators/tenants and properties;

•

our ability to enter into agreements with new viable tenants for
    vacant space or for properties that we take back from
    financially troubled tenants, if any;

•

our occupancy rates;

•

our ability to acquire, develop

and/or

manage properties;

•

our ability to make distributions to stockholders;

•

our policies and plans regarding investments, financings and
    other matters;

•

our tax status as a real estate investment trust;

•

our critical accounting policies;

•

our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity;

•

our ability to access capital markets or other sources of
    funds; and

•

our ability to meet our earnings guidance.

When we use words such as “may,” “will,”
    “intend,” “should,” “believe,”
    “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,”
    “estimate” or similar expressions, we are making
    forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
    uncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and
    actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This
    may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited
    to:

•

the status of the economy;

•

the status of capital markets, including availability and cost
    of capital;

•

issues facing the health care industry, including compliance
    with, and changes to, regulations and payment policies,
    responding to government investigations and punitive settlements
    and operators’/tenants’ difficulty in cost-effectively
    obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;

•

changes in financing terms;



•

competition within the health care and senior housing industries;

•

negative developments in the operating results or financial
    condition of operators/tenants, including, but not limited to,
    their ability to pay rent and repay loans;

•

our ability to transition or sell facilities with profitable
    results;

•

the failure to make new investments as and when anticipated;

•

acts of God affecting our properties;

•

our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies
    occur;

•

our ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to
    assets sold;

•

operator/tenant bankruptcies or insolvencies;

•

government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid
    reimbursement rates and operational requirements;

•

liability or contract claims by or against operators/tenants;

•

unanticipated difficulties

and/or

expenditures relating to future acquisitions;

•

environmental laws affecting our properties;

•

changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting;

•

other legal and operational matters, including REIT
    qualification and key management personnel recruitment and
    retention; and

•

the risks described below:

Risk
    factors related to our operators’ revenues and
    expenses

Our investment property operators’ revenues are primarily
    driven by occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if
    applicable, and private pay rates. Expenses for these facilities
    are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities,
    taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from
    government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under
    pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.
    Liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for
    our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues

and/or

any
    increase in operating expenses result in a property not
    generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our
    operator and the value of other collateral would have to be
    relied upon.

The ongoing credit and liquidity crisis, and the weakening
    economy, may have an adverse effect on our operators and
    tenants, including their ability to access credit or maintain
    occupancy rates. If the operations, cash flows or financial
    condition of our operators are materially adversely impacted by
    the current economic conditions, our revenue and operations may
    be adversely affected.

Increased
    competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their
    obligations to us

The operators of our properties compete on a local and regional
    basis with operators of properties and other health care
    providers that provide comparable services. We cannot be certain
    that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to
    achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable
    them to meet all of their obligations to us. Our operators are
    expected to encounter increased competition in the future that
    could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their
    businesses.

Risk
    factors related to obligor bankruptcies

We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to
    meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,
    which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that
    an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency
    proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease
    agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand
    immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our
    loans



provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation,
    demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest,
    foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the
    bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party
    that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An obligor in
    bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to
    limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of
    a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case
    of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies.

We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate
    taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment
    property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property

and/or

transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we
    have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property
    to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided
    working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new
    obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new
    tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may
    expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events
    occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely
    affected.

Transfers
    of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and
    these facilities may not have efficient alternative
    uses

Transfers of health care facilities to successor operators
    frequently are subject to regulatory approvals, including change
    of ownership approvals under certificate of need
    (“CON”) laws, state licensure laws and Medicare and
    Medicaid provider arrangements, that are not required for
    transfers of other types of real estate. The replacement of an
    operator could be delayed by the approval process of any
    federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the
    facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage
    the facility. Alternatively, given the specialized nature of our
    facilities, we may be required to spend substantial time and
    funds to adapt these properties to other uses. If we are unable
    to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find
    efficient alternative uses, our revenue and operations may be
    adversely affected.

Risk
    factors related to government regulations

Our obligors’ businesses are affected by government
    reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that an
    operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues
    from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such
    revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,
    retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments
    or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,
    payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers,
    government funding restrictions (at a program level or with
    respect to specific facilities) and interruption or delays in
    payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and
    audits at such property. In recent years, governmental payors
    have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to
    budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely
    continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state
    authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate
    timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the
    financial condition of our obligors and properties. There can be
    no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be
    available for services provided by any property operator,
    whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare,
    Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of
    services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could
    have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations, which could
    adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its
    obligations to us. See “Item 1 —
    Business — Certain Government Regulations —
    Reimbursement” above.

Our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive
    federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection
    laws and regulations. Our operators’ or tenants’
    failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of
    accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines,
    suspension or decertification from federal and state health care
    programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such
    actions may have an effect on our operators’ or
    tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and,
    therefore, adversely impact us. See
    “Item 1 — Business — Certain
    Government Regulations — Other Related Laws”
    above.

Many of our properties may require a license

and/or

CON
    to operate. Failure to obtain a license or CON, or loss of a
    required license or CON would prevent a facility from operating
    in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events
    could materially adversely affect our operators’ or
    tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us. State and
    local laws also may regulate expansion, including the addition
    of new beds or services or acquisition of



medical equipment, and the construction of health care
    facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval. See
    “Item 1 — Business — Certain
    Government Regulations — Licensing and
    Certification” above.

The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, which was
    signed into law on February 17, 2009, provides
    $87 billion in additional federal Medicaid funding for
    states’ Medicaid expenditures between October 1, 2008
    and December 31, 2010. Under this Act, states meeting
    certain eligibility requirements will temporarily receive
    additional money in the form of an increase in the federal
    medical assistance percentage (FMAP). Thus, for a limited period
    of time, the share of Medicaid costs that are paid for by the
    federal government will go up, and each state’s share will
    go down. We cannot predict whether states are, or will remain,
    eligible to receive the additional federal Medicaid funding, or
    whether the states will have sufficient funds for their Medicaid
    programs. We also cannot predict the impact that this
    broad-based, far-reaching legislation will have on the
    U.S. economy or our business.

Risk
    factors related to liability claims and insurance
    costs

In recent years, skilled nursing and seniors housing operators
    have experienced substantial increases in both the number and
    size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and
    professional liability costs have increased in some markets.
    However, a recent report and state survey found that the
    liability insurance market is beginning to stabilize in most
    markets. In 2008, national average liability loss costs were
    stable for the first time in nearly a decade. State-led tort
    reform efforts have greatly contributed to decreasing costs. In
    some markets general and professional liability insurance
    coverage continues to be restricted or very costly, which may
    adversely affect the property operators’ future operations,
    cash flows and financial condition, and may have a material
    adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet
    their obligations to us.

Risk
    factors related to acquisitions

We are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not
    prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated
    difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired
    properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired
    properties might require significant management attention that
    would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree
    to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the
    project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure
    completion of the project. Moreover, if we issue equity
    securities or incur additional debt, or both, to finance future
    acquisitions, it may reduce our per share financial results.
    These costs may negatively affect our results of operations.

Risk
    factors related to joint ventures

We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter
    into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or
    entities. Joint venture investments involve risks, including the
    possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise
    refuse to make capital contributions when due; that our partner
    might at any time have investment goals which are inconsistent
    with ours; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our
    partner, which could require us to expend additional resources
    to resolve such disputes; and that our partner may be in a
    position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our
    instructions or requests. In addition, our ability to transfer
    our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be
    restricted. In some instances, we and our partner may each have
    the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause
    us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner’s interest,
    at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a
    transaction. Joint ventures require us to share decision-making
    authority with our partners, which limits our ability to control
    the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a
    controlling interest, certain major decisions may require
    partner approval.

Risk
    factors related to life sciences facilities

Our tenants in the life sciences industry face high levels of
    regulation, expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect
    their ability to make payments to us. Research, development and
    clinical testing of products and technologies can be very
    expensive and sources of funds may not be available to our life
    sciences tenants in the future. The products and technologies
    that are developed and manufactured by our life sciences tenants
    may require regulatory approval prior to being made, marketed,
    sold and used. The regulatory process can be costly, long and



unpredictable. Even after a tenant gains regulatory approval and
    market acceptance, the product still presents regulatory and
    liability risks, such as safety concerns, competition from new
    products and eventually the expiration of patent protection.
    These factors may affect the ability of our life sciences
    tenants to make timely payments to us, which may adversely
    affect our revenue and operations.

Risk
    factors related to indebtedness

Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided
    through a combination of public and private offerings of debt
    and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of
    secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may
    cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require
    us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment
    of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn
    in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional
    financing, or (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or
    outlook by one or more of the noted rating agencies.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require
    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth
    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
    create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of
    these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments
    governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other
    indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These
    defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Risk
    factors related to our credit ratings

As of February 12, 2010, our senior unsecured notes were
    rated Baa2 (stable), BBB- (positive) and BBB (stable) by
    Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s
    Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, respectively. We plan to
    manage the Company to maintain investment grade status with a
    capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there
    can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current
    credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by
    any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material
    adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which
    could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    results of operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition.

Risk
    factors related to interest rate swaps

We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to
    manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility. These
    swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that
    counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these
    arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be
    effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.
    When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a
    risk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against
    which the swap is intended to hedge. If such events occur, our
    results of operations may be adversely affected.

Risk
    factors related to environmental laws

Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of
    real estate may be required to respond to the presence or
    release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held
    liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that
    result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous
    substances. We may become liable to reimburse the government for
    damages and costs it incurs in connection with the
    contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person
    based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our
    tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition
    of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site
    assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to
    taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to
    meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we
    believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if
    environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we
    do not believe that any of our properties are subject to
    material environmental contamination. However, environmental
    liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur
    costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the
    business or financial condition of our obligors.



Risk
    factors related to facilities that require entrance
    fees

Certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of
    an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may
    be refundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are
    subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to
    these funds. As a result of this oversight, residents of these
    facilities may have a variety of rights, including, for example,
    the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of
    time and certain lien rights. The oversight and rights of
    residents within these facilities may have an effect on the
    revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and
    therefore may negatively impact us.

Risk
    factors related to facilities under construction or
    development

At any given time, we may be in the process of constructing one
    or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON and
    license before they can be utilized by the operator for their
    intended use. The operator also may need to obtain Medicare and
    Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid
    provider agreements

and/or

third
    party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable
    to obtain the necessary CON, licensure, certification, provider
    agreements or contracts after the completion of construction,
    there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on
    the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license
    or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary
    provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract
    with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate
    the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider
    agreements or contracts.

In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development
    and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain,
    or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use,
    building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and
    authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or
    our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be
    able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us
    unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may
    not be able to complete construction and

lease-up

of
    a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt
    service expense or construction costs.

Additionally, the time frame required for development,
    construction and

lease-up

of
    these properties means that we may have to wait years for
    significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash
    distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from
    operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to
    borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly
    developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow
    that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall
    financial performance.

In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property,
    we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of
    that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our
    investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates. If our
    financial projections with respect to a new property are
    inaccurate, and the property is unable to achieve the expected
    occupancy and rental rates, it may fail to perform as we
    expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs
    of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove
    to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our
    profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties
    that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing
    operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and
    debt service associated with that property.

We do
    not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases, and if
    they do not, we may be unable to lease the properties on as
    favorable terms, or at all

We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases
    at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times
    through 2079. If these leases are not renewed, we would be
    required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or
    sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to
    identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with
    new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or
    that we would be able to lease those properties at all.

Our
    ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the
    loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground
    leases

We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by
    acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the
    building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in
    the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases.
    As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the
    possibility of losing the property upon termination of the
    ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.



Illiquidity
    of real estate investments could significantly impede our
    ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our
    properties

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to
    quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to
    changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No
    assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for
    any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons.
    Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance
    of our investments could adversely affect our financial
    condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed
    to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real
    estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care
    industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could
    adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to
    sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us.

Risk
    factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds

From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the
    proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments
    on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,
    including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master
    leases or similar financial support arrangements. In order to
    maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive
    returns, we expect to re-invest these proceeds in a timely
    manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad
    variety of potential investors. This competition for attractive
    investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely
    investments on terms acceptable to us.

Failure
    to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our
    management or increase our expenses

We have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively
    short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in
    the future. This growth has resulted in increased levels of
    responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions
    could place significant additional demands on, and require us to
    expand, our management, resources and personnel. Our failure to
    manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business
    and, in particular, our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows, which could negatively affect our
    ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our growth could
    also increase our capital requirements, which may require us to
    issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur
    additional debt.

We
    might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a
    REIT

We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code
    and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a
    manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious
    tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds
    available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to
    our stockholders for each of the years involved because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to
    stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be
    subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and
    possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we
    could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable
    years following the year during which we were disqualified.

Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex
    requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them,
    and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of
    federal taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the
    amount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not
    qualify as a REIT, we would not be required to make
    distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT is not required,
    in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an excise tax, to pay
    dividends to stockholders. See “Item 1 —
    Business — Federal Income Tax Considerations” for
    a discussion of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that
    apply to us and the effects of non-qualification.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions
    to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the
    extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits,
    although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the
    dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be
    eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to
    long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%)
    with respect to distributions.

As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a
    REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business
    strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common
    stock.



Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly
    technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which
    there are only limited judicial and administrative
    interpretations. The determination of various factual matters
    and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our
    ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that
    we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue
    to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes. See
    “Item 1 — Business —
    Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations”
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The
    90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity
    and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial
    transactions

To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to
    REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make
    distributions to our stockholders. See
    “Item 1 — Business
    — Taxation — Federal Income Tax
    Considerations — Qualification as a REIT —
    Annual Distribution Requirements” included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient
    cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT
    distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to
    time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to
    meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we may decide to
    retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be
    necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due
    to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and
    actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the
    inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in
    arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition,
    non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or
    repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash
    deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or
    liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution
    requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we
    deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue
    additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that
    we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if
    possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a
    transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution
    requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to
    meet our obligations.

The amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by
    the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indentures
    governing our senior unsecured notes. In addition, adverse
    economic conditions may impact the availability of additional
    funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow
    additional funds to become unfavorable. In those circumstances,
    we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital
    markets. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors
    over which we have little or no control, including rising
    interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions
    and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our
    current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and
    the market price of the shares of our capital stock. We cannot
    assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary
    to make future investments or to meet our obligations and
    commitments as they mature.

Other
    risk factors

We are also subject to other risks. First, our Second Restated
    Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated
    By-Laws contain anti-takeover provisions (staggered board
    provisions, restrictions on share ownership and transfer and
    super majority stockholder approval requirements for business
    combinations) that could make it more difficult for or even
    prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of
    our incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that
    inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market
    value of our common stock.

Additionally, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we
    have entered into employment agreements with our executive
    officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily,
    have an adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing
    more than one could have a material adverse impact on our
    business.

and holdover leases and excluding terminations and discontinued
    operations) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Occupancy for
    investment properties represents average quarterly operating
    occupancy based on the quarters ended September 30, 2009
    and 2008 and excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed
    or for which data is not available or meaningful. The Company
    uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely
    by tenants/borrowers to calculate occupancy for investment
    properties and has not independently verified the information.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the
    consolidated financial statements of Health Care REIT, Inc. for
    the periods presented and should be read together with the notes
    thereto contained in this Annual Report on

Other important factors are identified in
    “Item 1 — Business” and
    “Item 1A — Risk Factors” above.

Executive
    Overview

Company
    Overview

Health Care REIT, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a real
    estate investment trust that invests in senior housing and
    health care real estate. Founded in 1970, we were the first REIT
    to invest exclusively in health care properties. The following
    table summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2009:

Investment per metric was computed
    by using the total investment amount of $6,299,748,000 which
    includes real estate investments and unfunded construction
    commitments for which initial funding has commenced which
    amounted to $6,085,803,000 and $213,945,000, respectively.

Health
    Care Industry

The demand for health care services, and consequently health
    care properties, is projected to reach unprecedented levels in
    the near future. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
    projects that national health expenditures will rise to $3.4
    trillion in 2015 or 17.7% of gross domestic product
    (“GDP”). This is up from $2 trillion or 15.9% of GDP
    in 2005. Health expenditures per capita are projected to rise
    approximately 4.7% per year from 2005 to 2015. While
    demographics are the primary driver of demand, economic
    conditions and availability of services contribute to health
    care service utilization rates. We believe the health care
    property market is less susceptible to fluctuations and economic
    downturns relative to other property sectors. Investor interest
    in the market remains strong, especially in specific sectors
    such as medical office buildings, regardless of the current
    stringent lending environment. As a REIT, we believe we are
    situated to benefit from any turbulence in the capital markets
    due to our access to capital.

The total U.S. population is projected to increase by 16.4%
    through 2030. The elderly are an important component of health
    care utilization, especially independent living services,
    assisted living services, skilled nursing services, inpatient
    and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care.
    The elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase
    by 76.6% through 2030. Most health care services are provided
    within a health care facility such as a hospital, a
    physician’s office or a senior housing facility. Therefore,
    we believe there will be continued demand for companies such as
    ours with expertise in health care real estate.



The following chart illustrates the projected increase in the
    elderly population aged 65 and over:

Source: U.S. Census Bureau

Health care real estate investment opportunities tend to
    increase as demand for health care services increases. We
    recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates
    to health care service demand. Health care providers require
    real estate to house their businesses and expand their services.
    We believe that investment opportunities in health care real
    estate will continue to be present due to the:

•

Specialized nature of the industry which enhances the
    credibility and experience of our company;

•

Projected population growth combined with stable or increasing
    health care utilization rates which ensures demand; and

•

On-going merger and acquisition activity.

Recent Developments.

Both the Senate and House
    of Representatives have passed legislation to reform the
    U.S. health care system. By the time this report is
    released, final reform legislation may already have been passed.
    The legislation involves the expansion of insurance coverage
    primarily through reform of the private insurance market, as
    well as changes to existing government programs. The reform
    efforts are intended to lead to more efficient, effective care,
    reduce waste, and benefit the most efficient, quality-conscious
    providers. As a company, we are well-situated to respond to any
    changes in health care delivery and organization resulting from
    this legislation. Future reform, broadened insurance coverage,
    changes in Medicare and Medicaid, changes in provider
    reimbursement, and changes in health care sector funding could
    have a significant impact on our operators’ financial
    situation and strategy, which we will continue to monitor.

Economic
    Outlook

Beginning in late 2007, the U.S. and global economy entered
    a serious recession. The current economic environment is
    characterized by a severe residential housing slump, depressed
    commercial real estate valuations, weakened consumer confidence,
    rising unemployment and concerns regarding inflation, deflation
    and stagflation. Numerous financial systems around the globe
    have become illiquid and banks have become less willing to lend
    to other banks and borrowers. Further, capital markets have
    become and remain volatile as risk is repriced and investments
    are revalued. Uncertainty remains in terms of the depth and
    duration of these adverse economic conditions.

The conditions described above have created an environment of
    limited capital availability and increasing capital costs. This
    was most evident in the credit markets, where lending
    institutions cut back on loans, tightened credit standards and
    significantly increased interest rate spreads. The equity
    markets were characterized by sporadic accessibility until late
    2008, when share prices in most sectors declined significantly.
    Continued volatility in the capital markets could limit our
    ability to access debt or equity funds which, in turn, could
    impact our ability to finance future investments and react to
    changing economic and business conditions. This difficult
    operating environment also may make it more difficult for some
    of our operators/tenants to meet their obligations to us.



During 2008, our focus gradually shifted from investment to
    capital preservation. To that end, our efforts in 2009 were
    directed towards: liquidity, portfolio management and investment
    strategy.

•

Liquidity.

Liquidity has become increasingly
    important and we have concentrated our efforts on further
    strengthening our balance sheet. We raised over $1 billion
    in funds during each of 2008 and 2009 from a combination of
    common stock offerings, our dividend reinvestment plan, our
    equity shelf program, property sales and loan payoffs. As
    always, we will continue to closely monitor the credit and
    capital markets for opportunities to raise reasonably priced
    capital.

•

Portfolio Management.

Our investment approach
    has produced a portfolio that is very diverse with strong
    property level payment coverages. Yet, today’s adverse
    economic conditions can negatively impact even the strongest
    portfolio. Our portfolio management program is designed to
    maintain our portfolio’s strength through a combination of
    extensive industry research, stringent origination and
    underwriting protocols and a rigorous asset management process.

•

Investment Strategy.

For the short-term, we
    expect to fund our ongoing development projects and will
    evaluate new investments selectively and only when funding
    sources are clearly identified. However, we will continue to
    strengthen our existing customer relationships and begin to
    cultivate new relationships. We remain focused on preserving
    liquidity, but we intend to take advantage of what we believe
    will be increasingly attractive investment opportunities over
    time.

Business
    Strategy

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and
    enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash
    dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase
    dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual
    increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To
    meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of
    senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our
    investment portfolio by property type, operator/tenant and
    geographic location.

Substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from
    operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest
    earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent
    our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are
    dependent upon our obligors’ continued ability to make
    contractual rent and interest payments to us. To the extent that
    our obligors experience operating difficulties and are unable to
    generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be
    a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our
    investments through a variety of methods determined by the type
    of property and operator/tenant. Our asset management process
    includes review of monthly financial statements for each
    property, periodic review of obligor credit, periodic property
    inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to
    licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other
    collateral. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a
    proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific
    data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain
    industry trends and risks. Through these asset management and
    research efforts, we are typically able to intervene at an early
    stage to address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the
    collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.

In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we
    also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk.
    Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by
    guaranties

and/or

letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically
    structured as master leases and loans are generally
    cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans,
    operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and
    its affiliates.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, rental income and
    interest income represented 90% and 7%, respectively, of total
    gross revenues (including discontinued operations).
    Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with
    either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures. Leases
    with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on
    a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to
    a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases
    with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our
    yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors,
    including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount
    outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate
    adjustments.



Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we
    believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations, meet
    debt service obligations (both principal and interest), make
    dividend distributions and complete construction projects in
    process. We also anticipate evaluating opportunities to finance
    future investments. New investments are generally funded from
    temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from
    sales of real property. Our investments generate internal cash
    from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans
    receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which
    replaces funds drawn under the unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, has historically been provided through a
    combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity
    securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new
    investments will be available in the future with spreads over
    our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to
    our stockholders. We expect to complete gross new investments of
    $1.0 to $1.2 billion in 2010, comprised of new investments
    totaling $700,000,000 to $800,000,000 and funded new development
    of $300,000,000 to $400,000,000. We anticipate the sale of real
    property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling
    approximately $300,000,000 during 2010. It is possible that
    additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur
    in the future. To the extent that loan repayments and real
    property sales exceed new investments, our revenues and cash
    flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to
    reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property
    sales in new investments. To the extent that new investment
    requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to
    borrow under our unsecured line of credit arrangement. At
    December 31, 2009, we had $35,476,000 of cash and cash
    equivalents, $23,237,000 of restricted cash and $1,010,000,000
    of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of
    credit arrangement. Our investment activity may exceed our
    borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit. To the
    extent that we are unable to issue equity or debt securities to
    provide additional capital, we may not be able to fund all of
    our potential investments, which could have an adverse effect on
    our revenues and cash flows from operations.

Key
    Transactions in 2009

We completed the following key transactions during the year
    ended December 31, 2009:

•

we completed $716,649,000 of gross investments offset by
    $280,569,000 of investment payoffs;

•

we were added to the S&P 500 Index in January 2009;

•

we completed a public offering of 5,816,870 shares of
    common stock with net proceeds of approximately $210,880,000 in
    February 2009;

•

we completed $265,527,000 of first mortgage loans secured by 31
    senior housing properties with multiple levels of service. The
    debt has terms ranging from seven to ten years. The debt had
    weighted average initial interest rates of 5.98% after giving
    effect to certain interest rate swap agreements. KeyBank Capital
    Markets, Inc. originated the loans and sold them to Freddie Mac;

•

we extinguished $81,715,000 of secured debt with weighted
    average interest rates of 7.21% prior to maturity;

•

we extinguished $183,147,000 of unsecured senior notes with
    weighted average interest rates of 7.82%; and

•

we completed a public offering of 9,200,000 shares of
    common stock with net proceeds of approximately $356,554,000 in
    September 2009.

Recent
    Events

We completed the following investments in February 2010:

•

We completed the acquisition of a portfolio of 17 medical office
    buildings located in Wisconsin totaling 1.15 million square
    feet through a joint venture with Hammes Company. Our
    $192 million investment includes the assumption of
    $106 million in secured debt at an average rate of 7.35%.
    The assets will be 100%



master leased to Aurora Health Care, an investment grade rated,
    non-profit health system based in Wisconsin. Our initial cash
    yield is 9.1% and the leases have an average remaining term of
    13 years.

•

We formed a $668 million joint venture with Forest City
    Enterprises (NYSE:FCE.A and FCE.B). We acquired a 49% interest
    in a seven-building life sciences campus with 1.2 million
    square feet located in University Park in Cambridge, MA. The
    value of our investment is $327 million. We invested
    $170 million of cash and the joint venture assumed
    $320 million of non-recourse secured debt with a weighted
    average interest rate of 7.1%. Projected 2010 cash net operating
    income for the portfolio is approximately $51 million.

Key
    Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties

We utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the
    various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed
    below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and
    concentration risk. Management uses these key performance
    indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to
    our historical operating results and in making operating
    decisions.

Operating Performance.

We believe that net
    income attributable to common stockholders (“NICS”) is
    the most appropriate earnings measure. Other useful supplemental
    measures of our operating performance include funds from
    operations (“FFO”) and net operating income
    (“NOI”); however, these supplemental measures are not
    defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“U.S. GAAP”). Please refer to the section
    entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for
    further discussion of FFO and NOI and for reconciliations of FFO
    and NOI. These earnings measures and their relative per share
    amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the
    valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of REITs.
    The following table reflects the recent historical trends of our
    operating performance measures (in thousands, except per share

Credit Strength.

We measure our credit
    strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios.
    Our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization, debt to
    undepreciated book capitalization and debt to market
    capitalization. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our
    balance sheet capitalization is related to total debt. Our
    coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge
    coverage ratio. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to
    service interest and fixed charges (interest plus preferred
    dividends and secured debt principal amortizations). We expect
    to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient
    to maintain investment grade ratings with Moody’s Investors
    Service, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
    Fitch Ratings. The coverage ratios are based on adjusted
    earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    (“Adjusted EBITDA”) which is discussed in further
    detail, and reconciled to net income, below in
    “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Leverage ratios
    and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and
    rating agencies in the valuation, comparison,



investment recommendations and rating of companies. The

Concentration Risk.

We evaluate our
    concentration risk in terms of asset mix, investment mix,
    customer mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a
    valuable measure in understanding what portion of our
    investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to
    experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our
    investments that are real property. In order to qualify as an
    equity REIT, at least 75% of our real estate investments must be
    real property whereby each property, which includes the land,
    buildings, improvements, intangibles and related rights, is
    owned by us and leased to an operator pursuant to a long-term
    operating lease. Investment mix measures the portion of our
    investments that relate to our various property types. Customer
    mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our
    top five customers. Geographic mix measures the portion of our
    investments that relate to our top five states. The following
    table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration
    risk:

We evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with
    current expectations to determine if historical trends are
    indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be
    achieved and actual results may differ



materially from our expectations. Management regularly monitors
    various economic and other factors to develop strategic and
    tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our
    competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial
    objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute
    these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic
    and company-specific trends. Please refer to
    “Item 1A — Risk Factors” above for
    further discussion.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Sources
    and Uses of Cash

Our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts,
    borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangement,
    public and private offerings of debt and equity securities,
    proceeds from the sales of real property and principal payments
    on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend
    distributions, debt service



payments (including principal and interest), real property
    acquisitions, loan advances and general and administrative
    expenses. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are discussed in
    further detail below.

Operating Activities.

The increases in net
    cash provided from operating activities are primarily
    attributable to net income excluding gains/losses on sales of
    real property and impairments. See the discussion of investing
    activities and results of operations below for additional
    details. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional
    properties in the future, our results of operations will change
    accordingly.

Gross straight-line rental income represents the non-cash
    difference between contractual cash rent due and the average
    rent recognized pursuant to U.S. GAAP for leases with fixed
    rental escalators, net of collectability reserves, if any. This
    amount is positive in the first half of a lease term (but
    declining every year due to annual increases in cash rent due)
    and is negative in the second half of a lease term. The
    fluctuation in cash receipts due to real property sales is
    attributable to a decline in straight-line rent receivable
    balances on properties sold. The change in prepaid rent cash
    receipts is due to the mix of real property acquisitions during
    the periods presented. We typically receive prepaid rent in
    connection with investment property acquisitions.



Investing Activities.

The changes in net cash
    used in investing activities are primarily attributable to
    changes in loans receivable and real property investments. The

2007 includes the Rendina/Paramount
    acquisition.



The investment in Rendina/Paramount primarily represented cash
    consideration of $141,967,000 offset by $4,000 of cash assumed
    from Paramount.

Financing Activities.

The changes in net cash
    provided from or used in financing activities are primarily
    attributable to changes related to our debt, common stock
    issuances, and cash distributions to stockholders.

The changes in our senior unsecured notes include: (i) the
    issuance $400,000,000 of our 4.75% convertible senior unsecured
    notes in July 2007; (ii) the extinguishment of $52,500,000
    of 7.5% senior unsecured notes in August 2007;
    (iii) the extinguishment of $42,330,000 of
    7.625% senior unsecured notes in March 2008; and
    (iv) the extinguishment of $183,147,000 of senior unsecured
    notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 7.82% in 2009 and
    recognized extinguishment losses of $19,269,000.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we extinguished 20
    secured debt loans totaling $81,715,000 with a weighted-average
    interest rate of 7.21% and recognized extinguishment losses of
    $5,838,000. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we
    extinguished eight secured debt loans totaling $50,475,000 with
    a weighted-average interest rate of 6.67% and recognized
    extinguishment gains of $2,094,000. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we extinguished five secured debt loans
    totaling $29,797,000 with a weighted-average interest rate of
    7.34%.

In November 2007, we repurchased $50,000,000 liquidation amount
    of preferred securities of a subsidiary trust and, in December
    2007, obtained the satisfaction and discharge of a related
    $51,000,000 liability of an operating partnership and recorded a
    $1,081,000 gain on extinguishment of debt.

The change in common stock is primarily attributable to public
    issuances and issuances under our dividend reinvestment and
    stock purchase plan (“DRIP”) and our equity shelf
    program. The remaining difference in common stock issuances is
    primarily due to issuances pursuant to stock incentive plans.

In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (including
    100% of capital gains) to our stockholders. The increases in
    dividends are primarily attributable to increases in the number
    of outstanding common and preferred shares as discussed above,
    increases in our annual



common stock dividend per share and the payment of a prorated
    dividend of $0.2991 in February 2007 as a result of the $0.3409
    prorated dividend paid in December 2006 in conjunction with the
    Windrose merger.

    and 2013. Please see Note 10 to our consolidated financial
    statements for additional information.

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may or
    may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge
    interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on
    the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates, our
    perception of the future volatility of interest rates and our
    relative levels of variable rate debt and variable rate
    investments. Please see Note 9 to our audited consolidated

Amounts represent principal amounts
    due and do not reflect unamortized premiums/discounts or other
    fair value adjustments as reflected on the balance sheet.

At December 31, 2009, we had an unsecured credit
    arrangement with a consortium of sixteen banks providing for a
    revolving line of credit in the amount of $1,150,000,000, which
    is scheduled to expire on August 5, 2011 (with the ability
    to extend for one year at our discretion if we are in compliance
    with all covenants). Borrowings under the agreement are subject
    to interest payable in periods no longer than three months at
    either the agent bank’s prime rate of interest or the
    applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate, at our option (0.84%
    at December 31, 2009). The applicable margin is based on
    our ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.6%
    at December 31, 2009. In addition, we pay a facility fee
    annually to each bank based on the bank’s



commitment under the revolving credit facility. The facility fee
    depends on our ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.15%
    at December 31, 2009. We also pay an annual agent’s
    fee of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the
    agreement. At December 31, 2009, we had $140,000,000
    outstanding under the unsecured line of credit arrangement and
    estimated total contractual interest obligations of $2,196,000.
    Contractual interest obligations are estimated based on the
    assumption that the balance of $140,000,000 at December 31,
    2009 is constant until maturity at interest rates in effect at
    December 31, 2009.

We have $1,661,853,000 of senior unsecured notes principal
    outstanding with fixed annual interest rates ranging from 4.75%
    to 8.0%, payable semi-annually. Total contractual interest
    obligations on senior unsecured notes totaled $904,406,000 at
    December 31, 2009. $735,000,000 of our senior unsecured
    notes are convertible notes that also contain put features.
    Please see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements
    for additional information.

Additionally, we have secured debt with total outstanding
    principal of $623,046,000, collateralized by owned properties,
    with annual interest rates ranging from 4.89% to 6.99%, payable
    monthly. The carrying values of the properties securing the
    mortgage loans totaled $901,013,000 at December 31, 2009.
    Total contractual interest obligations on mortgage loans totaled
    $201,633,000 at December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2009, we had operating lease obligations of
    $182,040,000 relating primarily to ground leases at certain of
    our properties and office space leases.

Purchase obligations are comprised of unfunded construction
    commitments and contingent purchase obligations. At
    December 31, 2009, we had outstanding construction
    financings of $456,832,000 for leased properties and were
    committed to providing additional financing of approximately
    $213,945,000 to complete construction. At December 31,
    2009, we had contingent purchase obligations totaling
    $10,320,000. These contingent purchase obligations primarily
    relate to deferred acquisition fundings and capital
    improvements. Deferred acquisition fundings are contingent upon
    a tenant satisfying certain conditions in the lease. Upon
    funding, amounts due from the tenant are increased to reflect
    the additional investment in the property.

Other long-term liabilities relate to our Supplemental Executive
    Retirement Plan (“SERP”) and certain non-compete
    agreements. We have a SERP, a non-qualified defined benefit
    pension plan, which provides one executive officer with
    supplemental deferred retirement benefits. The SERP provides an
    opportunity for participants to receive retirement benefits that
    cannot be paid under our tax-qualified plans because of the
    restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended. Benefits are based on compensation and length
    of service and the SERP is unfunded. No contributions by the
    Company are anticipated for the 2010 fiscal year. Benefit
    payments are expected to total $4,758,000 during the next five
    fiscal years and no benefit payments are expected to occur
    during the succeeding five fiscal years. We use a December 31
    measurement date for the SERP. The accrued liability on our
    balance sheet for the SERP was $3,287,000 at December 31,
    2009 ($3,109,000 at December 31, 2008).

In connection with the Windrose merger, we entered into
    consulting agreements with Fred S. Klipsch and Frederick L.
    Farrar, which expired in December 2008. We entered into a new
    consulting agreement with Mr. Farrar in December 2008,
    which expired in December 2009. Each consultant has agreed not
    to compete with the Company for a period of two years following
    termination or expiration of the agreement. In exchange for
    complying with the covenant not to compete, Messers. Klipsch and
    Farrar are entitled to receive eight quarterly payments of
    $75,000 and $37,500, respectively, with the first payment to be
    made on the date of termination or expiration of the agreement.
    The first payment to Mr. Klipsch was made in December 2008.
    The first payment to Mr. Farrar was made in January 2010.

Capital
    Structure

As of December 31, 2009, we had stockholders’ equity
    of $3,807,451,000 and a total outstanding debt balance of
    $2,414,022,000, which represents a debt to total book
    capitalization ratio of 39%. Our ratio of debt to market
    capitalization was 30% at December 31, 2009. For the twelve
    months ended December 31, 2009, our adjusted interest
    coverage ratio was 3.78 to 1.00. For the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2009, our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio
    was 3.09 to 1.00. Also, at December 31, 2009, we had
    $35,476,000 of cash and cash equivalents,



$23,237,000 of restricted cash and $1,010,000,000 of available
    borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require
    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth
    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
    create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of
    December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all of the
    covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements
    contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by
    our debt ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. However,
    under our unsecured line of credit arrangement, these ratings on
    our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and
    interest payable.

As of February 12, 2010, our senior unsecured notes were
    rated Baa2 (stable), BBB- (positive) and BBB (stable) by
    Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s
    Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, respectively. We plan to
    manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a
    capital structure consistent with our current profile. Any
    downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the
    noted rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on
    our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition.

On May 7, 2009, we filed an open-ended automatic or
    “universal” shelf registration statement with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission covering an indeterminate
    amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock,
    preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units. As of
    February 12, 2010, we had an effective registration
    statement on file in connection with our enhanced DRIP program
    under which we may issue up to 10,760,247 shares of common
    stock. As of February 12, 2010, 6,402,507 shares of
    common stock remained available for issuance under this
    registration statement. In November 2008, we entered into an
    Equity Distribution Agreement with UBS Securities LLC relating
    to the offer and sale from time to time of up to $250,000,000
    aggregate amount of our common stock (“Equity Shelf
    Program”). As of February 12, 2010, we had
    $139,356,000 of remaining capacity under the Equity Shelf
    Program. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing
    securities under our registration statements to invest in
    additional properties and to repay borrowings under our
    unsecured line of credit arrangement.

We evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our
    two business segments — investment properties and
    medical office buildings. Under the investment property segment,
    properties are primarily leased under

triple-net

leases and we are not involved in the management of the
    property. Under the medical office building segment, our
    properties are typically leased under gross leases, modified
    gross leases or

triple-net

leases, to multiple tenants, and generally require a certain
    level of property management. There are no intersegment sales or
    transfers. Non-segment revenue consists mainly of interest
    income on non-real estate investments and other income. Non-



property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to
    individual segments in determining net operating income. Please
    see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

The increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the
    acquisitions of new investment properties from which we receive
    rent. See the discussion of investing activities in
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above for further
    information. Certain of our leases contain annual rental
    escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer
    Price Index

and/or

changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s
    properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line
    rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If
    gross operating revenues at our facilities

and/or

the
    Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues
    may not continue to increase. Sales of real property would
    offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new
    acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues. Our leases
    could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an
    increase or decrease in rental income. Interest income increased
    from 2007 primarily due to an increase in the balance of
    outstanding loans.



Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007 represents $12,229,000, $7,176,000 and $8,763,000,
    respectively, of secured debt interest expense offset by
    interest allocated to discontinued operations. The change in
    secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and
    timing of assumptions, extinguishments and principal
    amortizations. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we
    extinguished 12 investment property secured debt loans and
    recognized extinguishment losses of $2,057,000. During the year
    ended December 31, 2008, we extinguished four investment
    property secured debt loans and recognized extinguishment gains
    of $808,000. The following is a summary of our investment
    property secured debt principal activity (dollars in thousands):

Depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of
    additional investments in properties owned directly by us. See
    the discussion of investing activities in “Liquidity and
    Capital Resources” above for additional details. To the
    extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in
    the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will
    change accordingly.

At December 31, 2009, we had two skilled nursing facilities
    and one hospital that satisfied the requirements for held for
    sale treatment. We did not recognize an impairment loss on the
    skilled nursing facilities as the fair value less estimated
    costs to sell exceeded our carrying value. In determining the
    fair value of the hospital, we used a combination of third party
    appraisals based on market comparable transactions, other market
    listings and asset quality. Management’s estimates
    projected that the carrying value of the asset was more than the
    estimated fair value and an impairment charge of $10,266,000 was
    recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair value less
    costs to sell. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we
    sold 23 investment properties with carrying values of
    $141,996,000 for net gains of $46,439,000. The following
    illustrates the reclassification impact as a result of
    classifying investment properties as discontinued operations for
    the periods presented. Please refer to Note 3 to our
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

During the three months ended December 31, 2007, we
    recognized $3,900,000 of additional other income related to the
    payoff of a warrant equity investment. During the three months
    ended March 31, 2008, we determined that $1,325,000 of
    income taxes were due in connection with that investment gain.
    During the three months ended December 31, 2008, we
    recognized $2,500,000 of additional other income related to a
    lease termination. During the three months ended
    December 31, 2009, we recognized $8,059,000 of additional
    other income related to a lease termination, which is included
    in discontinued operations, and $2,400,000 of prepayment fees.



As a result of our quarterly evaluations, we recorded
    $23,261,000 of provision for loan losses during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. This amount includes the write-off of
    loans totaling $25,578,000 primarily relating to certain early
    stage senior housing operators offset by a net reduction in the
    allowance for loan losses of $2,457,000. The provision for loan
    losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the
    allowance for loan losses and is discussed below in
    “Critical Accounting Policies.”

In May 2007, we completed the acquisition of 17 medical office
    buildings and Paramount Real Estate Services, a property
    management company, from affiliates of Rendina Companies. The
    results of operations for these properties and Paramount have
    been included in our consolidated results of operations from the
    date of acquisition and represent the primary component of
    change in results of operations for this segment from 2007 to
    2008.

The increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the
    acquisitions of medical office buildings from which we receive
    rent. See the discussion of investing activities in
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above for further
    information. Certain of our leases contain annual rental
    escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer
    Price Index. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line
    rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If the
    Consumer Price Index does not increase, a portion of our
    revenues may not continue to increase. Sales of real property
    would offset revenue



increases and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions,
    could result in decreased revenues. Our leases could renew above
    or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or
    decrease in rental income. The increase in other income is
    attributable to third party management fee income.

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007 represents $20,584,000, $21,828,000, and
    $20,174,000, respectively, of secured debt interest expense
    offset by interest allocated to discontinued operations.
    Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 also
    includes $3,104,000 of interest expense related to the trust
    preferred liability. The change in secured debt interest expense
    is primarily due to the net effect and timing of assumptions,
    extinguishments and principal amortizations. During the year
    ended December 31, 2009, we extinguished eight medical
    office building secured debt loans and recognized extinguishment
    losses of $3,781,000. During the year ended December 31,
    2008, we extinguished four medical office building secured debt
    loans and recognized extinguishment gains of $1,286,000. The
    following is a summary of our medical office building secured
    debt principal activity (dollars in thousands):

At January 1, 2007, we had $51,000,000 of trust preferred
    liability principal outstanding with a fixed annual interest
    rate of 7.22%. On November 6, 2007, we purchased all
    $50,000,000 of the outstanding trust preferred securities at par
    for the purpose of unwinding this financing arrangement and
    extinguishing the liability of the operating partnership to the
    subsidiary trust and recorded a $1,081,000 gain on
    extinguishment of debt.

The increase in property operating expenses is primarily
    attributable to the acquisition of new medical office buildings
    for which we incur certain property operating expenses offset by
    property operating expenses associated with discontinued
    operations.

Depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of
    additional investments in properties owned directly by us. See
    the discussion of investing activities in “Liquidity and
    Capital Resources” above for additional details. To the
    extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in
    the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will
    change accordingly.

Income tax expense is related to third party management fee
    income.

At December 31, 2009, we had seven medical office buildings
    that satisfied the requirements for held for sale treatment. In
    determining the fair value of the assets, we used a combination
    of third party appraisals based on market comparable
    transactions, other market listings and asset quality as well as
    management calculations based on projected net operating income
    and published capitalization rates. Management’s estimates
    projected that the carrying value of the assets was more than
    the estimated fair value and an impairment charge of $14,957,000
    was recorded to reduce the properties to their estimated fair
    value. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 13
    medical office buildings with carrying values of $44,717,000 for
    a loss of $3,045,000. The following illustrates the



reclassification impact as a result of classifying these medical
    office buildings as discontinued operations for the periods
    presented. Please refer to Note 3 to our consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion.

The change in interest expense on unsecured lines of credit

We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used
    to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us.
    The amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding
    during the construction period using the rate of interest that
    approximates our cost of financing. Our interest expense is
    reduced by the amount capitalized. Capitalized interest for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 totaled
    $12,526,000, $25,029,000 and $41,170,000, respectively.

Please see Note 9 to our unaudited consolidated financial
    statements for a discussion of our interest rate swap agreements
    and their impact on interest expense.

Loan expense represents the amortization of deferred loan costs
    incurred in connection with the issuance and amendments of debt.
    The change in loan expense is primarily due to costs associated
    with the issuance of $400,000,000 of senior unsecured
    convertible notes in July 2007 and costs associated with the
    extension and expansion of our unsecured line of credit in
    August 2007.

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of
    consolidated revenues (including revenues from discontinued
    operations) for the year ended December 31, 2009 were
    8.33%, as compared with 8.24% and 7.64% for the same periods in
    2008 and 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we
    recorded $1,750,000 of one-



time acquisition finders’ fees paid to former Windrose
    management in connection with the closing of the
    Rendina/Paramount transaction. These fees relate to services
    rendered prior to the consummation of the Windrose merger in
    December 2006. Due to the recipients’ then current
    employment status with the company, the fees were expensed as
    compensation rather than included in the purchase price of the
    acquisition, as is typical with such fees. The increase from
    2007 to 2008 is primarily due to $2,291,000 of non-recurring
    terminated transaction costs and costs associated with our
    initiatives to attract and retain appropriate personnel to
    achieve our business objectives. The terminated transaction
    costs primarily related to the termination of the
    Arcapita/Sunrise agreement. The increase from 2008 to 2009 is
    primarily due to $3,909,000 of non-recurring expenses recognized
    in connection with the departure of Raymond W. Braun who
    formerly served as president of the company.

The change in preferred dividends is primarily due to the change
    in average outstanding preferred shares. The following is a

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures

We believe that net income attributable to common stockholders,
    as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings
    measurement. However, we consider FFO to be a useful
    supplemental measure of our operating performance. Historical
    cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate
    assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the
    provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values
    have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many
    industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of
    operating results for real estate companies that use historical
    cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National
    Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
    (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental measure of
    operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost
    depreciation from net income attributable to common
    stockholders. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income
    attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real
    estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after
    adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Net operating income (“NOI”) is used to evaluate the
    operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as total
    revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property
    operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization,
    general and administrative expenses, impairments and interest
    expense. We believe NOI provides investors relevant and useful
    information because it measures the operating performance of our
    properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use
    NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess
    the property level performance of our properties.

EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization. A covenant in our line of credit arrangement
    contains a financial ratio based on a definition of EBITDA that
    is specific to that agreement. Failure to satisfy this covenant
    could result in an event of default that could have a material
    adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which
    could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    results of operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition. Due to the materiality of this debt
    agreement and the financial covenant, we have disclosed Adjusted
    EBITDA, which represents EBITDA as defined above and adjusted
    for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses
    and gain/loss on extinguishment of debt. We use Adjusted EBITDA
    to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which
    represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges on a
    trailing twelve months basis. Fixed charges include total
    interest (excluding capitalized interest), secured debt
    principal amortization and preferred dividends. Our covenant
    requires an adjusted fixed charge ratio of at least 1.75 times.



Other than Adjusted EBITDA, our supplemental reporting measures
    and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by
    investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the
    valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of
    companies. Management uses these financial measures to
    facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical
    operating results and in making operating decisions.
    Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of
    Directors to evaluate management. Adjusted EBITDA is used solely
    to determine our compliance with a financial covenant of our
    line of credit arrangement and is not being presented for use by
    investors for any other purpose. None of our supplemental
    measures represent net income or cash flow provided from
    operating activities as determined in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative
    measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the
    supplemental reporting measures, as defined by us, may not be
    comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real
    estate investment trusts or other companies. Multi-period
    amounts may not equal the sum of the individual quarterly
    amounts due to rounding.

The table below reflects the reconciliation of FFO to net income
    attributable to common stockholders, the most directly
    comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented.
    The provisions for depreciation and amortization include
    provisions for depreciation and amortization from discontinued
    operations. Amounts are in thousands except for per share data.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
    with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and
    assumptions. Management considers accounting estimates or
    assumptions critical if:

•

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to
    the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for
    highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters
    to change; and

•

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial
    condition or operating performance is material.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its
    critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
    disclosure presented below relating to them. Management believes
    the current assumptions and other considerations used to
    estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial
    statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to
    change in the future. However, since these estimates require
    assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the
    estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual
    experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations
    used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated
    financial statements, the resulting changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition. Please refer to Note 1 of our audited
    consolidated financial statements for further information on
    significant accounting policies that impact us. There were no
    material changes to these policies in 2009.



The following table presents information about our critical
    accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to
    develop each estimate:

Nature of Critical

Assumptions/

Accounting Estimate

Approach Used

Allowance for Losses on Loans Receivable

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed
    adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The
    determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly
    evaluation of all outstanding loans. If this evaluation
    indicates that there is a greater risk of loan charge-offs,
    additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be
    required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information
    and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all
    amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of
    the original loan agreement. Consistent with this definition,
    all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. To the extent
    circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is
    diminished, we will return these loans to full accrual status.

The determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly
    evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic
    conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments and
    principal. We evaluate the collectability of our loans
    receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not
    limited to, delinquency status, historical loan charge-offs,
    financial strength of the borrower and guarantors and value of
    the underlying property.

As a result of our quarterly evaluations, we recorded
    $23,261,000 of provisions for loan losses during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.  This amount includes the write-off of loans
    totaling $25,578,000 primarily relating to certain early stage
    senior housing operators offset by a reduction in the allowance
    for loan losses of $2,457,000.  This results in an allowance for
    loan losses of $5,183,000 relating to loans with outstanding
    balances of $82,353,000 at December 31, 2009.  Also at December
    31, 2009, we had real estate loans with outstanding balances of
    $67,126,000 on non-accrual status.

Business Combinations

Substantially all of the properties owned by us are leased under
    operating leases and are recorded at cost. The cost of our real
    property is allocated to land, buildings, improvements and
    intangibles.

We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using
    the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives
    which range from 15 to 40 years for buildings and five to
    15 years for improvements. Lives for intangibles are based
    on the remaining term of the underlying leases.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $121,510,000,
    $33,690,000 and $9,722,000 as provisions for depreciation and
    amortization relating to buildings, improvements and
    intangibles, respectively, including amounts reclassified as
    discontinued operations. The average useful life of our
    buildings, improvements and intangibles was 36.7 years,
    10.9 years and 8.4 years, respectively, for the year
    ended December 31, 2009.



Nature of Critical

Assumptions/

Accounting Estimate

Approach Used

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically review our long-lived assets for potential
    impairment. An impairment charge must be recognized when the
    carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. The
    carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the
    undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
    eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that a
    permanent impairment of a long-lived asset has occurred, the
    carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value and an
    impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the
    carrying value and the fair value.

The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on
    a property by property basis to determine if there are
    indicators of impairment. These indicators may include
    anticipated operating losses at the property level, the
    tenant’s inability to make rent payments, a decision to
    dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life
    and changes in the market that may permanently reduce the value
    of the property.  If indicators of impairment exist, then the
    undiscounted future cash flows from the most likely use of the
    property are compared to the current net book value. This
    analysis requires us to determine if indicators of impairment
    exist and to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows to be
    generated from the property during the period the property is
    expected to be held.

At December 31, 2009, we had seven medical office buildings, two
    skilled nursing facilities and one hospital that satisfied the
    requirements for held for sale treatment.  During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, impairment charges of $25,223,000 were
    recorded to further reduce the carrying value of the assets to
    their estimated fair value less costs to sell.  In determining
    the fair value of the assets, we used a combination of third
    party appraisals based on market comparable transactions, other
    market listings and asset quality as well as third party offers
    to purchase.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

The valuation of derivative instruments requires companies to
    record derivatives at fair market value on the balance sheet as
    assets or liabilities.

The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
    instruments.  Fair values for our derivatives are estimated by
    utilizing pricing models that consider forward yield curves and
    discount rates.  Such amounts and the recognition of such
    amounts are subject to significant estimates which may change in
    the future. At December 31, 2009, we participated in two
    interest rate swap agreements which are reported at their fair
    value of $2,381,000 and are included in other liabilities with
    the change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
    income.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires
    that revenue be recognized after four basic criteria are met.
    These four criteria include persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and determinable
    income and reasonably assured collectability. If the
    collectability of revenue is determined incorrectly, the amount
    and timing of our reported revenue could be significantly
    affected. Interest income on loans is recognized as earned based
    upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation
    of collectability risk. Substantially all of our operating
    leases contain fixed and/or contingent escalating rent
    structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial
    lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental
    income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is
    generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments
    due for the period.

We evaluate the collectability of our revenues and related
    receivables on an on-going basis.  We evaluate collectability
    based on assumptions and other considerations including, but not
    limited to, the certainty of payment, payment history, the
    financial strength of the investment’s underlying
    operations as measured by cash flows and payment coverages, the
    value of the underlying collateral and guaranties and current
    economic conditions.

If our evaluation indicates that collectability is not
    reasonably assured, we may place an investment on non-accrual or
    reserve against all or a portion of current income as an offset
    to revenue.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $40,885,000
    of interest income and $539,911,000 of rental income, including
    discontinued operations. Cash receipts on leases with deferred
    revenue provisions were $30,674,000 as compared to gross
    straight-line rental income recognized of $19,415,000 for the
    year ended December 31, 2009.  At December 31, 2009, our net
    straight-line receivable balance was $79,760,000, net of
    reserves totaling $273,000.  Also at December 31, 2009, we had
    real estate loans with outstanding balances of $67,126,000 on
    non-accrual status.

Impact of
    Inflation

During the past three years, inflation has not significantly
    affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate.
    Additionally, our earnings are primarily long-term investments
    with fixed rates of return. These



investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity,
    senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our unsecured lines
    of credit arrangements. During inflationary periods, which
    generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability
    to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new
    investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing
    costs. Presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and
    long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we
    believe that inflation will not impact the availability of
    equity and debt financing for us.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We seek to
    mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by
    matching the terms of new investments with new long-term fixed
    rate borrowings to the extent possible. We may or may not elect
    to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate
    exposure. These decisions are principally based on our policy to
    match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings,
    but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the
    applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of
    interest rates. This section is presented to provide a
    discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations
    in interest rates.

We historically borrow on our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement to acquire, construct or make loans relating to
    health care and senior housing properties. Then, as market
    conditions dictate, we will issue equity or long-term fixed rate
    debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured line of credit
    arrangement.

A change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense
    associated with our fixed rate debt. Interest rate changes,
    however, will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt.
    Changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this
    fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows
    and earnings, depending on whether the debt is replaced with
    other fixed rate debt, variable rate debt or equity or repaid by
    the sale of assets. To illustrate the impact of changes in the
    interest rate markets, we performed a sensitivity analysis on
    our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in
    net present values arising from a hypothetical 1% increase in
    interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair
    value. The following table summarizes the analysis performed as
    of the dates indicated (in thousands):

On August 7, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap
    (the “August 2009 Swap”) for a total notional amount
    of $52,198,000 to hedge seven years of interest payments
    associated with long-term LIBOR based borrowings. The August
    2009 Swap has an effective date of August 12, 2009 and a
    maturity date of September 1, 2016. The August 2009 Swap
    has the economic effect of fixing $52,198,000 at 3.93% plus a
    credit spread for seven years. The August 2009 Swap has been
    designated as a cash flow hedge and we expect it to be highly
    effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest
    payments on $52,198,000 of long-term debt due to changes in the
    LIBOR swap rate.

On September 28, 2009, we entered into an interest rate
    swap (the “September 2009 Swap”) for a total notional
    amount of $48,155,000 to hedge seven years of interest payments
    associated with long-term LIBOR based borrowings. The September
    2009 Swap has an effective date of September 30, 2009 and a
    maturity date of October 1, 2016. The September 2009 Swap
    has the economic effect of fixing $48,155,000 at 3.2675% plus a
    credit spread for seven years. The September 2009 Swap has been
    designated as a cash flow hedge and we expect it to be highly
    effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest
    payments on $48,155,000 of long-term debt due to changes in the
    LIBOR swap rate.

Our variable rate debt, including our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, is reflected at fair value. At December 31,
    2009, we had $140,000,000 outstanding related to our variable
    rate line of credit and $131,952,000 outstanding related to our
    variable rate secured debt. Assuming no changes in outstanding
    balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in
    increased annual interest expense of $2,720,000. At
    December 31, 2008, we had



$570,000,000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and
    assuming no changes in outstanding balances, a 1% increase in
    interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest
    expense of $5,700,000.

We are subject to risks associated with debt financing,
    including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be
    refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as
    favorable as the terms of current indebtedness. The majority of
    our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual
    agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.
    Accordingly, in the event that we are unable to raise additional
    equity or borrow money because of these limitations, our ability
    to acquire additional properties may be limited.

For additional information regarding fair values of financial
    instruments, see “Item 7 — Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Critical Accounting Policies” and

Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Health Care REIT, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedules listed in
    Item 15(a) (2) of this

Form 10-K.

These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility
    of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Health Care REIT, Inc. at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
    have been retrospectively adjusted for the adoption of new
    accounting standards which changed the presentation of
    noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and the accounting for
    convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon
    conversion.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Health Care REIT, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Accounting
    Policies and Related Matters

Business

Health Care REIT, Inc., an S&P 500 company with
    headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, is an equity real estate
    investment trust (“REIT”) that invests in senior
    housing and health care real estate. Our full service platform
    also offers property management and development services to our
    customers. As of December 31, 2009, our broadly diversified
    portfolio consisted of 590 properties in 39 states. Founded
    in 1970, we were the first real estate investment trust to
    invest exclusively in health care facilities. More information
    is available on our website at www.hcreit.com.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the
    accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of
    our majority owned and controlled joint ventures. All material
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which
    requires that revenue be recognized after four basic criteria
    are met. These four criteria include persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and determinable
    income and reasonably assured collectability. Interest income on
    loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount
    outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectability risk.
    Substantially all of our operating leases contain either fixed
    or contingent escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed
    annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a
    collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with
    contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the
    contractual cash rental payments due for the period.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid
    investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash primarily consists of amounts held by lenders to
    provide future payments for real estate taxes, insurance, tenant
    and capital improvements and amounts held in escrow relating to
    acquisitions we are entitled to receive over a period of time as
    outlined in the escrow agreement.

Deferred
    Loan Expenses

Deferred loan expenses are costs incurred by us in connection
    with the issuance, assumption and amendments of debt
    arrangements. We amortize these costs over the term of the debt
    using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective
    interest method.



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Equity
    Investments

Equity investments at December 31, 2009 and 2008 include an
    investment in a public company that has a readily determinable
    fair market value. We classify this equity investment as

available-for-sale

and, accordingly, record this investment at its fair market
    value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income, a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. Equity investments at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 also include an investment in a
    private company. We do not have the ability to exercise
    influence over the company, so the investment is accounted for
    under the cost method. Under the cost method of accounting,
    investments in private companies are carried at cost and are
    adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value, return of capital and additional
    investments. These equity investments represented a minimal
    ownership interest in these companies. Additionally, equity
    investments at December 31, 2009 include an investment in
    an unconsolidated joint venture.

Investments
    in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for
    which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over
    operating and financial policies are reported under the equity
    method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our
    share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in
    our consolidated results of operations. The initial carrying
    value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based
    on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the
    estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of
    interests in the joint venture. We evaluate our equity method
    investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the
    estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its
    carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated
    fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is

other-than-temporary,

an impairment is recorded.

Real
    Property Owned

Real property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the
    capitalization of construction period interest. The cost of real
    property acquired is allocated to net tangible and identifiable
    intangible assets based on their respective fair values.
    Substantially all of the properties owned by us are leased under
    operating leases and are recorded at cost. These properties are
    depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
    lives which range from 15 to 40 years for buildings and
    five to 15 years for improvements. We consider costs
    incurred in conjunction with re-leasing properties, including
    tenant improvements and lease commissions, to represent the
    acquisition of productive assets and, accordingly, such costs
    are reflected as investment activities in our statement of cash
    flows.

The remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable
    intangible assets primarily consisting of the above or below
    market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place
    leases. The value allocable to the above or below market
    component of the acquired in-place lease is determined based
    upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the
    risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference
    between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to
    the lease over its remaining term, and
    (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would
    be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the
    lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included
    in acquired lease intangibles and below market leases are
    included in other liabilities in the balance sheet and are
    amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the
    respective leases.

The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further
    allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship
    values based on management’s evaluation of the specific
    characteristics of each tenant’s lease and the
    Company’s overall relationship with that respective tenant.
    Characteristics considered by management in allocating these
    values include the nature and extent of the Company’s
    existing business relationships with the tenant, growth
    prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the
    tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals,



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

among other factors. The estimated aggregate amortization
    expense for acquired lease intangibles is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted average period of 30.0 years and
    is as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):

The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on
    a property by property basis to determine if facts and
    circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that
    the depreciable life may need to be changed. We consider
    external factors relating to each asset. If these external
    factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of the asset
    over the remaining depreciation period indicate that the asset
    will not be recoverable, the carrying value is reduced to the
    estimated fair market value.

Capitalization
    of Construction Period Interest

We capitalize interest costs associated with funds used to
    finance the construction of properties owned directly by us. The
    amount capitalized is based upon the balance outstanding during
    the construction period using the rate of interest which
    approximates our cost of financing. We capitalized interest
    costs of $41,170,000, $25,029,000, and $12,526,000 during 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, related to construction of real
    property owned by us. Our interest expense reflected in the
    consolidated statements of income has been reduced by the
    amounts capitalized.

Gain
    on Sale of Assets

We recognize sales of assets only upon the closing of the
    transaction with the purchaser. Payments received from
    purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and
    classified as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    Gains on assets sold are recognized using the full accrual
    method upon closing when the collectability of the sales price
    is reasonably assured, we are not obligated to perform
    significant activities after the sale to earn the profit, we
    have received adequate initial investment from the buyer and
    other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may
    be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the
    requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate.

Real
    Estate Loans Receivable

Real estate loans receivable consist of mortgage loans and other
    real estate loans. Interest income on loans is recognized as
    earned based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an
    evaluation of collectability risks. The loans are primarily
    collateralized by a first, second or third mortgage lien, a
    leasehold mortgage on, or an assignment of the partnership
    interest in, the related properties, corporate guaranties

and/or

personal guaranties.

Allowance
    for Losses on Loans Receivable

The allowance for losses on loans receivable is maintained at a
    level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans
    receivable. The determination of the allowance is based on a
    quarterly evaluation of these loans, including general economic
    conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We
    evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a
    combination of factors, including, but not limited to,
    delinquency status, historical loan charge-offs, financial
    strength of the borrower and guarantors and value of the
    underlying collateral. If such factors indicate that there is
    greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or
    placement on non-accrual status may be required. A loan is
    impaired when, based on current information and events, it is
    probable that



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled
    according to the contractual terms of the original loan
    agreement. Consistent with this definition, all loans on
    non-accrual are deemed impaired. At December 31, 2009, we
    had loans with outstanding balances of $67,126,000 on
    non-accrual status ($72,770,000 at December 31, 2008). To
    the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability
    is diminished, we will return these loans to full accrual
    status. While a loan is on non-accrual status, any cash receipts
    are applied against the outstanding principal balance.

Fair
    Value of Derivative Instruments

The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
    instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are estimated by
    utilizing pricing models that consider forward yield curves and
    discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts
    are subject to significant estimates that may change in the
    future. See Note 9 for additional information.

Federal
    Income Tax

No provision has been made for federal income taxes since we
    have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust
    under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
    and we believe that we have met the requirements for
    qualification as such for each taxable year. Our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income
    taxes. See Note 13 for additional information.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
    of shares outstanding for the period adjusted for non-vested
    shares of restricted stock. The computation of diluted earnings
    per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that
    the number of shares is increased to include the number of
    additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
    potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

Segment
    Reporting

We report consolidated financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP. Segments are based on our method of internal
    reporting which classifies operations by leasing activities. Our
    segments include investment properties and medical office
    buildings. See Note 18 for additional information.

New
    Accounting Standards

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) amended the consolidation guidance for
    variable interest entities. The new guidance requires
    enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining
    whether or not a variable interest entity will need to be
    consolidated on a continuous basis. This evaluation will be
    based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence
    the activities of a variable interest entity that most
    significantly impact its economic performance. This amendment is
    effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2009. We do not expect adoption of this
    guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position or results of operations, although additional
    disclosures may be required.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform
    to the current year presentation.

We purchased $23,097,000 of real property that had previously
    been financed by the Company with loans in 2008. We acquired
    properties, which included the assumption of debt totaling
    $166,188,000 in 2007. These non-cash activities are
    appropriately not reflected in the accompanying statements of
    cash flows.

Dispositions,
    Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed the
    sale of 36 properties and recognized $43,394,000 of net gains on
    sales. At December 31, 2009, we had one hospital, two
    skilled nursing facilities and seven medical office buildings
    that satisfied the requirements of held for sale treatment. We
    did not recognize any impairment loss on the skilled nursing
    facilities as the fair value less estimated costs to sell
    exceeded our carrying value. The fair value was estimated based
    on a third party offer to purchase. In determining the fair
    value of the medical office buildings and hospital, we used a
    combination of third party appraisals based on market comparable
    transactions, other market listings and asset quality as well as
    management calculations based on projected net operating income
    and published capitalization rates. Management’s estimates
    projected that the carrying value of the assets was greater than
    the estimated fair value and an impairment charge of $25,223,000
    was recorded to reduce the properties

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we completed the
    sale of 29 properties to Emeritus Corporation for $299,413,000,
    consisting of $249,413,000 in cash proceeds and $50,000,000 of
    seller financing, and we recognized a gain on sale of
    $145,646,000. Total funds of $299,413,000 were held in escrow
    for use in an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchange,
    of which $162,558,000 was utilized during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. We had retained LandAmerica 1031
    Exchange Services, Inc. (“LES”) to act as a qualified
    intermediary. On November 26, 2008, LES and its parent,
    LandAmerica Financial Group, filed for bankruptcy protection. At
    that time, we had approximately $136,855,000 in two segregated
    escrow accounts (the “Exchange Funds”) held by
    Centennial Bank, an affiliate of LES. Although the terms of our
    agreements with LES required that the Exchange Funds be returned
    to us, the return of the Exchange Funds was stayed by the
    bankruptcy proceedings. On February 23, 2009, the United
    States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia,
    Richmond Division, entered an order approving the stipulation
    and settlement agreement among LES, the unsecured creditors
    committees and us. Pursuant to the terms of that settlement
    agreement, the Exchange Funds plus $918,000 of interest were
    returned to us on February 23, 2009, and we made a
    settlement payment of $2,000,000 to the LES bankruptcy estate.
    In connection with these proceedings, we incurred approximately
    $500,000 in expenses. The settlement payment and expenses were
    recorded as reductions of gains on sales in 2008.

Borrowings
    Under Line of Credit Arrangement and Related Items

At December 31, 2009, we had an unsecured credit
    arrangement with a consortium of sixteen banks providing for a
    revolving line of credit in the amount of $1,150,000,000, which
    is scheduled to expire on August 5, 2011 (with the ability
    to extend for one year at our discretion if we are in compliance
    with all covenants). Borrowings under the agreement are subject
    to interest payable in periods no longer than three months at
    either the agent bank’s prime rate of interest or the
    applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate, at our option (0.84%
    at December 31, 2009). The applicable margin is based on
    our ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.6%
    at December 31, 2009. In addition, we pay a facility fee
    annually to each bank based on the bank’s commitment under
    the revolving credit facility. The facility fee depends on our
    ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.15%
    at December 31, 2009. We also pay an annual agent’s
    fee of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the

During the three months ended December 31 2006, we issued
    $345,000,000 of 4.75% senior unsecured convertible notes
    due December 2026, generating net proceeds of $337,517,000. The
    notes are convertible, in certain circumstances, into cash and,
    if applicable, shares of common stock at an initial conversion
    rate of 20.8833 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
    notes, which represents an initial conversion price of
    approximately $47.89 per share. In general, upon conversion, the
    holder of each note would receive, in respect of the conversion
    value of such note, cash up to the principal amount of such note
    and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess
    of such principal amount. In addition, on each of
    December 1, 2011, December 1, 2016 and
    December 1, 2021, holders may require us to purchase all or
    a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
    100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus
    any accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2009,
    we had $340,000,000 of these notes outstanding.

In July 2007, we issued $400,000,000 of 4.75% senior
    unsecured convertible notes due July 2027, generating net
    proceeds of $388,943,000. The notes are convertible, in certain
    circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, shares of our
    common stock at an initial conversion rate of
    20.0000 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which
    represents an initial conversion price of approximately $50.00
    per share. In general, upon conversion, the holder of each note
    would receive, in respect of the conversion value of such note,
    cash up to the principal amount of such note and common stock
    for the note’s conversion value in excess of such principal
    amount. In addition, on each of July 15, 2012,
    July 15, 2017 and July 15, 2022, holders may require
    us to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase
    price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
    to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. As of
    December 31, 2009, we had $395,000,000 of these notes
    outstanding.

We have mortgage loans totaling $620,995,000, collateralized by
    owned properties, with annual interest rates ranging from 4.89%
    to 6.99%. The carrying amounts of the mortgages represent the
    par value of $623,046,000 adjusted for any unamortized fair
    value adjustments. The carrying values of the properties
    securing the mortgage loans totaled $901,013,000 at
    December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, we completed $276,277,000 of first mortgage loans secured
    by 31 senior housing properties with multiple levels of service
    and one commercial office campus. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we extinguished $81,715,000 of secured
    debt prior to maturity and recognized debt extinguishment losses
    of $5,838,000.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require
    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth
    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
    create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of

Derivative
    Instruments

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may
    elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest
    rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on our
    policy to manage the general trend in interest rates at the
    applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of
    interest rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair market value on
    the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The valuation of
    derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and
    judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair
    values for our derivatives are estimated by pricing models that
    consider forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts
    and the recognition of such amounts are subject to significant
    estimates that may change in the future.

The following is a summary of the fair value of our derivative
    instruments (dollars in thousands):

Cash
    Flow Hedges

For instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow
    hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
    derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive
    income (“OCI”), and reclassified into earnings in the
    same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction
    affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative
    representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components
    excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in
    earnings. Approximately $2,893,000 of losses, which are included
    in other comprehensive income, are expected to be reclassified
    into earnings in the next 12 months.

On August 7, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap
    (the “August 2009 Swap”) for a total notional amount
    of $52,198,000 to hedge seven years of interest payments
    associated with long-term LIBOR based borrowings. The August
    2009 Swap has an effective date of August 12, 2009 and a
    maturity date of September 1, 2016. The August 2009 Swap
    has the economic effect of fixing $52,198,000 at 3.93% plus a
    credit spread for seven years. The August 2009 Swap has been
    designated as a cash flow hedge and we expect it to be highly
    effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest
    payments on $52,198,000 of long-term debt due to changes in the
    LIBOR swap rate.

On September 28, 2009, we entered into an interest rate
    swap (the “September 2009 Swap”) for a total notional
    amount of $48,155,000 to hedge seven years of interest payments
    associated with long-term LIBOR based borrowings. The September
    2009 Swap has an effective date of September 30, 2009 and a
    maturity date of October 1, 2016. The September 2009 Swap
    has the economic effect of fixing $48,155,000 at 3.2675% plus a
    credit spread for seven years. The September 2009 Swap has been
    designated as a cash flow hedge and we expect it to be highly
    effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest
    payments on $48,155,000 of long-term debt due to changes in the
    LIBOR swap rate.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized a
    realized loss on derivatives of $23,393,000 related to
    forward-starting interest rate swaps that were in place to hedge
    future debt issuances when the timing of those issuances were
    revised.

Fair
    Value Hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated as a fair value
    hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the
    offsetting loss or gain on the hedged risk are recognized in
    current earnings. There were no outstanding fair value hedges at
    December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding construction
    financings of $456,832,000 for leased properties and were
    committed to providing additional financing of approximately
    $213,945,000 to complete construction. At December 31,
    2009, we had contingent purchase obligations totaling
    $10,320,000. These contingent purchase obligations primarily
    relate to deferred acquisition fundings and capital
    improvements. Deferred acquisition fundings are contingent upon
    an operator satisfying certain conditions such as payment
    coverage and value tests. Amounts due from the tenant are
    increased to reflect the additional investment in the property.

At December 31, 2009, we had operating lease obligations of
    $182,040,000 relating to certain ground leases and Company
    office space. We incurred rental expense relating to our Company
    office space of $1,138,000, $1,452,000 and $678,000 for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Regarding the property leases, we have sublease agreements with
    certain of our operators that require the operators to reimburse
    us for our monthly operating lease obligations. At
    December 31, 2009, aggregate future minimum rentals to be
    received under these noncancelable subleases totaled $33,071,000.

Preferred
    Stock

In July 2003, we closed a public offering of
    4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation
    value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly in
    arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity, may
    be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per share,
    plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to the
    redemption date, on or after July 9, 2008.

In September 2003, we issued 1,060,000 shares of 6%
    Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred
    Stock as partial consideration for an acquisition of assets by
    the Company, with the shares valued at $26,500,000 for such
    purposes. The shares were issued to Southern Assisted Living,
    Inc. and certain of its stockholders without registration in
    reliance upon the federal statutory exemption of
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The
    shares have a liquidation value of $25.00 per share. Dividends
    are payable quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock, which has
    no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us at a redemption price
    of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such
    shares to the redemption date, on or after August 15, 2008.
    The preferred shares are convertible by the holder into common
    stock at a conversion price of $32.66 per share at any time. At
    December 31, 2009, there were 74,380 of such shares
    outstanding.

In September 2004, we closed a public offering of
    7,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series F Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation
    value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly in
    arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity, may
    be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per share,
    plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to the
    redemption date, on or after September 14, 2009.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Windrose Medical
    Properties Trust in December 2006, we issued
    2,100,000 shares of 7.5% Series G Cumulative
    Convertible Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation
    value of $25.00 per share and a book value of $29.58 per share.
    Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock,
    which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us at a
    redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid
    dividends on such shares to the redemption date, on or after
    June 30, 2010. Each Series G Preferred Share is
    convertible by the holder into our common stock at a conversion
    price of $34.93, equivalent to a conversion rate of 0.7157
    common shares per Series G Preferred Share. The
    Series G Preferred Shares require cumulative distributions.
    During the year ended December 31, 2007, certain holders of
    our Series G Preferred Stock converted 295,800 shares
    into 211,702 shares of our common stock, leaving 1,804,200
    of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2007. During the

Stock
    Incentive Plans

Our Amended and Restated 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan
    authorizes up to 6,200,000 shares of common stock to be
    issued at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the
    Board of Directors. The 2005 Plan replaced the 1995 Stock
    Incentive Plan and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors.
    The options granted to officers and key employees under the 1995
    Plan continue to vest through 2010 and expire ten years from the
    date of grant. Our non-employee directors, officers and key
    employees are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. The 2005
    Plan allows for the issuance of, among other things, stock
    options, restricted stock, deferred stock units and dividend
    equivalent rights. Vesting periods for options, deferred stock
    units and restricted shares generally range from three years for
    non-employee directors to five years for officers and key
    employees. Options expire ten years from the date of grant. We
    granted 159,805, 161,101 and 272,057 restricted shares during
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, including 18,243, 14,504 and
    10,717 deferred stock units to non-employee directors in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Option

    grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the

    projected future dividend payments over the expected life of the
    option discounted at the dividend yield rate.



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The dividend yield represented the dividend yield of our common
    stock on the dates of grant. Our computation of expected
    volatility was based on historical volatility. The risk-free
    interest rates used were the

7-year

U.S. Treasury Notes yield on the date of grant for the 2009
    and 2008 grants and the

5-year

U.S. Treasury Notes yield on the date of grant for the 2007
    grants. The expected life was based on historical experience of
    similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms,
    vesting schedules and expectations regarding future employee
    behavior.

in-the-money

at December 31, 2009. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the aggregate intrinsic
    value of options exercised under our stock incentive plans was
    $737,000, $2,042,000 and $6,600,000, respectively, determined as
    of the date of option exercise. Cash received from option
    exercises under our stock incentive plans for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $3,676,000, $3,547,000
    and $17,775,000, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, there was approximately $1,717,000
    of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested
    stock options granted under our stock incentive plans. That cost
    is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    four years. As of December 31, 2009, there was
    approximately $6,492,000 of

We adopted the fair value-based method of accounting for
    share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the
    prospective method. Currently, we use the Black-Scholes-Merton
    option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option
    grants and expect to continue to use this acceptable option
    valuation model. We recognize compensation cost for share-based
    grants on a straight-line basis through the date the awards
    become fully vested or to the retirement eligible date, if
    sooner. Compensation cost totaled $9,633,000, $8,530,000 and
    $7,050,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

Income
    Taxes and Distributions

To qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income
    tax purposes, 90% of taxable income (including 100% of capital
    gains) must be distributed to stockholders. Real estate
    investment trusts that do not distribute a certain amount of
    current year taxable income in the current year are also subject
    to a 4% federal excise tax. The main differences between
    undistributed net income for federal income tax purposes and
    financial statement purposes are the recognition of
    straight-line rent for reporting purposes, differing useful
    lives and depreciation and amortization methods for real
    property and the provision for loan losses for reporting
    purposes versus bad debt expense for tax purposes. At
    December 31, 2009, we had U.S. federal tax losses of
    $18,616,000, as well as apportioned state tax losses of
    $17,297,000 available for carryforward. Valuation allowances
    have been provided for those items for which, based upon an
    assessment, it is more likely than not that some portion may not
    be realized. The U.S. federal and state tax loss
    carryforwards expire from 2010 through 2030.

Cash distributions paid to common stockholders, for federal
    income tax purposes, are as follows:

    income taxes were due in connection with that investment gain.

    2007, respectively, because the exercise price was greater than
    the average market price. The Series E Cumulative
    Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series G
    Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock were not included in the
    calculations for 2009, 2008 and 2007 as the effect of the
    conversions was anti-dilutive to income from continuing
    operations attributable to common stockholders (the
    “control number” as defined in U.S. GAAP). The
    $340,000,000 Convertible Senior Notes due December 2026 were not
    included in the calculation for 2009 and 2007 as the effect of
    the conversion was anti-dilutive. The $395,000,000 Convertible
    Senior Notes due July 2027 were not included in the calculation
    for 2009, 2008 and 2007 as the effect of the conversion was
    anti-dilutive.

We adopted FASB authoritative guidance on determining whether
    instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are
    participating securities, effective January 1, 2009, which
    required retrospective application. The guidance clarifies that
    instruments granted in share-based payment transactions that are
    considered to be participating securities prior to vesting
    should be included in the earnings allocation under the
    two-class method of calculating earnings per share. We
    determined that our restricted shares granted under our
    long-term incentive plans are participating securities because
    the restricted shares participate in non-forfeitable dividends
    prior to vesting. Applying the guidance did not have an impact
    on the amounts for any period presented.

Disclosure
    about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it
    is practicable to estimate that value.

Mortgage Loans and Other Real Estate Loans
    Receivable

— The fair value of mortgage loans and
    other real estate loans receivable is generally estimated by
    discounting the estimated future cash flows using the current
    rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with
    similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The carrying amount
    approximates fair value.

Equity Investments

— Available-for-sale
    investments are recorded at their fair market value. Other
    equity investments are recorded at cost which approximates fair
    value.

Borrowings Under Unsecured Lines of Credit
    Arrangements

— The carrying amount of the
    unsecured line of credit arrangement approximates fair value
    because the borrowings are interest rate adjustable.

Senior Unsecured Notes

— The fair value of the
    senior unsecured notes payable was estimated based on publicly
    available trading prices.

Secured Debt

— The fair value of fixed rate
    secured debt is estimated by discounting the estimated future
    cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would
    be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the
    same remaining maturities. The carrying amount of variable rate
    secured debt approximates fair value because the borrowings are
    interest rate adjustable.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

— Interest rate
    swap agreements, if any, are recorded as assets or liabilities
    on the balance sheet at fair market value. Fair market value is
    estimated by utilizing pricing models that consider forward
    yield curves and discount rates.

U.S. GAAP provides authoritative guidance for measuring and
    disclosing fair value measurements of assets and liabilities.
    The guidance for financial assets and liabilities was previously
    adopted as the standard for those assets and liabilities as of
    January 1, 2008. Additional guidance for non-financial
    assets and liabilities is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008, and was adopted as the standard
    for those assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009. The
    impact of adoption was not significant. The guidance defines
    fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
    principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
    in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value
    hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value. The guidance describes three levels
    of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Interest

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

rate swap agreements are valued using models that assume a
    hypothetical transaction to sell the asset or transfer the
    liability in the principal market for the asset or liability
    based on market data derived from interest rates and yield
    curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
    prepayment timing, loss severities, credit risks and default
    rates.

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The market approach is utilized to measure fair value for our
    financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses
    prices and other relevant information generated by market
    transactions involving identical or comparable assets or
    liabilities.

Retirement
    Arrangements

Under the retirement plan and trust (the “401(k)
    Plan”), eligible employees may make contributions, and we
    may make matching contributions and a profit sharing
    contribution. Our contributions to the 401(k) Plan totaled
    $1,201,000, $1,013,000 and $441,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

We have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”), a non-qualified defined benefit pension
    plan, which provides one executive officer with supplemental
    deferred retirement benefits. The SERP provides an opportunity
    for participants to receive retirement benefits that cannot be
    paid under our tax-qualified plans because of the restrictions
    imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended. Benefits are based on compensation and length of
    service and the SERP is unfunded. No contributions by the
    Company are anticipated for the 2010 fiscal year. Benefit
    payments are expected to total $4,758,000 during the next five
    fiscal years and no benefit payments are expected to occur
    during the succeeding five fiscal years. We use a December 31
    measurement date for the SERP. The accrued liability on our
    balance sheet for the SERP was $3,287,000 at December 31,
    2009 ($3,109,000 at December 31, 2008).

Segment
    Reporting

We invest in senior housing and health care real estate. We
    evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our two
    business segments — investment properties and medical
    office buildings. Under the investment property segment, we
    invest in senior housing and health care real estate through
    acquisition and financing of primarily single tenant properties.
    Properties acquired are primarily leased under

triple-net

leases and we are not involved in the management of the
    property. Our primary investment property types include skilled
    nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, independent
    living/continuing care retirement communities and hospitals.
    Under the medical office building segment, our properties are
    typically leased under gross leases, modified gross leases or

triple-net

leases, to multiple tenants, and generally require a certain
    level of property management. The accounting policies of the
    segments are the same as those described in the summary of
    significant accounting policies in Note 1. There are no
    intersegment sales or transfers. We evaluate performance based
    upon net operating income of the combined properties in each
    segment.



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Non-segment revenue consists mainly of interest income on
    non-real estate investments and other income. Non-segment assets
    consist of corporate assets including cash, deferred loan
    expenses and corporate office equipment among others.
    Non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to
    individual segments in determining net operating income.

Net operating income
    (“NOI”) is used to evaluate the operating performance
    of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including
    tenant reimbursements, less property level operating expenses,
    which exclude depreciation and amortization, general and
    administrative expenses, impairments and interest expense. We
    believe NOI provides investors relevant and useful information
    because it measures the operating performance of our properties
    at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to
    make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the
    property level performance of our properties.

Retrospective
    Application of New Accounting Standards

We adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) topic for Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements (“Noncontrolling Interest
    Guidance”) and ASC topic for Accounting for Convertible
    Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion
    (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (“Convertible Debt
    Guidance”), effective January 1, 2009, each of which
    required retrospective application. Noncontrolling Interest
    Guidance changed the accounting and reporting for minority
    interests, which have been re-characterized as noncontrolling
    interests and classified as a component of equity. Convertible
    Debt Guidance provides guidance on accounting for convertible
    debt that may be settled in cash upon conversion. It requires
    bifurcation of the convertible debt instrument into a debt
    component and an equity component. The value of the debt
    component



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

is based upon the estimated fair value of a similar debt
    instrument without the conversion feature. The difference
    between the contractual principal on the debt and the value
    allocated to the debt is recorded as an equity component and
    represents the conversion feature of the instrument. The excess
    of the contractual principal amount of the debt over its
    estimated fair value is amortized to interest expense using the
    effective interest method over the period used to estimate the
    fair value. The following tables illustrate the retrospective
    restatement of our previously reported consolidated balance
    sheet amounts adjusted for certain balance sheet
    reclassifications to reflect the application of the new guidance

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the
    end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
    evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective as of the end of the period covered by this
    report.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
    or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009 based on the criteria established by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    in a report entitled Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework. Based on this assessment, using the criteria above,
    management concluded that the Company’s system of internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2009.

The independent registered public accounting firm of
    Ernst & Young LLP, as auditors of the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation
    report on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) occurred
    during the fourth quarter of the one-year period covered by this
    report that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited Health Care REIT, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Health Care REIT,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Management
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Health Care REIT, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Health Care REIT, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009 of Health Care REIT, Inc. and our report
    dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.
