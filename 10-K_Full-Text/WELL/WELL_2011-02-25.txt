ANNUAL REPORT



PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Health Care REIT, Inc. is a real estate investment trust
    (“REIT”) that has been at the forefront of senior
    housing and health care real estate since the company was
    founded in 1970. We are an S&P 500 company
    headquartered in Toledo, Ohio and our portfolio spans the full
    spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate,
    including senior housing communities, skilled nursing
    facilities, medical office buildings, inpatient and outpatient
    medical centers and life science facilities. Our capital
    programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development
    and property management services, make us a single-source
    solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing,
    repositioning and monetizing real estate assets. More
    information is available on the Internet at www.hcreit.com.

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and
    enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash
    dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase
    dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual
    increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To
    meet these objectives, we invest in the full spectrum of senior
    housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment
    portfolio by property type, operator/tenant and geographic
    location.

Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we
    believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations, meet
    debt service obligations (both principal and interest), make
    dividend distributions and complete construction projects in
    process. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to finance
    future investments. New investments are generally funded from
    temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from
    sales of real property. Our investments generate cash from rent
    and interest receipts and principal payments on loans
    receivable. Permanent capital for future investments, which
    replaces funds drawn under the unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, has historically been provided through a
    combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity
    securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.

References herein to “we,” “us,”
    “our” or the “Company” refer to Health Care
    REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless specifically noted
    otherwise.

Property
    Types

We invest in senior housing and health care real estate. We
    evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our two
    business segments — senior housing and care and
    medical facilities. For additional information regarding
    business segments, see Note 17 to our consolidated
    financial statements. The accounting policies of the segments
    are the same as those described in the summary of significant
    accounting policies (see Note 2 to our consolidated
    financial statements). The following is a summary of our various
    property types.

Senior
    Housing and Care

Our senior housing and care properties include skilled nursing
    facilities, assisted living facilities, independent
    living/continuing care retirement communities and combinations
    thereof. We invest in senior housing and care real estate
    primarily through acquisition and development. Excluding our
    operating partnerships (see Note 3 to our consolidated
    financial statements), properties are primarily leased under

triple-net

leases and we are not involved in property management. Our
    properties include stand-alone facilities that provide one level
    of service, combination facilities that provide multiple levels
    of service, and communities or campuses that provide a wide
    range of services.

Independent Living Facilities.

Independent
    living facilities are age-restricted, multifamily properties
    with central dining facilities that provide residents access to
    meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service,
    transportation and social and recreational activities.

Continuing Care Retirement
    Communities.

Continuing care retirement
    communities include a combination of detached homes, an
    independent living facility, an assisted living facility

and/or

a
    skilled nursing facility on one campus. These communities are
    appealing to residents because there is no need for relocating
    when health and medical needs change. Resident payment plans
    vary, but can include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental
    fees. Many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance
    fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health
    services.

Early Stage Senior Housing.

Early stage senior
    housing communities contain primarily for-sale single-family
    homes, townhomes, cluster homes, mobile homes

and/or

condominiums with no specialized services. These communities are
    typically restricted or targeted to adults at least
    55 years of age or older. Residents generally lead an
    independent lifestyle. Communities may include amenities such as
    a clubhouse, golf course and recreational spaces.

Assisted Living Facilities.

Assisted living
    facilities are state regulated rental properties that provide
    the same services as independent living facilities, but also
    provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who
    require assistance with activities of daily living, including
    management of medications, bathing, dressing, toileting,
    ambulating and eating.

Alzheimer’s/Dementia Care
    Facilities.

Certain assisted living facilities
    may include state licensed settings that specialize in caring
    for those afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease

and/or

other
    types of dementia.

Skilled Nursing Facilities.

Skilled nursing
    facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where
    the majority of individuals require

24-hour

nursing

and/or

medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for
    Medicaid

and/or

Medicare reimbursement.

Medical
    Facilities

Our medical facilities include medical office buildings,
    hospitals and life science buildings. Our medical office
    buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants and generally
    require a certain level of property management. Our hospital
    investments are typically structured similar to our senior
    housing and care investments. Our life science investments
    represent investments in an unconsolidated joint venture (see
    Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements).

Medical Office Buildings.

The medical office
    building portfolio consists of health care related buildings
    that include physician offices, ambulatory surgery centers,
    diagnostic facilities, outpatient services

and/or

labs.
    Our portfolio has a strong affiliation with health systems:
    approximately 80% of the buildings are either located on campus
    or affiliated with hospitals through a satellite location.



Hospitals.

Our hospitals generally include
    acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, and
    long-term acute care hospitals. Acute care hospitals provide a
    wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including, but
    not limited to, surgery, rehabilitation, therapy and clinical
    laboratories. Inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide
    inpatient services for patients with intensive rehabilitation
    needs. Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services
    for patients with complex medical conditions that require more
    intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than is
    available in most skilled nursing facilities.

Investments

We invest in senior housing and health care real estate
    primarily through acquisitions and developments. We diversify
    our investment portfolio by property type, operator/tenant and
    geographic location. In determining whether to invest in a
    property, we focus on the following: (1) the experience of
    the obligor’s management team; (2) the historical and
    projected financial and operational performance of the property;
    (3) the credit of the obligor; (4) the security for
    the lease or loan; (5) the real estate attributes of the
    building and its location; and (6) the capital committed to
    the property by the obligor. We conduct market research and
    analysis for all potential investments. In addition, we review
    the value of all properties, the interest rates and covenant
    requirements of any facility-level debt to be assumed by us at
    the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of
    repayment of any of the obligor’s existing debt that is not
    to be assumed by us at the time of the acquisition.

We monitor our investments through a variety of methods
    determined by the type of property. Our asset management process
    for senior housing and care properties generally includes review
    of monthly financial statements and other operating data for
    each property, periodic review of obligor creditworthiness,
    periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance
    relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and
    other collateral. Our internal property management division
    actively manages and monitors the medical office building
    portfolio with a comprehensive process including tenant
    relations, tenant lease expirations, the mix of health service
    providers, hospital/health system relationships, property
    performance, capital improvement needs and market conditions
    among other things. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel
    use a proprietary database to collect and analyze
    property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive
    research to ascertain industry trends and risks.

Through asset management and research, we evaluate the operating
    environment in each property’s market to determine whether
    payment risk is likely to increase. When we identify
    unacceptable levels of payment risk, we seek to mitigate,
    eliminate or transfer the risk. We categorize the risk as
    obligor, property or market risk. For obligor risk, we typically
    find a substitute operator/tenant to run the property. For
    property risk, we usually work with the operator/tenant to
    institute property-level management changes to address the risk.
    Finally, for market risk, we often encourage an obligor to
    change its capital structure, including refinancing the property
    or raising additional equity. Through these asset management and
    research efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early
    stage to address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the
    collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new
    investments will be available in the future with spreads over
    our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to
    our stockholders.

Investment
    Types

Real Property.

Our hospitals and senior
    housing and care properties are primarily comprised of land,
    building, improvements and related rights. Excluding properties
    in our senior housing operating partnerships (see Note 3 to
    our consolidated financial statements), these properties are
    generally leased to operators under long-term operating leases.
    The leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to
    15 years and contain one or more five to

15-year

renewal options. Certain of our leases also contain purchase
    options. Most of our rents are received under

triple-net

leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional
    charges incurred in the operation of the leased property. The
    tenants are required to repair, rebuild and maintain the leased
    properties. Substantially all of these operating leases are
    designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent
    structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial
    lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental
    income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is
    generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments
    due for the period.



At December 31, 2010, approximately 91% of our hospitals
    and senior housing and care properties were subject to master
    leases. A master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one
    tenant entity under a single lease agreement. From time to time,
    we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the
    tenant under the master lease. The tenant is required to make
    one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties
    that are subject to the master lease. Typically, the master
    lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties
    or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased
    properties at the same time. This bundling feature benefits us
    because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the
    better performing properties and terminate the leasing
    arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties.
    This spreads our risk among the entire group of properties
    within the master lease. The bundling feature should provide a
    similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy.
    Subject to certain restrictions, a debtor in bankruptcy has the
    right to assume or reject each of its leases. It is our intent
    that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or
    reject the master lease as a whole, rather than deciding on a
    property by property basis.

Our medical office building portfolio is primarily self-managed
    and consists principally of multi-tenant properties leased to
    health care providers. Our leases have favorable lease terms
    that typically include fixed increasers and some form of
    operating expense reimbursement by the tenant. As of
    December 31, 2010, 88% of our portfolio included leases
    with full pass through, 10% with a partial expense reimbursement
    (modified gross) and 2% with no expense reimbursement (gross).
    Our medical office building leases are non-cancellable operating
    leases that have a weighted average remaining term of
    8.5 years at December 31, 2010 and are normally credit
    enhanced by guaranties

and/or

letters of credit.

Construction.

We currently provide for the
    construction of properties for tenants generally as part of
    long-term operating leases. We capitalize certain interest costs
    associated with funds used to pay for the construction of
    properties owned by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the
    amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of
    interest that approximates our cost of financing. Our interest
    expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. We also typically
    charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction
    which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the
    resulting lease. The construction period commences upon funding
    and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the
    applicable property or the end of a specified period. During the
    construction period, we advance funds to the tenants in
    accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require,
    among other things, periodic site visits by a Company
    representative. During the construction period, we generally
    require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment
    and performance bonds

and/or

completion guaranties. At December 31, 2010, we had
    outstanding construction investments of $356,793,000 and were
    committed to providing additional funds of approximately
    $268,055,000 to complete construction for investment properties.

Real Estate Loans.

Our real estate loans are
    typically structured to provide us with interest income,
    principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally
    secured by a first, second or third mortgage lien, leasehold
    mortgage, corporate guaranties

and/or

personal guaranties. At December 31, 2010, we had
    outstanding real estate loans of $436,580,000. The interest
    yield averaged approximately 9.1% per annum on our outstanding
    real estate loan balances. Our yield on real estate loans
    depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest
    rate, average principal amount outstanding during the term of
    the loan and any interest rate adjustments. The real estate
    loans outstanding at December 31, 2010 are generally
    subject to three to

20-year

terms with principal amortization schedules

and/or

balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the
    end of the term. Typically, real estate loans are
    cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate
    loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor
    and its affiliates.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we
    control, through voting rights or other means. All material
    intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
    consolidation.



At inception of the joint venture transactions, we identify
    entities for which control is achieved through means other than
    voting rights (“variable interest entities” or
    “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the
    primary beneficiary of its operations. A variable interest
    entity is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the
    equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling
    financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk
    is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without
    additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate
    investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary
    beneficiary. ASC 810 requires enterprises to perform a
    qualitative approach to determining whether or not a VIE will
    need to be consolidated on a continuous basis. This evaluation
    is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence
    the activities of a variable interest entity that most
    significantly impact that entity’s economic performance.

For investments in joint ventures, we evaluate the type of
    rights held by the limited partner(s), which may preclude
    consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner
    would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership. The
    assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on
    the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the
    sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the
    sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there
    is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights
    of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner
    increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership
    interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the
    number of outstanding limited partnership interests. We
    similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited
    liability companies.

Equity
    Investments

Equity investments at December 31, 2010 and 2009 include an
    investment in a public company that has a readily determinable
    fair market value. We classify this equity investment as

available-for-sale

and, accordingly, record this investment at its fair market
    value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income, a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. Equity investments at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 also include an investment in a
    private company. We do not have the ability to exercise
    influence over the company, so the investment is accounted for
    under the cost method. Under the cost method of accounting,
    investments in private companies are carried at cost and are
    adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value, return of capital and additional
    investments. These equity investments represent a minimal
    ownership interest in these companies. Additionally, equity
    investments at December 31, 2010 include investments in
    unconsolidated joint ventures.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint
    Ventures.

Investments in less than majority owned
    entities where our interests represent a general partnership
    interest but substantive participating rights or substantive
    kick-out rights have been granted to the limited partners or
    when our interests do not represent the general partnership
    interest and we do not control the major operating and financial
    policies of the entity are reported under the equity method of
    accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of
    the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our
    consolidated results of operations. The initial carrying value
    of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the
    amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the
    estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of
    interests in the joint venture. We evaluate our equity method
    investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the
    estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its
    carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated
    fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is

other-than-temporary,

an impairment is recorded.

Borrowing
    Policies

We utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments.
    Our debt and equity levels are determined by management to
    maintain a conservative credit profile. Generally, we intend to
    issue unsecured, fixed rate public debt with long-term
    maturities to approximate the maturities on our leases and
    loans. For short-term purposes, we may borrow on our unsecured
    line of credit arrangement. We replace these borrowings with
    long-term capital such as senior unsecured notes, common stock
    or preferred stock. When terms are deemed favorable, we may
    invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness.
    In addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged
    properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties
    acquired on a leveraged basis. In our agreements with our
    lenders, we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured
    and unsecured indebtedness.



Competition

We compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate
    partnerships, private equity and hedge fund investors, banks,
    insurance companies, finance/investment companies,
    government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond
    funds, health care operators, developers and other investors in
    the acquisition, development, leasing and financing of health
    care and senior housing properties. Some of our competitors are
    larger with greater resources and lower costs of capital than
    us. Increased competition inhibits our ability to identify and
    successfully complete investments. We compete for investments
    based on a number of factors including rates, financings
    offered, underwriting criteria and reputation. Our ability to
    successfully compete is also impacted by economic and population
    trends, availability of acceptable investment opportunities, our
    ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms, availability
    and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs and new
    and existing laws and regulations.

The operators/tenants of our properties compete on a local and
    regional basis with operators/tenants of properties that provide
    comparable services. Operators/tenants compete for patients and
    residents based on a number of factors including quality of
    care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, services
    offered, family preferences, physicians, staff and price. We
    also face competition from other health care facilities for
    tenants, such as physicians and other health care providers that
    provide comparable facilities and services.

Certain
    Government Regulations

Health
    Law Matters — Generally

Typically, operators of senior housing facilities do not receive
    significant funding from government programs and are largely
    subject to state laws, as opposed to federal laws. Operators of
    skilled nursing facilities and hospitals do receive significant
    funding from government programs, and these facilities are
    subject to the federal and state laws that regulate the type and
    quality of the medical

and/or

nursing care provided, ancillary services (

e.g.

,
    respiratory, occupational, physical and infusion therapies),
    qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing
    staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment,
    reimbursement and rate setting and operating



policies. In addition, as described below, operators of these
    facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations
    pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including, but not
    limited to, the Federal Anti-kickback Statute, the Federal Stark
    Law, and the Federal False Claims Act, as well as comparable
    state law counterparts. Hospitals, physician group practice
    clinics, and other health care providers that operate in our
    portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state, and local
    licensure, registration, certification, and inspection laws,
    regulations, and industry standards. Our tenants’ failure
    to comply with any of these, and other, laws could result in
    loss of accreditation; denial of reimbursement; imposition of
    fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal
    and state health care programs; loss of license; or closure of
    the facility.

Licensing
    and Certification

The primary regulations that affect senior housing facilities
    with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws.
    In granting and renewing these licenses, the state regulatory
    agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property’s
    physical plant and operations including, but not limited to,
    admission and discharge standards, staffing, and training. A
    decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a
    property owner’s record with respect to patient and
    consumer rights, medication guidelines, and rules. Certain of
    the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may
    require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee, a
    portion of which may be refundable. These entrance fee
    communities are subject to significant state regulatory
    oversight, including, for example, oversight of each
    facility’s financial condition; establishment and
    monitoring of reserve requirements, and other financial
    restrictions; the right of residents to cancel their contracts
    within a specified period of time; lien rights in favor of
    residents; restrictions on change of ownership; and similar
    matters. Such oversight, and the rights of residents within
    these entrance fee communities, may have an effect on the
    revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities, and,
    therefore, may adversely affect us.

Certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of
    licensure and certificate of need (“CON”) laws and
    regulations. Where applicable, CON laws generally require, among
    other requirements, that a facility demonstrate the need for
    (1) constructing a new facility, (2) adding beds or
    expanding an existing facility, (3) investing in major
    capital equipment or adding new services, (4) changing the
    ownership or control of an existing licensed facility, or
    (5) terminating services that have been previously approved
    through the CON process. Certain state CON laws and regulations
    may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or
    expand an existing facility’s size or services. In
    addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to
    transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a
    new operator. If we have to replace a property operator who is
    excluded from participating in a federal or state health care
    program (as discussed below), our ability to replace the
    operator may be affected by a particular state’s CON laws,
    regulations, and applicable guidance governing changes in
    provider control.

With respect to licensure, generally our skilled nursing
    facilities and acute care facilities are required to be licensed
    and certified for participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other
    federal health care programs. This generally requires license
    renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or bi-annual basis.
    The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required
    license or regulatory approval, as well as the failure of our
    operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a
    compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue
    operations at a property. In addition, if a property is found to
    be out of compliance with the Medicare, Medicaid, or other
    health care program conditions of participation in, the property
    operator may be excluded from participating in those government
    health care programs. Any such occurrence may impair an
    operators’ ability to meet their financial obligations to
    us. If we have to replace an excluded property operator, our
    ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and
    state laws, regulations, and applicable guidance governing
    changes in provider control. This may result in payment delays,
    an inability to find a replacement operator, a significant
    working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other
    difficulties.

Reimbursement

Senior Housing Facilities.

Approximately 37%
    of our rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010
    were attributable to senior housing facilities. The majority of
    the revenues received by the operators of our senior housing
    facilities are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue
    source is primarily Medicaid under certain waiver programs. As a
    part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”)
    of 1981, Congress established a waiver program enabling some
    states to offer Medicaid reimbursement to assisted living
    providers as an alternative



to institutional long-term care services. The provisions of OBRA
    and the subsequent OBRA Acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to
    seek a waiver from typical Medicaid requirements to develop
    cost-effective alternatives to long-term care, including
    Medicaid payments for assisted living and home health. As of
    December 31, 2010, four of our 41 senior housing operators
    received Medicaid reimbursement pursuant to Medicaid waiver
    programs. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2010,
    approximately 9% of the revenues at our senior housing
    facilities were from Medicaid reimbursement. There can be no
    guarantee that a state Medicaid program operating pursuant to a
    waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status.

Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and
    are determined by local market conditions and operating costs.
    Generally, facilities receive a higher payment per day for a
    private pay resident than for a Medicaid beneficiary who
    requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid
    reimbursement varies from state to state. Thus, the revenues
    generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be
    adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level, changes in
    Medicaid eligibility, and reimbursement levels. In addition, a
    state could lose its Medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted
    to utilize Medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living
    services. Changes in revenues could in turn have a material
    adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its
    obligations to us.

Skilled Nursing Facilities and
    Hospitals.

Skilled nursing facilities and
    hospitals typically receive most of their revenues from the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the balance representing
    reimbursement payments from private payors, including private
    insurers. Consequently, changes in federal or state
    reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an
    operator’s ability to cover its expenses, including our
    rent or debt service. Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals
    are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews, and other
    audits by federal and state authorities. A review or audit of a
    property operator’s claims could result in recoupments,
    denials, or delay of payments in the future, which could have a
    material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet
    its financial obligations to us. Due to the significant
    judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting,
    no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves
    maintained by our property operators to cover potential
    adjustments to reimbursements, or to cover settlements made to
    payors. In fact, in December 2010, the Department of Health and
    Human Services Office of Inspector General (“OIG”)
    released a report focusing on skilled nursing facilities’
    billing practices for Medicare Part A payments, and found
    that between

2006-2008

skilled nursing facilities increasingly billed for higher paying
    Resource Utilization Groups (“RUGs”), the payment
    classification mechanism for the Medicare program, even though
    beneficiary characteristics remained largely unchanged. In
    particular, from 2006 to 2008, OIG found that the percentage of
    RUGs for ultra high therapy increased from 17% to 28%, despite
    the fact that beneficiaries’ ages and diagnoses at
    admission were largely unchanged during that time period. As a
    result of the recent attention on skilled nursing billing
    practices and ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by
    government health care programs, government health care programs
    may limit or reduce payments to skilled nursing facilities and
    hospitals, and, as a result, an operator’s ability to meet
    its financial obligations to us may be significantly impaired.

Medicare Reimbursement and Skilled Nursing
    Facilities.

For the twelve months ended
    September 30, 2010, approximately 30% of the revenues at
    our skilled nursing facilities (which comprised 27% of our
    rental revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2010) were paid by Medicare. Skilled nursing facilities are
    reimbursed under the Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility
    Prospective Payment System (“SNF PPS”). There is a
    risk that some skilled nursing facilities’ costs will
    exceed the fixed payments under the SNF PPS, and there is also a
    risk that payments under the SNF PPS may be set below the costs
    to provide certain items and services, which could result in
    immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities,
    and could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection. Skilled
    nursing facilities have faced these types of difficulties since
    the implementation of the SNF PPS.

Skilled nursing facilities received a net 1.1% Medicare payment
    rate decrease for federal fiscal year 2010. This 1.1% net
    decrease is the result of a 3.3% decrease in payments due to
    recalibration of the case-mix indexes combined with a 2.2%
    increase in payments through “market basket” changes
    for fiscal year 2010. The Centers for Medicare &
    Medicaid Services (“CMS”), an agency of the
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
    (“HHS”), has announced its intention to make a
    positive payment update for skilled nursing facilities for
    fiscal year 2011 — a net 1.7% increase resulting from
    a 2.3% market basket update less a 0.6% forecasting error
    adjustment. Section 5008 of the Deficit Reduction Act of
    2005 directs the Secretary of HHS to conduct a demonstration
    program, for a three year period, beginning January 1,
    2008, assessing the costs and outcomes of patients discharged
    from hospitals in a variety of post-acute care settings,
    including skilled nursing facilities. The outcome of that



demonstration program could lead to changes in Medicare coverage
    and reimbursement for post-acute care. Because the results of
    the demonstration have not yet been finalized, we cannot predict
    the potential financial implications those results, or any other
    proposed changes to the Medicare program, may have on our
    operators or tenants.

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated caps on Medicare
    reimbursement for certain therapy services. However, Congress
    imposed various moratoriums on the implementation of those caps.
    For 2011, the annual payment cap of $1,870 per patient applies
    to occupational therapy and a separate $1,870 cap applies to
    speech and physical therapy. Congress has permitted patients
    exceeding the cap to obtain additional Medicare coverage through
    a waiver program if the therapy is deemed medically necessary.
    The waiver program was historically extended, most recently, on
    December 15, 2010, by the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders
    Act (HR 4994), which extended the waiver program through
    December 31, 2011. Prior to the recent legislation, the
    program was scheduled to expire December 31, 2010. If the
    exception expires, patients will need to use private funds to
    pay for the cost of therapy above the caps. If patients are
    unable to satisfy their

out-of-pocket

cost responsibility to reimburse an operator for services
    rendered, the operator’s ability to meet its financial
    obligations to us could be adversely impacted.

Medicare Reimbursement and Hospitals.

For the
    twelve months ended September 30, 2010, approximately 56%
    of the revenues at our hospitals (which comprised 8% of our
    rental revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2010) were from Medicare reimbursements. Hospitals,
    generally, are reimbursed by Medicare under the Hospital
    Inpatient Prospective Payment System (“PPS”), the
    Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System
    (“OPPS”), the Long Term Care Hospital Prospective
    Payment System (“LTCH PPS”), or the Inpatient
    Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System (“IRF
    PPS”). Acute care hospitals provide a wide range of
    inpatient and outpatient services including, but not limited to,
    surgery, rehabilitation, therapy, and clinical laboratory
    services. Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient
    services for patients with medical conditions that are often
    complex and that require more intensive care, monitoring or
    emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing
    facilities. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide
    intensive rehabilitation services in an inpatient setting for
    patients requiring at least three hours of rehabilitation
    services a day.

With respect to Medicare’s PPS for regular hospitals,
    reimbursement for inpatient services is made on the basis of a
    fixed, prospective rate, based on the principal diagnosis of the
    patient. Hospitals may be at risk to the extent that their costs
    in treating a specific case exceed the fixed payment amount. The
    diagnosis related group (“DRG”) reimbursement system
    was updated in 2008 to expand the number of DRGs from 538 to 745
    in order to better distinguish more severe conditions. One
    additional DRG was added in 2009, for a new total of 746. In
    some cases, a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier
    payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a threshold.

Medicaid Reimbursement.

Medicaid is a major
    payor source for residents in our skilled nursing facilities and
    hospitals. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2010,
    approximately 51% of the revenues of our skilled nursing
    facilities and 4% of the revenues of our hospitals were
    attributable to Medicaid reimbursement payments. The federal and
    state governments share responsibility for financing Medicaid.
    The federal matching rate, known as the Federal Medical
    Assistance Percentage (“FMAP”), varies by state based
    on relative per capita income, but is at least 50% in all
    states. On average, Medicaid is the largest component of total
    state spending, representing approximately 21% of total state
    spending. The percentage of Medicaid dollars used for long-term
    care varies from state to state, due in part to different ratios
    of elderly population and eligibility requirements. Within
    certain federal guidelines, states have a fairly wide range of
    discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement
    methodology. Many states reimburse long-term care facilities
    using fixed daily rates, which are applied prospectively based
    on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing
    patient care. Reasonable costs typically include allowances for
    staffing, administrative and general expenses, property, and
    equipment (

e.g.

, real estate taxes, depreciation and fair
    rental).

In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of
    providing skilled nursing services. Certain states are
    attempting to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid expenditures
    by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits. As of
    the beginning of state fiscal year 2011, states in which we have
    skilled nursing property investments held rates flat on average
    for the year. Our skilled nursing portfolio’s average
    Medicaid rate will likely vary throughout the year as states
    continue to make interim changes to their budgets and Medicaid
    funding. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement rates may decline
    if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund
    budgeted expenditures. President Obama’s proposed fiscal
    year budget for 2012, released on February 14, 2011, has
    the



potential to further impact Medicaid reimbursement rates. The
    President’s budget includes a proposal to phase down the
    Medicaid provider tax, a tax paid by health care providers to
    help fund state Medicaid programs, beginning with a reduction of
    4.5% in fiscal year 2015. If the President’s proposal is
    implemented, the various state Medicaid programs will receive
    less funds, which could adversely affect our operators and
    tenants.

The Medicare Part D drug benefit became effective
    January 1, 2006. Since that date, low-income Medicare
    beneficiaries (eligible for both Medicare and full Medicaid
    benefits), including those nursing home residents who are dually
    eligible for both programs, may enroll and receive outpatient
    prescription drugs under Medicare, not Medicaid. Medicare
    Part D has resulted in increased administrative
    responsibilities for nursing home operators because enrollment
    in Medicare Part D is voluntary and residents must choose
    between multiple prescription drug plans. Operators may also
    experience increased expenses to the extent that a particular
    drug prescribed to a patient is not listed on the Medicare
    Part D drug plan formulary for the plan in which the
    patient is enrolled.

The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care
    facilities continue to evolve. Federal and state authorities
    have considered and may seek to implement new or modified
    reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health
    care property operations. The impact of any such changes, if
    implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our
    skilled nursing and hospital property operations. No assurance
    can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be
    maintained. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that payments
    under a government health care program are currently, or will be
    in the future, sufficient to fully reimburse the property
    operators for their operating and capital expenses. As a result,
    an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to
    us could be adversely impacted.

Finally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
    (“PPACA”) and the Health Care and Education
    Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the PPACA
    (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”) (further
    discussed below).may have a significant impact on Medicare,
    Medicaid, other federal health care programs, and private
    insurers, which impact the reimbursement amounts received by
    skilled nursing facilities and other health care providers. The
    Health Reform Laws could have a substantial and material adverse
    effect on all parties directly or indirectly involved in the
    health care system.

Other
    Related Laws

Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and senior housing
    facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to
    federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and applicable
    guidance that govern the operations and financial and other
    arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers.
    Certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of
    any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral
    of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by
    government health care programs. Other laws require providers to
    furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the
    government valid and accurate statements for each service.
    Still, other laws require providers to comply with a variety of
    safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition
    of the licensed property and the quality of care provided.
    Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations, and other
    applicable guidance may include, but are not limited to,
    criminal

and/or

civil
    penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of
    government payments, and exclusion from any government health
    care program. In certain circumstances, violation of these rules
    (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with
    respect to one property may subject other facilities under
    common control or ownership to sanctions, including exclusion
    from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as
    well as other government health care programs. In the ordinary
    course of its business, a property operator is regularly
    subjected to inquiries, investigations, and audits by the
    federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and
    regulations.

All health care providers, including, but not limited to skilled
    nursing facilities and hospitals (and senior housing facilities
    that receives Medicaid payments) are also subject to the Federal
    Anti-kickback Statute, which generally prohibits persons from
    offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to
    induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of
    a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal
    health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Skilled
    nursing facilities and hospitals are also subject to the Federal
    Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as
    the Stark Law. The Stark Law generally prohibits the submission
    of claims to Medicare for payment if the claim results from a
    physician referral for certain designated services and the
    physician has a financial relationship with the health service
    provider that does not



qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship
    under the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions on physician
    self-referrals and submission of claims apply to state Medicaid
    programs. Further, health care providers, including, but not
    limited to, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and senior
    housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments), are subject
    to substantial financial penalties under the Civil Monetary
    Penalties Act and the Federal False Claims Act and, in
    particular, actions under the Federal False Claims Act’s
    “whistleblower” provisions. Private enforcement of
    health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments
    to the Federal False Claims Act that encourage private
    individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These
    whistleblower suits brought by private individuals, known as qui
    tam actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present
    and former patients, nurses and other employees. Such
    whistleblower actions have been brought against nursing
    facilities on the basis of the alleged failure of the nursing
    facility to meet applicable regulations relating to its
    operations. Significantly, if a claim is successfully
    adjudicated, the Federal False Claims Act provides for treble
    damages up to $11,000 per claim.

Prosecutions, investigations, or whistleblower actions could
    have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s
    liquidity, financial condition, and operations, which could
    adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its
    financial obligations to us. Finally, various state false claim
    act and anti-kickback laws may also apply to each property
    operator. Violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result
    in criminal

and/or

civil
    penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the
    ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us.

Other legislative developments over the past several years,
    including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), have greatly expanded the
    definition of health care fraud and related offenses and
    broadened its scope to include private health care plans in
    addition to government payors. Congress also has greatly
    increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau
    of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General of the
    Department of Health and Human Services to audit, investigate
    and prosecute suspected health care fraud. Moreover, a
    significant portion of the billions in health care fraud
    recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to
    government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation
    and prosecution efforts.

Additionally, other HIPAA provisions and regulations provide for
    communication of health information through standard electronic
    transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health
    information. In order to comply with the regulations, health
    care providers often must undertake significant operational and
    technical implementation efforts. Operators also may face
    significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the
    privacy and security of medical records and other personal
    health information about individuals. The Health Information
    Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”)
    Act, passed in February 2009, strengthened the HHS
    Secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for
    HIPAA violations occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH
    directs the HHS Secretary to provide for periodic audits to
    ensure covered entities and their business associates (as that
    term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HITECH
    requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation
    will result in an enforcement action. CMS issued an interim
    Final Rule which conformed HIPAA enforcement regulations to the
    HITECH Act, increasing the maximum penalty for multiple
    violations of a single requirement or prohibition to
    $1.5 million. Higher penalties may accrue for violations of
    multiple requirements or prohibitions. HIPAA violations are also
    potentially subject to criminal penalties.

In November 2002, CMS began an ongoing national Nursing Home
    Quality Initiative (NHQI). Under this initiative, historical
    survey information, the NHQI Pilot Evaluation Report and the
    NHQI Overview is made available to the public on-line. The NHQI
    website provides consumer and provider information regarding the
    quality of care in nursing homes. The data allows consumers,
    providers, states, and researchers to compare quality
    information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for
    their residents’ physical and clinical needs. The posted
    nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data
    that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at
    specified intervals during their stay. If the operators of
    nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings
    that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors,
    they may lose market share to other facilities, reducing their
    revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental
    payments.

Finally, government investigations and enforcement actions
    brought against the health care industry have increased
    dramatically over the past several years and are expected to
    continue. Some of these enforcement actions represent novel
    legal theories and expansions in the application of the Federal
    False Claims Act. The costs for an operator of a health care
    property associated with both defending such enforcement actions
    and the undertakings in



settling these actions can be substantial and could have a
    material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet
    its obligations to us.

Taxation

Federal
    Income Tax Considerations

The following summary of the taxation of the Company and the
    material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and
    equity securities is for general information only and is not tax
    advice. This summary does not address all aspects of taxation
    that may be relevant to certain types of holders of stock or
    securities (including, but not limited to, insurance companies,
    tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
    persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging,
    integrated conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a
    straddle, traders in securities that use a

mark-to-market

method of accounting for their securities, investors in
    pass-through entities and foreign corporations and persons who

    addition, this summary does not discuss any state or local
    income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax
    consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal
    income tax law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal
    income tax law, including changes in law or differing
    interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have
    a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax
    consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our
    securities as set forth in this summary. Before you purchase our
    securities, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding

General

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (a
    “REIT”) commencing with our first taxable year. We
    intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as
    a REIT, but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain
    qualified as a REIT for subsequent years. Qualification and
    taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety of
    qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with
    respect to income, assets, distribution level and diversity of
    share ownership as discussed below under
    “— Qualification as a REIT.” There can be no
    assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate
    in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified.

In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general, we will
    not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT
    taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to
    stockholders. We may, however, be subject to tax at normal
    corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not
    distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net
    long-term capital gain, stockholders are required to include
    their proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital
    gain in income, but they will receive a refundable credit for
    their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain.

Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to federal income
    and excise tax as follows:

•

To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital
    gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our
    “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject
    to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax
    rates;

•

We may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax”
    (the “AMT”) on certain tax preference items to the
    extent that the AMT exceeds our regular tax;

•

If we have net income from the sale or other disposition of
    “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale
    to customers in the ordinary course of business or other
    non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, such income
    will be taxed at the highest corporate rate;

•

Any net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in
    general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily
    for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other
    than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of
    property due to an involuntary conversion) will be subject to a
    100% tax;



•

If we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95% gross income tests
    (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our qualification
    as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be
    subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross
    income attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross
    income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes
    of the 75% gross income test (discussed below) or (ii) 95%
    of our gross income (90% of our gross income for taxable years
    beginning on or before October 22, 2004) over the
    amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% gross
    income test (discussed below) multiplied by (2) a fraction
    intended to reflect our profitability;

•

If we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of
    (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year,
    (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year
    (other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on)
    and (3) any undistributed taxable income from preceding
    periods, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of
    such required distribution over amounts actually
    distributed; and

•

We will be subject to a 100% tax on the amount of any rents from
    real property, deductions or excess interest paid to us by any
    of our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” that would be
    reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax
    principles in order to more clearly reflect income of the
    taxable REIT subsidiary. See “— Qualification as
    a REIT — Investments in Taxable REIT
    Subsidiaries.”

If we acquire any assets from a corporation, which is or has
    been a “C” corporation, in a carryover basis
    transaction, we could be liable for specified liabilities that
    are inherited from the “C” corporation. A
    “C” corporation is generally defined as a corporation
    that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax.
    If we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the
    ten-year period beginning on the date on which the assets were
    acquired by us, then, to the extent of the assets’
    “built-in gain” (i.e., the excess of the fair market
    value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset, in
    each case determined as of the beginning of the ten-year
    period), we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest
    regular corporate rate applicable. The results described in this
    paragraph with respect to the recognition of built-in gain
    assume that the built-in gain assets, at the time the built-in
    gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction (either
    where a “C” corporation elected REIT status or a REIT
    acquired the assets from a “C” corporation), were not
    treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized.
    Effective December 30, 2010, we acquired 19 assets that are
    subject to built-in gains tax until December 2020. See
    Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for
    additional information regarding the built-in gains tax.

Qualification
    as a REIT

A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or association:

(1)

which is managed by one or more trustees or directors;

(2)

the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable
    shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;

(3)

which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the
    federal income tax law relating to REITs;

(4)

which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance
    company;

(5)

the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons
    in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first taxable
    year;

(6)

not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is
    owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding its
    first taxable year, directly or indirectly, by or for five or
    fewer individuals (which includes certain entities) (the
    “Five or Fewer Requirement”); and

(7)

which meets certain income and asset tests described below.

Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the
    entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at
    least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or
    during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than
    12 months. For purposes of conditions (5) and (6),
    pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated
    as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception
    in the case of condition (6).



Based on publicly available information, we believe we have
    satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in
    (5) and (6) above. In addition, Article VI of our
    Amended and Restated By-Laws provides for restrictions regarding
    ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are
    intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share
    ownership requirements described in (5) and (6) above.
    These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all
    cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements
    described in (5) and (6) above.

We have complied with, and will continue to comply with,
    regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our
    stockholders requesting information regarding the actual
    ownership of our stock. If, despite sending the annual letters,
    we do not know, or after exercising reasonable diligence would
    not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer
    Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer
    Requirement. If we fail to comply with these regulatory rules,
    we will be subject to a monetary penalty. If our failure to
    comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement, the
    penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply
    were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty
    would be imposed.

We may own a number of properties through wholly owned
    subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified
    REIT subsidiary” if 100% of its stock is owned by a REIT,
    and the REIT does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable
    REIT subsidiary. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” will
    not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets,
    liabilities and items of income, deductions and credits of a
    “qualified REIT subsidiary” will be treated as assets,
    liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT. A
    “qualified REIT subsidiary” is not subject to federal
    income tax, and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified
    REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against
    ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more
    than 10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or
    more than 5% of the value of our total assets, as described
    below under “— Asset Tests.”

If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability company or a
    trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will
    be deemed to own a proportionate share of the
    partnership’s, limited liability company’s or
    trust’s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving
    our share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited
    liability company or trust, and the gross income will retain the
    same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the
    partnership, limited liability company or trust. These
    “look-through” rules apply for purposes of the income
    tests and assets tests described below.

Income Tests.

There are two separate
    percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we
    must satisfy for each taxable year.

•

At least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
    directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from
    “rents from real property,” other income from
    investments relating to real property or mortgages on real
    property or certain income from qualified temporary investments.

•

At least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
    directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the
    sources qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from
    dividends (including dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries)
    and interest.

For taxable years beginning on or before October 22, 2004,
    (1) payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap
    agreement, option, futures contract, forward rate agreement or
    any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce
    interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred
    and (2) gain from the sale or other disposition of any such
    investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95% gross
    income test. As to transactions entered into in taxable years
    beginning after October 22, 2004, any of our income from a
    “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is
    entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or
    indirectly, to manage the risk of interest rate movements, price
    changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or
    obligations incurred or to be incurred by us, or such other
    risks that are prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is
    excluded from the 95% gross income test.

For transactions entered into after July 30, 2008, any of
    our income from a “clearly identified” hedging
    transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of
    business, directly or indirectly, to manage the risk of interest
    rate movements, price changes or currency fluctuations with
    respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred
    by us is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.



For transactions entered into after July 30, 2008, any of
    our income from a “clearly identified” hedging
    transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of
    currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain
    that is included in gross income in the 95% and 75% gross income
    tests is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.

In general, a hedging transaction is “clearly
    identified” if (1) the transaction is identified as a
    hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is
    entered into and (2) the items or risks being hedged are
    identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the
    hedging transaction. An identification is not substantially
    contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after
    entering into the hedging transaction.

As to gains and items of income recognized after July 30,
    2008, “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable
    year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95%
    gross income test and “real estate foreign exchange
    gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income
    for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Real estate foreign
    exchange gain is foreign currency gain (as defined in Internal
    Revenue Code section 988(b)(1)) which is attributable to:
    (i) any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of
    the 75% gross income test; (ii) the acquisition or
    ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property
    or interests in real property; or (iii) becoming or being
    the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real
    property or on interests in real property. Real estate foreign
    exchange gain also includes Internal Revenue Code
    section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit
    (a “QBU”) of a REIT if the QBU itself meets the 75%
    income test for the taxable year and the 75% asset test at the
    close of each quarter that the REIT has directly or indirectly
    held the QBU. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes
    any other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary
    of the Treasury. Passive foreign exchange gain includes all real
    estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is
    attributable to: (i) any qualifying item of income or gain
    for purposes of the 95% gross income test; (ii) the
    acquisition or ownership of obligations; (iii) becoming or
    being the obligor under obligations; and (iv) any other
    foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the
    Treasury.

Generally, other than income from “clearly identified”
    hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of
    business, any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing,
    or engaging in substantial and regular trading, in securities
    will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the
    95% or 75% gross income tests.

Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real
    property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests
    for a REIT only if several conditions are met:

•

The amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the
    income or profits of any person, although rents generally will
    not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed
    percentage or percentages of receipts or sales.

•

Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real
    property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT,
    also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant,
    unless the tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain
    other requirements are met with respect to the real property
    being rented.

•

If rent attributable to personal property leased in connection
    with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total
    rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent
    attributable to such personal property will not qualify as
    “rents from real property.”

•

For rents to qualify as rents from real property, we generally
    must not furnish or render services to tenants, other than
    through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an “independent
    contractor” from whom we derive no income, except that we
    may directly provide services that are “usually or
    customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the
    property is located in connection with the rental of real
    property for occupancy only, or are not otherwise considered
    “rendered to the occupant for his convenience.”

•

For taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008, the REIT
    may lease “qualified health care properties” on an
    arm’s-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the
    property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person
    who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who
    is, or is related to a person who is, actively engaged in the
    trade or business of operating health care facilities for any
    person unrelated to us or our taxable REIT subsidiary, an
    “eligible independent contractor.” Generally, the rent
    that the REIT receives



from the taxable REIT subsidiary will be treated as “rents
    from real property.” A “qualified health care
    property” includes any real property and any personal
    property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a
    hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate
    care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other
    licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary
    services to patients and which is operated by a provider of such
    services which is eligible for participation in the Medicare
    program with respect to such facility.

For taxable years beginning after August 5, 1997, a REIT
    has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of
    impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts
    received with respect to that property as rent from real
    property. The amount received or accrued by the REIT during the
    taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a
    property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by
    the REIT directly or indirectly from the property. The amount
    received for any service or management operation for this
    purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150% of the direct
    cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or
    providing the management or operation. Furthermore,
    impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable
    REIT subsidiary subject to certain conditions, and we may still
    treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from
    real property.

The term “interest” generally does not include any
    amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in
    part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount
    generally will not be excluded from the term
    “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed
    percentage of receipts or sales.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income
    tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a
    REIT for such year if we are eligible for relief. For taxable
    years beginning on or before October 22, 2004, these relief
    provisions generally will be available if: (1) our failure
    to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to
    willful neglect; (2) we attach a schedule of the sources of
    our income to our return; and (3) any incorrect information
    on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax.
    For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, these
    relief provisions generally will be available if
    (1) following our identification of the failure, we file a
    schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross
    income, and (2) the failure to meet such tests was due to
    reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.

It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under
    which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
    provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is
    imposed on an amount equal to (a) the gross income
    attributable to (1) 75% of our gross income over the amount
    of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% income test
    and (2) 95% of our gross income (90% of our gross income
    for taxable years beginning on or before October 22,
    2004) over the amount of qualifying gross income for
    purposes of the 95% income test, multiplied by (b) a
    fraction intended to reflect our profitability.

The Secretary of the Treasury is given broad authority to
    determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or
    not under the 75% and 95% gross income tests, or are to be
    excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes.

Asset Tests.

Within 30 days after the
    close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy
    several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our
    assets determined in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. At least 75% of the value of our total
    assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash
    items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of
    our operation), government securities and qualified temporary
    investments. Although the remaining 25% of our assets generally
    may be invested without restriction, we are prohibited from
    owning securities representing more than 10% of either the vote
    (the “10% vote test”) or value (the “10% value
    test”) of the outstanding securities of any issuer other
    than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT
    subsidiary. Further, no more than 25% of the total assets may be
    represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT
    subsidiaries (the “25% asset test”) and no more than
    5% of the value of our total assets may be represented by
    securities of any non-governmental issuer other than a qualified
    REIT subsidiary (the “5% asset test”), another REIT or
    a taxable REIT subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10%
    value test and the 25% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at
    the end of each quarter. There are special rules which provide
    relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to
    changes in the value of the assets of a REIT.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000,
    certain items are excluded from the 10% value test, including:
    (1) straight debt securities of an issuer (including
    straight debt that provides certain contingent



payments); (2) any loan to an individual or an estate;
    (3) any rental agreement described in Section 467 of
    the Internal Revenue Code, other than with a “related
    person”; (4) any obligation to pay rents from real
    property; (5) certain securities issued by a state or any
    subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign
    government, or any political subdivision thereof, or the
    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; (6) any security issued by a
    REIT; and (7) any other arrangement that, as determined by
    the Secretary of the Treasury, is excepted from the definition
    of security (“excluded securities”). Special rules
    apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and
    entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax
    purposes. If a REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds
    (1) straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership
    issuer and (2) securities of such issuer that are not
    excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1%
    of such issuer’s outstanding securities, the straight debt
    securities will be included in the 10% value test.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, a
    REIT’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not
    treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value
    test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt
    instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for
    purposes of applying the 10% value test (1) to the extent
    of the REIT’s interest as a partner in the partnership and
    (2) if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income
    (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would
    qualify for the 75% gross income test. For taxable years
    beginning after October 22, 2004, for purposes of the 10%
    value test, a REIT’s interest in a partnership’s
    assets is determined by the REIT’s proportionate interest
    in any securities issued by the partnership (other than the
    excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph).

For taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008, if the
    REIT or its QBU uses a foreign currency as its functional
    currency, the term “cash” includes such foreign
    currency, but only to the extent such foreign currency is
    (i) held for use in the normal course of the activities of
    the REIT or QBU which give rise to items of income or gain that
    are included in the 95% and 75% gross income tests or are
    directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under
    the 75% asset test, and (ii) not held in connection with
    dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in
    securities.

With respect to corrections of failures for which the
    requirements for corrections are satisfied after
    October 22, 2004, regardless of whether such failures
    occurred in taxable years beginning on, before or after such
    date, as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test
    or the 5% asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a
    REIT by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that
    does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT’s assets at
    the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided that
    the disposition occurs within six months following the last day
    of the quarter in which the REIT first identified the assets.
    For violations of any of the REIT asset tests due to reasonable
    cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds
    described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid
    disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter
    by taking certain steps, including disposition of sufficient
    assets within the six month period described above to meet the
    applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to the greater of
    $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net
    income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period
    of time that the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and
    filing a schedule with the Internal Revenue Service that
    describes the non-qualifying assets.

Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.

For
    taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, REITs may
    own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in
    taxable REIT subsidiaries. We and any taxable corporate entity
    in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to
    treat such entity as a “taxable REIT subsidiary.”

Certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a
    taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject
    to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but
    are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that
    cannot be performed directly by REITs without jeopardizing their
    REIT status. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries will attempt to
    minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can be no
    assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to
    minimize taxes will be successful. To the extent our taxable
    REIT subsidiaries are required to pay federal, state or local
    taxes, the cash available for distribution as dividends to us
    from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced.

The amount of interest on related-party debt that a taxable REIT
    subsidiary may deduct is limited. Further, a 100% tax applies to
    any interest payments by a taxable REIT subsidiary to its
    affiliated REIT to the extent the



interest rate is not commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT
    subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated
    parties without any of these restrictions.

The Internal Revenue Service may reallocate costs between a REIT
    and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is a lack of
    arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any deductible
    expenses allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would
    increase its tax liability. Further, any amount by which a REIT
    understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable
    REIT subsidiary will, subject to certain exceptions, be subject
    to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may
    be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an
    interest.

Annual Distribution Requirements.

In order to
    avoid being taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to
    make distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to
    our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction
    in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of (i) 90%
    of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard
    to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and
    (ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from
    foreclosure property, minus (2) a portion of certain items
    of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid in the
    taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable
    year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that
    year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution
    payment after such declaration. The amount distributed must not
    be preferential. This means that every stockholder of the class
    of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the
    same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of
    stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its
    dividend rights as a class. To the extent that we do not
    distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least
    90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,”
    as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed
    amount at regular corporate tax rates. Finally, as discussed
    above, we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet
    certain other distribution requirements. We intend to make
    timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual
    distribution requirements.

It is possible that, from time to time, we may not have
    sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%
    distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount
    as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to,
    among other things, (1) timing differences between
    (i) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of
    deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and
    deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or
    (2) the payment of severance benefits that may not be
    deductible to us. In the event that timing differences occur, we
    may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or, if possible,
    pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to
    meet the distribution requirement.

Under certain circumstances, in the event of a deficiency
    determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be able to
    rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement
    for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to
    stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our
    deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year. Thus, we
    may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as
    deficiency dividends; however, we will be required to pay
    applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any
    deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions.

The Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Procedure

2008-68,

which provided temporary relief to publicly traded REITs seeking
    to preserve liquidity by electing cash/stock dividends. Under
    Revenue Procedure

2008-68,

a
    REIT may treat the entire dividend, including the stock portion,
    as a taxable dividend distribution, thereby qualifying for the
    dividends-paid deduction, provided certain requirements are
    satisfied. The cash portion of the dividend may be as low as
    10%. Revenue Procedure

2008-68,

as
    amplified by Revenue Procedure

2010-12,

applies to dividends declared on or before December 31,
    2012, and with respect to a taxable year ending on or before
    December 31, 2011.

Failure
    to Qualify as a REIT

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable
    year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any
    applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at
    regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any
    year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be
    deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be
    required to be made in any year. All distributions to
    stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of
    current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these
    distributions and, subject to certain limitations, will be
    eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate
    stockholders. Unless entitled



to relief under specific statutory provisions, we also will be
    disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years
    following the year during which qualification was lost. It is
    not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be
    entitled to statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one
    year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate
    investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting
    tax liabilities.

In addition to the relief described above under
    “— Income Tests” and “— Asset
    Tests,” relief is available in the event that we violate a
    provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would result in our
    failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due
    to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we
    pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to satisfy the
    provision; and (3) the violation does not include a
    violation described under “— Income Tests”
    or “— Asset Tests” above. It is not now
    possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be
    entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions.

Federal
    Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock

Treatment of Taxable
    U.S. Stockholders.

The following summary
    applies to you only if you are a
    “U.S. stockholder.” A
    “U.S. stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock
    who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is:

•

a citizen or resident of the United States;

•

a corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a
    corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
    organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any
    political subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•

an estate, the income of which is subject to United States
    federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•

a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise
    primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one
    or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal
    Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the
    trust’s substantial decisions.

So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, distributions on
    shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated
    earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not
    designated as capital gain dividends) will be includable as
    ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. None of these
    distributions will be eligible for the dividends received
    deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.

Generally, for taxable years ending after May 6, 2003
    through December 31, 2012, the maximum marginal rate of tax
    payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations
    that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15%. Except in
    limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to dividends
    paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not
    subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable
    income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The
    reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that
    portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect to
    our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received
    by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT
    subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect
    to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax
    during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute
    100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or
    (3) the amount of any earnings and profits that were
    distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year.

Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will
    be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not
    exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year),
    without regard to the period for which you held our stock.
    However, if you are a corporation, you may be required to treat
    a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income.

If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net long-term
    capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital
    gain, your proportionate share of this net long-term capital
    gain. You would also receive a refundable tax credit for your
    proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained
    capital gains, and you would have an increase in the basis of
    your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable
    capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid.



You may not include in your federal income tax return any of our
    net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules
    may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and
    preferences be apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution
    declared by us in October, November or December of any year on a
    specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid
    by us and received by you on December 31 of that year, provided
    that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than
    January 31 of the following year.

We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to
    treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required
    to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise
    tax discussed under “— General” and
    “— Qualification as a REIT — Annual
    Distribution Requirements” above. As a result, you may be
    required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions
    that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital.
    Moreover, any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as
    a dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as
    the case may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any
    other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings
    and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these
    distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your
    shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax
    basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these
    distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero, after
    which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if
    the shares of our stock are held as capital assets. The tax
    basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain
    or loss, if any, realized upon sale of the shares of our stock.
    Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which
    were held for six months or less (after application of certain
    holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term
    capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain
    distributions with respect to these shares of our stock.

Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with
    a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of
    our stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us,
    you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the
    difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange
    and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock. This
    gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock
    as a capital asset.

If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment can only be
    determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of
    redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as
    opposed to dividend income) equal to the difference between the
    amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax
    basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption:
    (1) results in a “complete termination” of your
    interest in all classes of our equity securities; (2) is a
    “substantially disproportionate redemption”; or
    (3) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend”
    with respect to you. In applying these tests, you must take into
    account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities
    (e.g., common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and
    warrants). You also must take into account any equity securities
    that are considered to be constructively owned by you.

If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you no
    longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity
    securities or only own (actually and constructively) an
    insubstantial percentage of our equity securities, then it is
    probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered
    “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and, thus,
    would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a
    distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a
    dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances,
    and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption,
    you should consult your tax advisor to determine their
    application to the particular situation.

Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests described
    above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of
    your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a
    dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or
    accumulated earnings and profits. If the redemption is taxed as
    a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will
    be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If
    you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain
    circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related
    person, or it may be lost entirely.

Gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than
    one year is taxed at a maximum long-term capital gain rate,
    which is currently 15%. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service
    guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends
    as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as
    gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%.

On March 30, 2010, the President signed into law the Health
    Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which requires
    U.S. stockholders who meet certain requirements and are
    individuals, estates or certain trusts to pay



an additional 3.8% tax on, among other things, dividends on and
    capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stock for
    taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012.
    U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors
    regarding the effect, if any, of this legislation on their
    ownership and disposition of shares of our stock.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt
    U.S. Stockholders.

Tax-exempt entities,
    including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts
    and individual retirement accounts (“Exempt
    Organizations”), generally are exempt from federal income
    taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their
    unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The
    Internal Revenue Service has issued a published revenue ruling
    that dividend distributions from a REIT to an exempt employee
    pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares
    of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or
    business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on this
    ruling, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations
    generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt
    Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock
    with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI
    pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules.
    Likewise, a portion of the Exempt Organization’s income
    from us would constitute UBTI if we held a residual interest in
    a real estate mortgage investment conduit.

In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns
    more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a percentage of
    our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension trust
    holding more than 10% of our stock only if: (1) the
    percentage of our income that is UBTI (determined as if we were
    a pension trust) is at least 5%; (2) we qualify as a REIT
    by reason of the modification of the Five or Fewer Requirement
    that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as
    holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the
    pension trust; and (3) either (i) one pension trust
    owns more than 25% of the value of our stock, or (ii) a
    group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of
    the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the
    value of our stock.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

Under certain circumstances, you may
    be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments
    made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of,
    shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply only if you:
    (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
    number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your
    social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer
    identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
    Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments
    of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under
    penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer
    identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has
    not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made
    to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and
    tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor
    regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding,
    and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding
    is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup
    withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be
    allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s United
    States federal income tax liability and may entitle such
    stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information
    is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition,
    withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to
    stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to
    certify their non-foreign status.

Taxation of Foreign Stockholders.

The
    following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign
    person. The federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly
    complex matter that may be affected by many considerations.

Except as discussed below, distributions to you of cash
    generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary
    dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital
    assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax
    at a rate of 30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that
    tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower
    rate.

In general, you will be subject to United States federal income
    tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with
    respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is
    “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade
    or business in the United States. A corporate foreign
    stockholder that receives income that is, or is treated as,
    effectively connected with a United States trade or business may
    also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in
    addition to regular United States corporate income tax. The
    following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose
    investment in us is not so effectively connected. We expect to
    withhold United States



income tax, as described below, on the gross amount of any
    distributions paid to you unless (1) you file an Internal
    Revenue Service

Form W-8ECI

with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively
    connected” or (2) certain other exceptions apply.

Distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale
    or exchange of a United States real property interest will be
    taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax
    Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were
    gains “effectively connected” with a United States
    trade or business. Accordingly, you will be taxed at the normal
    capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on
    these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax
    and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident
    alien individuals. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be
    subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate
    foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption.

We will be required to withhold from distributions subject to
    FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of
    designated capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the
    amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital
    gain dividends. In addition, if we designate prior distributions
    as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions, up to the
    amount of the prior distributions not withheld against, will be
    treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.

For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, any
    capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is
    “regularly traded” on an established securities market
    will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign
    stockholder did not own more than 5% of such class of stock at
    any time during the taxable year. Once this provision takes
    effect, foreign stockholders generally will not be required to
    report distributions received from us on U.S. federal
    income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends
    for U.S. federal income tax purposes including any capital
    gain dividend will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax
    (unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as
    discussed above. In addition, the branch profits tax will no
    longer apply to such distributions.

Unless our shares constitute a “United States real property
    interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively
    connected with a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our
    shares by you generally will not be subject to United States
    taxation. Our shares will not constitute a United States real
    property interest if we qualify as a “domestically
    controlled REIT.” We believe that we, and expect to
    continue to, qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. A
    domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times
    during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its
    shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders.
    However, if you are a nonresident alien individual who is
    present in the United States for 183 days or more during
    the taxable year and certain other conditions apply, you will be
    subject to a 30% tax on such capital gains. In any event, a
    purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under
    FIRPTA to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares
    are “regularly traded” on an established securities
    market or if we are a domestically controlled REIT. Otherwise,
    under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be required to withhold 10% of
    the purchase price and remit such amount to the Internal Revenue
    Service.

Backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally
    not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States
    that are treated as: (1) dividends to which the 30% or
    lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies;
    (2) capital gains dividends; or (3) distributions
    attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of
    U.S. real property interests. Payment of the proceeds of a
    sale of stock within the United States or conducted through
    certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is subject to
    both backup withholding and information reporting unless the
    beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or
    she is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have
    actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a
    U.S. person) or otherwise established an exemption. You may
    obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
    withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund
    with the Internal Revenue Service.

Recently enacted legislation will require, after
    December 31, 2012, withholding at a rate of 30% on
    dividends in respect of, and gross proceeds from the sale of,
    shares of our stock held by or through certain foreign financial
    institutions (including investment funds), unless such
    institution enters into an agreement with the Secretary of the
    Treasury to report, on an annual basis, information with respect
    to shares in the institution held by certain U.S. persons
    and by certain

non-U.S. entities

that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons, and to
    withhold on certain payments. Accordingly, the entity through
    which shares of stock is held will affect the determination of



whether such withholding is required. Similarly, dividends in
    respect of, and gross proceeds from the sale of, shares of our
    stock held by an investor that is a non-financial

non-U.S. entity

will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such
    entity either (i) certifies to us that such entity does not
    have any “substantial United States owners” or
    (ii) provides certain information regarding the
    entity’s “substantial United States owners,”
    which we will in turn provide to the Secretary of the Treasury.
    We will not pay any additional amounts to any stockholders in
    respect of any amounts withheld. Foreign persons are encouraged
    to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible
    implications of the legislation on their investment in shares of
    our stock.

U.S.
    Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Depositary
    Shares

Owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were
    owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the
    depositary shares. Thus, you will be required to take into
    account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled
    if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock.

Conversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred
    Stock.

No gain or loss will be recognized upon
    the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary
    shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will,
    upon exchange, be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the
    depositary shares exchanged. If you held your depositary shares
    as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of
    preferred stock, the holding period for your shares of preferred
    stock will include the period during which you owned the
    depositary shares.

U.S.
    Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Debt
    Securities

The following is a general summary of the United States federal
    income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder
    that is a

non-U.S. holder,

as defined below, the United States federal estate tax
    consequences, of purchasing, owning and disposing of debt
    securities periodically offered under one or more indentures
    (the “notes”). This summary assumes that you hold the
    notes as capital assets. This summary applies to you only if you
    are the initial holder of the notes and you acquire the notes
    for a price equal to the issue price of the notes. The issue
    price of the notes is the first price at which a substantial
    amount of the notes is sold other than to bond houses, brokers
    or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
    underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. In addition, this
    summary does not consider any foreign, state, local or other tax
    laws that may be applicable to us or a purchaser of the notes.

U.S.
    Holders

The following summary applies to you only if you are a
    U.S. holder, as defined below.

Definition of a U.S. Holder.

A
    “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a note or
    notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes:

•

a citizen or resident of the United States;

•

a corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a
    corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
    organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any
    political subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•

an estate, the income of which is subject to United States
    federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•

a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise
    primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one
    or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal
    Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the
    trust’s substantial decisions.

Payments of Interest.

Stated interest on the
    notes generally will be taxed as ordinary interest income from
    domestic sources at the time it is paid or accrues in accordance
    with your method of accounting for tax purposes.



Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of
    Notes.

The adjusted tax basis in your note
    acquired at a premium will generally be your cost. You generally
    will recognize taxable gain or loss when you sell or otherwise
    dispose of your notes equal to the difference, if any, between:

•

the amount realized on the sale or other disposition, less any
    amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will be
    taxable in the manner described under “— Payments
    of Interest” above; and

•

your adjusted tax basis in the notes.

Your gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. This
    capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if
    at the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the
    notes for more than one year. Subject to limited exceptions,
    your capital losses cannot be used to offset your ordinary
    income.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

In general, “backup
    withholding” may apply to any payments made to you of
    principal and interest on your note, and to payment of the
    proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your note before
    maturity, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder and:
    (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
    number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your
    social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer
    identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
    Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments
    of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under
    penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer
    identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has
    not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.

The amount of any reportable payments, including interest, made
    to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of
    tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be
    reported to you and to the Internal Revenue Service for each
    calendar year. You should consult your tax advisor regarding
    your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and
    the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable.
    The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be
    credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability,
    provided that correct information is provided to the Internal
    Revenue Service.

Non-U.S.

Holders

The following summary applies to you if you are a beneficial
    owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above
    (a

“non-U.S. holder”).

Special rules may apply to certain

non-U.S. holders

such as “controlled foreign corporations,”
    “passive foreign investment companies” and
    “foreign personal holding companies.” Such entities
    are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the
    United States federal, state, local and other tax consequences
    that may be relevant to them.

U.S. Federal Withholding Tax.

Subject to
    the discussion below, U.S. federal withholding tax will not
    apply to payments by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as
    such, of principal and interest on your notes under the
    “portfolio interest” exception of the Internal Revenue
    Code, provided that:

•

you do not, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively,
    own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
    classes of our stock entitled to vote;

•

you are not (1) a controlled foreign corporation for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related, directly
    or indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership, as
    provided in the Internal Revenue Code, or (2) a bank
    receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
    Internal Revenue Code;

•

such interest is not effectively connected with your conduct of
    a U.S. trade or business; and

•

you provide a signed written statement, under penalties of
    perjury, which can reliably be related to you, certifying that
    you are not a U.S. person within the meaning of the
    Internal Revenue Code and providing your name and address to:

•

us or our paying agent; or

•

a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial
    institution that holds customers’ securities in the
    ordinary course of its trade or business and holds your notes on
    your behalf and that certifies to us or our paying agent under
    penalties of perjury that it, or the bank or financial
    institution between it and you, has received from you your
    signed, written statement and provides us or our paying agent
    with a copy of such statement.



Treasury regulations provide that:

•

if you are a foreign partnership, the certification requirement
    will generally apply to your partners, and you will be required
    to provide certain information;

•

if you are a foreign trust, the certification requirement will
    generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners depending
    on whether you are a “foreign complex trust,”
    “foreign simple trust,” or “foreign grantor
    trust” as defined in the Treasury regulations; and

•

look-through rules will apply for tiered partnerships, foreign
    simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts.

If you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, you should
    consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these
    Treasury regulations and the certification requirements
    applicable to you.

If you cannot satisfy the portfolio interest requirements
    described above, payments of interest will be subject to the 30%
    United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a
    properly executed (1) Internal Revenue Service

Form W-8BEN

claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the
    benefit of an applicable treaty or (2) Internal Revenue
    Service

Form W-8ECI

stating that interest paid on the note is not subject to
    withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your
    conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Alternative
    documentation may be applicable in certain circumstances.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States
    and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct
    of that trade or business, you will be required to pay United
    States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis
    (although you will be exempt from the 30% withholding tax
    provided the certification requirement described above is met)
    in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as
    otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a
    foreign corporation, you may be required to pay a branch profits
    tax on the earnings and profits that are effectively connected
    to the conduct of your trade or business in the United States.

Recent legislation generally will impose U.S. withholding
    tax at a 30% rate on payments of interest (including original
    issue discount) and proceeds of sale in respect of debt
    instruments to certain

non-U.S. holders

if certain additional disclosure requirements related to
    U.S. ownership of such

non-U.S. holders

or U.S. accounts maintained by such

non-U.S. holders

are not satisfied. However, the withholding tax will not be
    imposed on payments pursuant to debt or other obligations
    outstanding as of March 18, 2012. If payment of withholding
    taxes is required,

non-U.S. holders

that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from, or reduction
    of, U.S. withholding taxes with respect to such
    distributions and proceeds of a sale of such notes will be
    entitled to seek a refund from the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) to obtain the benefit of such exemption or
    reduction. We will not pay any additional amounts to

non-U.S. holders

in respect of any amounts withheld. These new withholding rules
    are generally effective for payments made after
    December 31, 2012.

Sale, Exchange or other Disposition of
    Notes.

You generally will not have to pay
    U.S. federal income tax on any gain or income realized from
    the sale, redemption, retirement at maturity or other
    disposition of your notes, unless:

•

in the case of gain, you are an individual who is present in the
    United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year
    of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific
    other conditions are met;

•

you are subject to tax provisions applicable to certain United
    States expatriates; or

•

the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a
    U.S. trade or business.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States,
    and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected
    with the conduct of that trade or business, you generally will
    be subject to U.S. income tax on a net basis on the gain.
    In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be
    subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected
    earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for
    certain items.

U.S. Federal Estate Tax.

If you are an
    individual and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the
    United States, as specially defined for U.S. federal estate
    tax purposes, at the time of your death, your notes will
    generally not be subject to the U.S. federal estate tax,
    unless, at the time of your death (1) you owned actually or
    constructively 10%



or more of the total combined voting power of all our classes of
    stock entitled to vote, or (2) interest on the notes is
    effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or
    business.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

Backup withholding will not apply to
    payments of principal or interest made by us or our paying
    agent, in its capacity as such, to you if you have provided the
    required certification that you are a

non-U.S. holder

as described in “— U.S. Federal Withholding
    Tax” above, and provided that neither we nor our paying
    agent have actual knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as
    described in “— U.S. Holders” above. We
    or our paying agent may, however, report payments of interest on
    the notes.

The gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes may be
    subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If
    you sell your notes outside the United States through a

non-U.S. office

of a

non-U.S. broker

and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United
    States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information
    reporting requirements generally will not apply to that payment.
    However, U.S. information reporting, but not backup
    withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if
    that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell
    your notes through a

non-U.S. office

of a broker that:

•

is a U.S. person, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code;

•

derives 50% or more of its gross income in specific periods from
    the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;

•

is a “controlled foreign corporation” for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes; or

•

is a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year,
    one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who in the
    aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests
    in the partnership, or the foreign partnership is engaged in a
    U.S. trade or business, unless the broker has documentary
    evidence in its files that you are a

non-U.S. person

and certain other conditions are met or you otherwise establish
    an exemption. If you receive payments of the proceeds of a sale
    of your notes to or through a U.S. office of a broker, the
    payment is subject to both U.S. backup withholding and
    information reporting unless you provide a

Form W-8BEN

certifying that you are a

non-U.S. person

or you otherwise establish an exemption.

You should consult your own tax advisor regarding application of
    backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the
    availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from
    backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup
    withholding rules from a payment to you will be allowed as a
    refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax
    liability, provided the required information is furnished to the
    Internal Revenue Service.

U.S.
    Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our
    Warrants

Exercise of Warrants.

You will not generally
    recognize gain or loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your
    basis in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares
    or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise
    of the warrant will be equal to the sum of your adjusted tax
    basis in the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding
    period in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary
    shares or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the
    exercise of the warrant will not include the period during which
    the warrant was held by you.

Expiration of Warrants.

Upon the expiration of
    a warrant, you will recognize a capital loss in an amount equal
    to your adjusted tax basis in the warrant.

Sale or Exchange of Warrants.

Upon the sale or
    exchange of a warrant to a person other than us, you will
    recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
    between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your
    adjusted tax basis in the warrant. Such gain or loss will be
    capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss
    if the warrant was held for more than one year. Upon the sale of
    the warrant to us, the Internal Revenue Service may argue that
    you should recognize ordinary income on the sale. You are
    advised to consult your own tax advisors as to the consequences
    of a sale of a warrant to us.



Potential
    Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax
    Consequences

Current and prospective securities holders should recognize that
    the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us
    may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative
    action at any time and that any such action may affect
    investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing
    with federal income taxation are constantly under review by
    persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal
    Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in
    revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of
    established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in
    federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could
    adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Forward-Looking
    Statements and Risk Factors

This section discusses the most significant factors that affect
    our business, operations and financial condition. It does not
    describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our
    industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following
    risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet
    identified or that we currently think are not material, actually
    occur, we could be materially adversely affected. In that event,
    the value of our securities could decline.

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements
    that constitute “forward-looking statements” as that
    term is defined in the federal securities laws. These
    forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
    those regarding:

•

the possible expansion of our portfolio;

•

the sale of properties;

•

the performance of our operators/tenants and properties;

•

our ability to enter into agreements with new viable tenants for
    vacant space or for properties that we take back from
    financially troubled tenants, if any;

•

our occupancy rates;

•

our ability to acquire, develop

and/or

manage properties;

•

our ability to make distributions to stockholders;

•

our policies and plans regarding investments, financings and
    other matters;

•

our tax status as a real estate investment trust;

•

our critical accounting policies;

•

our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity;

•

our ability to access capital markets or other sources of
    funds; and

•

our ability to meet our earnings guidance.

When we use words such as “may,” “will,”
    “intend,” “should,” “believe,”
    “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,”
    “estimate” or similar expressions, we are making
    forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not
    guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
    uncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and



actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This
    may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited
    to:

•

the status of the economy;

•

the status of capital markets, including availability and cost
    of capital;

•

issues facing the health care industry, including compliance
    with, and changes to, regulations and payment policies,
    responding to government investigations and punitive settlements
    and operators’/tenants’ difficulty in cost-effectively
    obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;

•

changes in financing terms;

•

competition within the health care, senior housing and life
    science industries;

•

negative developments in the operating results or financial
    condition of operators/tenants, including, but not limited to,
    their ability to pay rent and repay loans;

•

our ability to transition or sell facilities with profitable
    results;

•

the failure to make new investments as and when anticipated;

•

acts of God affecting our properties;

•

our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies
    occur;

•

our ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to
    assets sold;

•

operator/tenant or joint venture partner bankruptcies or
    insolvencies;

•

the cooperation of joint venture partners;

•

government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid
    reimbursement rates and operational requirements;

•

regulatory approval and market acceptance of the products and
    technologies of life science tenants;

•

liability or contract claims by or against operators/tenants;

•

unanticipated difficulties

and/or

expenditures relating to future acquisitions;

•

environmental laws affecting our properties;

•

changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting;

•

other legal and operational matters, including REIT
    qualification and key management personnel recruitment and
    retention; and

•

the risks described below:

Risk
    factors related to our operators’ revenues and
    expenses

Our investment property operators’ revenues are primarily
    driven by occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if
    applicable, and private pay rates. Expenses for these facilities
    are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities,
    taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from
    government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under
    pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.
    Liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for
    our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues

and/or

any
    increase in operating expenses result in a property not
    generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our
    operator and the value of other collateral would have to be
    relied upon.

The recent credit and liquidity crisis, and the weakened
    economy, may have a lingering adverse effect on our operators
    and tenants, including their ability to access credit or
    maintain occupancy rates. If the operations, cash flows or
    financial condition of our operators are materially adversely
    impacted by economic conditions, our revenue and operations may
    be adversely affected.



Increased
    competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their
    obligations to us

The operators of our properties compete on a local and regional
    basis with operators of properties and other health care
    providers that provide comparable services. We cannot be certain
    that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to
    achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable
    them to meet all of their obligations to us. Our operators are
    expected to encounter increased competition in the future that
    could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their
    businesses.

Risk
    factors related to obligor bankruptcies

We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to
    meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,
    which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that
    an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency
    proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease
    agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand
    immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our
    loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding
    obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid
    interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other
    remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain
    rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or
    reorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject to
    insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability
    to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive
    unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to
    exercise other rights and remedies.

We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate
    taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment
    property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property

and/or

transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we
    have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property
    to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided
    working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new
    obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new
    tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may
    expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events
    occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely
    affected.

Transfers
    of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and
    these facilities may not have efficient alternative
    uses

Transfers of health care facilities to successor operators
    frequently are subject to regulatory approvals or notifications,
    including, but not limited to, change of ownership approvals
    under certificate of need (“CON”) laws, state
    licensure laws and Medicare and Medicaid provider arrangements,
    that are not required for transfers of other types of real
    estate. The replacement of a health care facility operator could
    be delayed by the approval process of any federal, state or
    local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the
    replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility.
    Alternatively, given the specialized nature of our facilities,
    we may be required to spend substantial time and funds to adapt
    these properties to other uses. If we are unable to timely
    transfer properties to successor operators or find efficient
    alternative uses, our revenue and operations may be adversely
    affected.

Risk
    factors related to government regulations

Our obligors’ businesses are affected by government
    reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that an
    operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues
    from government payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such
    revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,
    retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments
    or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,
    payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers,
    government funding restrictions (at a program level or with
    respect to specific facilities) and interruption or delays in
    payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits
    at such property. In recent years, government payors have frozen
    or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary
    pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be
    of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We
    cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect
    any future legislative reforms may have on the financial
    condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no
    assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available
    for services provided by any property operator, whether the
    property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or
    private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services
    reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a
    material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity,
    financial



condition and results of operations, which could adversely
    affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us.
    See “Item 1 — Business — Certain
    Government Regulations — Reimbursement” above.

Our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive
    federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,
    certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards.
    Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any
    of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of
    accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines,
    suspension or decertification from federal and state health care
    programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such
    actions may have an effect on our operators’ or
    tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and,
    therefore, adversely impact us. See
    “Item 1 — Business — Certain
    Government Regulations — Other Related Laws”
    above.

Many of our properties may require a license, registration,

and/or

CON
    to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON,
    or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would
    prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the
    operators or tenants. These events could materially adversely
    affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent
    payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the
    expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or
    acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or
    renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or
    other similar approval from a state agency. See
    “Item 1 — Business — Certain
    Government Regulations — Licensing and
    Certification” above.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
    (“ARRA”), which was signed into law on
    February 17, 2009, provides $87 billion in additional
    federal Medicaid funding for states’ Medicaid expenditures
    between October 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. On
    August 10, 2010, the President signed into law H.R. 1586,
    which mandates a six-month extension of the increase in federal
    Medicaid funding for states through June 30, 2011, although
    the enhanced federal Medicaid funding is scaled back for the
    first two quarters of 2011. Under both the ARRA and H.R. 1586,
    states meeting certain eligibility requirements will temporarily
    receive additional money in the form of an increase in the
    federal medical assistance percentage (“FMAP”). Thus,
    for a limited period of time, the share of Medicaid costs that
    are paid for by the federal government will go up, and each
    state’s share will go down. We cannot predict whether
    states are, or will remain, eligible to receive the additional
    federal Medicaid funding, or whether the states will have
    sufficient funds for their Medicaid programs. We also cannot
    predict the impact that such broad-based, far-reaching
    legislation will have on the U.S. economy or our business.

Risk
    factors related to liability claims and insurance
    costs

In recent years, skilled nursing and seniors housing operators
    have experienced substantial increases in both the number and
    size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and
    professional liability costs have increased in some markets.
    However, a recent report and state survey found that the
    liability insurance market is beginning to stabilize in most
    markets. In 2008, national average liability loss costs were
    stable for the first time in nearly a decade. State-led tort
    reform efforts have greatly contributed to decreasing costs. In
    some markets general and professional liability insurance
    coverage continues to be restricted or very costly, which in
    some cases has caused operators to self-insure. These
    developments may adversely affect the property operators’
    future operations, cash flows and financial condition, and may
    have a material adverse effect on the property operators’
    ability to meet their obligations to us.

Risk
    factors related to acquisitions

We are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not
    prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated
    difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired
    properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired
    properties might require significant management attention that
    would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree
    to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the
    project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure
    completion of the project. Moreover, if we issue equity
    securities or incur additional debt, or both, to finance future
    acquisitions, it may reduce our per share financial results.
    These costs may negatively affect our results of operations.



Risk
    factors related to joint ventures

We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter
    into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or
    entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not
    be present with other methods of ownership, including the
    possibility that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to
    make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet
    its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us
    for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at
    any time have economic or other business interests or goals that
    are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we
    could become engaged in a dispute with our partner, which could
    require us to expend additional resources to resolve such
    disputes and could have an adverse impact on the operations and
    profitability of the joint venture; and that our partner may be
    in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our
    instructions or requests. In addition, our ability to transfer
    our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be
    restricted. In some instances, we

and/or

our
    partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement,
    which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our
    partner’s interest, at a time when we otherwise would not
    have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our
    partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have
    sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital
    resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interest
    in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain
    it. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making
    authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to
    control the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have
    a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require
    partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of
    a property.

Risk
    factors related to life sciences facilities

Our tenants in the life sciences industry face high levels of
    regulation, expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect
    their ability to make payments to us. Research, development and
    clinical testing of products and technologies can be very
    expensive and sources of funds may not be available to our life
    sciences tenants in the future. The products and technologies
    that are developed and manufactured by our life sciences tenants
    may require regulatory approval prior to being made, marketed,
    sold and used. The regulatory process can be costly, long and
    unpredictable. Even after a tenant gains regulatory approval and
    market acceptance, the product still presents regulatory and
    liability risks, such as safety concerns, competition from new
    products and eventually the expiration of patent protection.
    These factors may affect the ability of our life sciences
    tenants to make timely payments to us, which may adversely
    affect our revenue and operations.

Risk
    factors related to indebtedness

Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided
    through a combination of public and private offerings of debt
    and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of
    secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may
    cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require
    us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment
    of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn
    in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional
    financing, or (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or
    outlook by one or more of the noted rating agencies.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require
    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth
    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
    create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of
    these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments
    governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other
    indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These
    defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Risk
    factors related to our credit ratings

We plan to manage the Company to maintain a capital structure
    consistent with our current profile, but there can be no
    assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit
    ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or
    all of the noted rating agencies could have a material adverse
    impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in
    turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results
    of operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition.



Risk
    factors related to interest rate swaps

We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to
    manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility. These
    swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that
    counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these
    arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be
    effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.
    When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a
    risk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against
    which the swap is intended to hedge. If such events occur, our
    results of operations may be adversely affected.

Risk
    factors related to environmental laws

Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of
    real estate may be required to respond to the presence or
    release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held
    liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that
    result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous
    substances. We may become liable to reimburse the government for
    damages and costs it incurs in connection with the
    contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person
    based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our
    tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition
    of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site
    assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to
    taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to
    meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we
    believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if
    environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we
    do not believe that any of our properties are subject to
    material environmental contamination. However, environmental
    liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur
    costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the
    business or financial condition of our obligors.

Risk
    factors related to facilities that require entrance
    fees

Certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of
    an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may
    be refundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are
    subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to
    these funds. As a result of this oversight, residents of these
    facilities may have a variety of rights, including, for example,
    the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of
    time and certain lien rights. The oversight and rights of
    residents within these facilities may have an effect on the
    revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and
    therefore may negatively impact us.

Risk
    factors related to facilities under construction or
    development

At any given time, we may be in the process of constructing one
    or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON and
    license before they can be utilized by the operator for their
    intended use. The operator also may need to obtain Medicare and
    Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid
    provider agreements

and/or

third
    party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable
    to obtain the necessary CON, licensure, certification, provider
    agreements or contracts after the completion of construction,
    there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on
    the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license
    or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary
    provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract
    with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate
    the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider
    agreements or contracts.

In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development
    and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain,
    or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use,
    building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and
    authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or
    our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be
    able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us
    unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may
    not be able to complete construction and

lease-up

of
    a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt
    service expense or construction costs.

Additionally, the time frame required for development,
    construction and

lease-up

of
    these properties means that we may have to wait years for
    significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash
    distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from
    operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to
    borrow



additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and
    acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we
    expect, which could adversely affect our overall financial
    performance.

In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property,
    we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of
    that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our
    investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates. If our
    financial projections with respect to a new property are
    inaccurate, and the property is unable to achieve the expected
    occupancy and rental rates, it may fail to perform as we
    expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs
    of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove
    to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our
    profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties
    that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing
    operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and
    debt service associated with that property.

We do
    not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases, and if
    they do not, we may be unable to lease the properties on as
    favorable terms, or at all

We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases
    at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times.
    If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find
    other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them. There can
    be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable
    replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on
    terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would
    be able to lease those properties at all.

Our
    ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the
    loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground
    leases

We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by
    acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the
    building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in
    the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases.
    As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the
    possibility of losing the property upon termination of the
    ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.

Illiquidity
    of real estate investments could significantly impede our
    ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our
    properties

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to
    quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to
    changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No
    assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for
    any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons.
    Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance
    of our investments could adversely affect our financial
    condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed
    to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real
    estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care
    industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could
    adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to
    sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us.

Risk
    factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds

From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the
    proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments
    on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,
    including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master
    leases or similar financial support arrangements. In order to
    maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive
    returns, we expect to re-invest these proceeds in a timely
    manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad
    variety of potential investors. This competition for attractive
    investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely
    investments on terms acceptable to us.

Failure
    to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our
    management or increase our expenses

We have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively
    short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in
    the future. This growth has resulted in increased levels of
    responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions
    could place significant additional demands on, and require us to
    expand, our management, resources and personnel. Our failure to
    manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business
    and, in particular, our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows, which could negatively



affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our
    growth could also increase our capital requirements, which may
    require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and
    incur additional debt.

We
    might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a
    REIT

We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code
    and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a
    manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious
    income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds
    available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to
    our stockholders because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to
    stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be
    subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate
    rates;

•

we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and
    possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we
    could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable
    years following the year during which we were disqualified.

Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex
    requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them,
    and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of
    U.S. federal and other income taxes owed. A reduction in
    our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our
    stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we would not be
    required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT
    is not required, in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an
    excise tax, to pay dividends to stockholders. See
    “Item 1 — Business —
    Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations” for
    a discussion of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that
    apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a REIT.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions
    to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the
    extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits,
    although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the
    dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be
    eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to
    long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%)
    with respect to distributions.

As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a
    REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business
    strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common
    stock.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly
    technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which
    there are only limited judicial and administrative
    interpretations. The determination of various factual matters
    and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our
    ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that
    we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue
    to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal
    income tax purposes. See “Item 1 —
    Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax
    Considerations” included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The
    90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity
    and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial
    transactions

To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to
    REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make
    distributions to our stockholders. See
    “Item 1 — Business
    — Taxation — Federal Income Tax
    Considerations — Qualification as a REIT —
    Annual Distribution Requirements” included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient
    cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT
    distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to
    time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to
    meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we may decide to
    retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be
    necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due
    to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and
    actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the
    inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in
    arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition,
    non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or
    repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash
    deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or
    liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution
    requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we
    deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue
    additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that
    we will be able to do so), pay taxable



stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or
    securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable
    us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require
    us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations.

The amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by
    the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indentures
    governing our senior unsecured notes. In addition, adverse
    economic conditions may impact the availability of additional
    funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow
    additional funds to become unfavorable. In those circumstances,
    we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital
    markets. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors
    over which we have little or no control, including rising
    interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions
    and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our
    current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and
    the market price of the shares of our capital stock. We cannot
    assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary
    to make future investments or to meet our obligations and
    commitments as they mature.

The
    lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT
    subsidiary is subject to special requirements

We intend to lease certain qualified health care properties we
    acquire from operators to a taxable REIT subsidiary (or a
    limited liability company of which the taxable REIT subsidiary
    is a member), which lessee will contract with such operators (or
    a related party) to operate the health care operations at these
    properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee
    structure will be treated as qualifying rents from real property
    if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a
    qualified health care property with a taxable REIT subsidiary
    and (2) the operator qualifies as an eligible independent
    contractor. If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then
    the rents will not be qualifying rents. See
    “Item 1 — Business —
    Taxation — Federal Income Tax
    Considerations — Qualification as a REIT —
    Income Tests.”

If
    certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the
    IRS as “true leases,” we may be subject to adverse tax
    consequences

We may purchase properties and lease them back to the sellers of
    such properties. We intend for any such sale-leaseback
    transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease
    will be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby
    allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the
    terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the
    position that the transaction is not a “true lease”
    but is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event
    any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully
    re-characterized by the IRS, we would not be entitled to claim
    the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally
    available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a
    sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might
    fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and,
    consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year
    of re-characterization. See “Item 1 —
    Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax
    Considerations — Qualification as a REIT —
    Asset Tests” and “— Income Tests.”
    Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be
    recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual
    distribution requirements for a taxable year. See
    “Item 1 — Business —
    Taxation — Federal Income Tax
    Considerations — Qualification as a REIT —
    Annual Distribution Requirements.”

Other
    risk factors

We are also subject to other risks. First, our Second Restated
    Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated
    By-Laws contain anti-takeover provisions (staggered board
    provisions, restrictions on share ownership and transfer and
    super majority stockholder approval requirements for business
    combinations) that could make it more difficult for or even
    prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of
    our incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that
    inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market
    value of our common stock.

Additionally, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we
    have entered into employment agreements with our executive
    officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily,
    have an adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing
    more than one could have a material adverse impact on our
    business.

Health
    Care Industry

The demand for health care services, and consequently health
    care properties, is projected to reach unprecedented levels in
    the near future. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
    (“CMS”) projects that national health expenditures
    will rise to $3.5 trillion in 2015 or 18.2% of gross domestic
    product (“GDP”). The average annual growth in national
    health expenditures for 2009 through 2019 is expected to be
    6.3%, which is 0.2% faster than pre-health care reform estimates.

While demographics are the primary driver of demand, economic
    conditions and availability of services contribute to health
    care service utilization rates. We believe the health care
    property market may be less susceptible to fluctuations and
    economic downturns relative to other property sectors. Investor
    interest in the market remains strong, especially in specific
    sectors such as medical office buildings, regardless of the
    current stringent lending environment. As a REIT, we believe we
    are situated to benefit from any turbulence in the capital
    markets due to our access to capital.

The total U.S. population is projected to increase by 20.4%
    through 2030. The elderly population aged 65 and over is
    projected to increase by 79.2% through 2030. The elderly are an
    important component of health care



utilization, especially independent living services, assisted
    living services, skilled nursing services, inpatient and
    outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care. Most
    health care services are provided within a health care facility
    such as a hospital, a physician’s office or a senior
    housing facility. Therefore, we believe there will be continued
    demand for companies, such as ours, with expertise in health
    care real estate.

The following chart illustrates the projected increase in the
    elderly population aged 65 and over:

Source: U.S. Census Bureau

Health care real estate investment opportunities tend to
    increase as demand for health care services increases. We
    recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates
    to health care service demand. Health care providers require
    real estate to house their businesses and expand their services.
    We believe that investment opportunities in health care real
    estate will continue to be present due to:

•

The specialized nature of the industry, which enhances the
    credibility and experience of our company;

•

The projected population growth combined with stable or
    increasing health care utilization rates, which ensures
    demand; and

•

The on-going merger and acquisition activity.

Health
    Reform Laws

On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the
    Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”)
    and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010,
    which amends the PPACA (collectively, the “Health Reform
    Laws”). The Health Reform Laws contain various provisions
    that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our
    properties. Some provisions of the Health Reform Laws may have a
    positive impact on our operators’ or tenants’
    revenues, by, for example, increasing coverage of uninsured
    individuals, while others may have a negative impact on the
    reimbursement of our operators or tenants by, for example,
    altering the market basket adjustments for certain types of
    health care facilities. The Health Reform Laws also enhance
    certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions that could apply to
    our operators and tenants, in the event of one or more
    violations of the federal health care regulatory laws. In
    addition, there are provisions that impact the health coverage
    that we and our operators and tenants provide to our respective
    employees. We cannot predict whether the existing Health Reform
    Laws, or future health care reform legislation or regulatory
    changes, will have a material impact on our operators’ or
    tenants’ property or business. If the operations, cash
    flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are
    materially adversely impacted by the Health Reform Laws or
    future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely
    affected as well. Further, on February 2, 2011, the
    U.S. Senate refused to pass an overhaul repeal of the
    Health Reform Laws, and the focus has now shifted to attempts to
    repeal or amend individual sections of the Health Reform Laws.
    Further, federal courts are also considering, and in some cases
    have ruled on, the legality of the Health Reform Laws. We cannot
    predict whether any of these attempts to repeal or amend the
    Health Reform Laws will be successful, nor can we predict the
    impact that such a repeal or amendment would have on our
    operators and tenants.



Impact to Reimbursement of the Operators and Tenants of Our
    Properties.

The Health Reform Laws provide for
    various changes to the reimbursement that our operators and
    tenants may receive. One such change is a reduction to the
    market basket adjustments for inpatient acute hospitals,
    long-term care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities,
    home health agencies, psychiatric hospitals, hospice care and
    outpatient hospitals. Beginning in 2010, the otherwise
    applicable percentage increase to the market basket for
    inpatient acute hospitals will decrease. Beginning in 2012,
    inpatient acute hospitals will also face a downward adjustment
    of the annual percentage increase to the market basket rate by a
    “productivity adjustment.” The productivity adjustment
    may cause the annual percentage increase to be less than zero,
    which would mean that inpatient acute hospitals could face
    payment rates for a fiscal year that are less than the payment
    rates for the preceding year.

A similar productivity adjustment also applies to skilled
    nursing facilities beginning in 2012, which means that the
    payment rates for skilled nursing facilities may decrease from
    one year to the next. Long-term care hospitals will face a
    specified percentage decrease in their annual update for
    discharges beginning in 2010. Additionally, beginning in 2012,
    long-term care hospitals will be subject to the productivity
    adjustments, which may decrease the federal payment rates for
    long-term care hospitals. Similar productivity adjustments and
    other adjustments to payment rates will apply to inpatient
    rehabilitation facilities, psychiatric hospitals and outpatient
    hospitals beginning in 2010.

The Health Reform Laws revise other reimbursement provisions
    that may affect our business. For example, the Health Reform
    Laws mandate a one-year extension of the exceptions for medical
    therapy caps, which will be applicable though December 31,
    2010. The Health Reform Laws also reduce states’ Medicaid
    disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) allotments,
    starting in 2014 through 2020. These allotments would have
    provided additional funding for DSH hospitals that are operators
    or tenants of our properties, and thus, any reduction might
    negatively impact these operators or tenants.

Additionally, beginning in fiscal year 2015, Medicare payments
    will decrease to hospitals for treatment associated with
    hospital acquired conditions. This decreased payment rate may
    negatively impact our operators or tenants. The Health Reform
    Laws also call for reductions in payments for discharges
    beginning October 1, 2012, in order to account for excess
    readmissions. While the exact amount of the reduction is not yet
    known, a reduction in payments to our operators or tenants may
    affect their ability to make payments to us.

PPACA additionally calls for the creation of the Independent
    Payment Advisory Board (the “Board”), which will be
    responsible for establishing payment polices, including
    recommendations in the event that Medicare costs exceed a
    certain threshold. Proposals for recommendations submitted by
    the Board prior to December 31, 2018 may not include
    recommendations that would reduce payments for hospitals,
    skilled nursing facilities, and physicians, among other
    providers, prior to December 31, 2019. The Health Reform
    Laws also create other mechanisms that could permit significant
    changes to payment. For example, PPACA establishes the Center
    for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test innovative payment
    and service delivery models to reduce program expenditures
    through the use of demonstration programs that can waive
    existing reimbursement methodologies. The Health Reform Laws
    also provide additional Medicaid funding to allow states to
    carry out mandated expansion of Medicaid coverage to certain
    financially-eligible individuals beginning in 2014, and also
    permits states to expand their Medicaid coverage to these
    individuals as early as April 1, 2010, if certain
    conditions are met.

Additionally, although the Health Reform Laws delayed until at
    least October 1, 2011, the implementation of the Resource
    Utilization Group, Version Four (“RUG-IV”), which
    revises the payment classification system for skilled nursing
    facilities, the recently enacted Medicare and Medicaid Extenders
    Act of 2010 repealed this delay retroactively to October 1,
    2010. The Health Reform Laws also extend certain payment rules
    related to long-term acute care hospitals found in the Medicare,
    Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007.

Finally, many other changes resulting from the Health Reform
    Laws, or implementing regulations, or guidance may negatively
    impact our operators and tenants. We will continue to monitor
    and evaluate the Health Reform Laws and implementing regulations
    and guidance to determine other potential effects of the reform.

Impact of Fraud and Abuse Provisions.

The
    Health Reform Laws revise health care fraud and abuse provisions
    that will affect our operators and tenants. Specifically, PPACA
    allows for up to treble damages under the Federal False Claims
    Act for violations related to state-based health insurance
    exchanges authorized by the Health



Reform Laws, which will be implemented beginning in 2014. The
    Health Reform Laws also impose new civil monetary penalties for
    false statements or actions that lead to delayed inspections,
    with penalties of up to $15,000 per day for failure to grant
    timely access and up to $50,000 for a knowing violation. The
    Health Reform laws also provide for additional funding to
    investigate and prosecute health care fraud and abuse.
    Accordingly, the increased penalties under PPACA for fraud and
    abuse violations may have a negative impact on our operators and
    tenants in the event that the government brings an enforcement
    action or subjects them to penalties.

Further, as recently as February 2, 2011, CMS published
    final rulemaking to implement the enhanced provider and supplier
    screening provisions called for in the Health Reform Laws. Under
    the final rule, beginning March 25, 2011, all
    enrolling and participating providers and suppliers will be
    assessed an annual administrative fee and be placed in one of
    three risk levels (limited, moderate, and high) based on an
    assessment of the individual’s or entity’s overall
    risk of fraud, waste and abuse. This rule also allows for the
    temporary suspension of Medicare payments to providers or
    suppliers in the event CMS receives credible information that an
    overpayment, fraud, or willful misrepresentation has occurred.
    The Health Reform Laws granted the Secretary of the Department
    of Health and Human Services significant discretionary authority
    to suspend, exclude, or impose fines on providers and suppliers
    based on the agency’s determination that such a provider or
    supplier is “high-risk,” and, as a result, this final
    rulemaking has the potential to materially adversely affect our
    operators and tenants who may be evaluated under the enhanced
    screening process.

Additionally, provisions of Title VI of PPACA are designed
    to increase transparency and program integrity by skilled
    nursing facilities, other nursing facilities and similar
    providers. Specifically, skilled nursing facilities and other
    providers and suppliers will be required to institute compliance
    and ethics programs. Additionally, PPACA makes it easier for
    consumers to file complaints against nursing homes by mandating
    that states establish complaint websites. The provisions calling
    for enhanced transparency will increase the administrative
    burden and costs on these providers.

Impact to the Health Care Plans Offered to Our
    Employees.

The Health Reform Laws will affect
    employers that provide health plans to their employees. The new
    laws will change the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D
    retiree drug subsidy and extend dependent coverage for
    dependents up to age 26, among other changes. We are
    evaluating our health care plans in light of these changes.
    These changes may affect our operators and tenants as well.

Medicare
    Program Reimbursement Changes

In recent months, CMS released a number of rulemakings that may
    potentially increase or decrease the government reimbursement of
    our operators and tenants. To the extent that any of these
    rulemakings decrease government reimbursement to our operators
    and tenants, our revenue and operations may be indirectly,
    adversely affected.

On August 16, 2010, CMS issued a final rule updating the
    long-term acute care hospital prospective payment system for
    fiscal year 2011. Among other things, the final rule updates
    payment rates for acute care and long-term care hospitals and
    implements certain provisions of the Health Reform Laws. In the
    rule, CMS finalized an update of 2.5% for inflation with a cut
    of 0.5% as required by the Health Reform Laws and a negative
    2.5% documentation and coding adjustment for long-term care
    hospitals. CMS also released a notice and comment rulemaking for
    the prospective payment system and consolidated billing for
    skilled nursing facilities for fiscal year 2011 on July 22,
    2010. CMS adjusts the nursing home payment rates for fiscal year
    2011 by including a market basket increase factor of 2.3% and a
    negative 0.6 percentage point forecast error adjustment,
    which would result in a net increase update of 1.7% for nursing
    home rates.

CMS annually adjusts the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule payment
    rates based on an update formula that includes application of
    the Sustainable Growth Rate (“SGR”). On
    November 29, 2010, CMS published the calendar year 2011
    Physician Fee Schedule final rule. Among other things, CMS
    preliminary estimates in the final rule that the calendar year
    2011 SGR formula will be negative 13.4%. This measure is a
    significant change from the figure provided in the proposed
    rule, and will replace the 21.3% reduction in physician Medicare
    reimbursement in 2010 required by the SGR formula. Additionally,
    in the final rule, CMS has eliminated certain CPT consultation
    codes, which could negatively impact the reimbursement levels
    received by our operators and tenants.



Finally, on November 24, 2010, CMS published the calendar
    year 2011 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System
    (“OPPS”) final rule. CMS estimates that the cumulative
    effect of all changes to payment rates for calendar year 2011
    will have a positive effect, resulting in a 2.5% estimated
    increase in Medicare payments to providers paid under the HOPPS.

Economic
    Outlook

The serious economic recession affecting the national and global
    economy has continued to impact all sectors, including, to a
    somewhat lesser degree, health care. Continuing mixed economic
    signals have made it difficult to predict when there might be a
    return to more normal and stable growth rates, employment levels
    and overall economic performance.

Banks have remained cautious in their lending, but significant
    liquidity has been injected into the senior housing and care
    markets by various Government-Sponsored Enterprises. In
    addition, there is significant equity investment capital
    available for certain health care sectors, particularly medical
    office buildings. This has had the effect of keeping
    capitalization rates in these segments generally in line with or
    even below historic rates. Debt costs for REITs have generally
    declined over the past 12 months, and equity markets for
    health care REITs have remained open for the most part.

As a consequence, while liquidity remained an important
    consideration in 2010, we have been more aggressive in pursuing
    attractive investment opportunities that meet our strategic and
    underwriting criteria. We have also been more active in
    accessing capital markets during this time. We believe the
    markets in which we invest will continue to offer stable returns
    during the economic downturn and significant growth potential as
    and when the economy begins to rebound.

Business
    Strategy

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and
    enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash
    dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase
    dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual
    increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To
    meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of
    senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our
    investment portfolio by property type, customer and geographic
    location.

Substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from
    operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest
    earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent
    our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are
    dependent upon our obligors’ continued ability to make
    contractual rent and interest payments to us. To the extent that
    our obligors experience operating difficulties and are unable to
    generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be
    a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our
    investments through a variety of methods determined by the type
    of property and operator/tenant. Our asset management process
    includes review of monthly financial statements for each
    property, periodic review of obligor credit, periodic property
    inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to
    licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other
    collateral. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a
    proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific
    data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain
    industry trends and risks. Through these asset management and
    research efforts, we are typically able to intervene at an early
    stage to address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the
    collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.

In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we
    also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk.
    Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by
    guaranties

and/or

letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically
    structured as master leases and loans are generally
    cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans,
    operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and
    its affiliates.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, rental income and
    interest income represented 86% and 6% respectively, of total
    gross revenues (including revenues from discontinued
    operations). Substantially all of our operating leases are
    designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent
    structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial
    lease period, subject to a



collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with
    contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the
    contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield
    on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including
    the stated interest rate, the average principal amount
    outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate
    adjustments.

Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we
    believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations, meet
    debt service obligations (both principal and interest), make
    dividend distributions and complete construction projects in
    process. We also anticipate evaluating opportunities to finance
    future investments. New investments are generally funded from
    temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from
    sales of real property. Our investments generate cash from rent
    and interest receipts and principal payments on loans
    receivable. Permanent capital for future investments, which
    replaces funds drawn under the unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, has historically been provided through a
    combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity
    securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new
    investments will be available in the future with spreads over
    our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to
    our stockholders. We expect to complete gross new investments of
    approximately $1.5 billion in 2011, comprised of
    acquisitions/joint ventures totaling $1.3 billion and
    funded new development of $212 million. We anticipate the
    sale of real property and the repayment of loans receivable
    totaling $300 million during 2011. It is possible that
    additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur
    in the future. To the extent that loan repayments and real
    property sales exceed new investments, our revenues and cash
    flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to
    reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property
    sales in new investments. To the extent that new investment
    requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to
    borrow under our unsecured line of credit arrangement. At
    December 31, 2010, we had $131,570,000 of cash and cash
    equivalents, $79,069,000 of restricted cash and $850,000,000 of
    available borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement.

Key
    Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties

We utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the
    various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed
    below and relate to operating performance, concentration risk
    and credit strength. Management uses these key performance
    indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to
    our historical operating results, in making operating decisions
    and for budget planning purposes.

Operating Performance.

We believe that net
    income attributable to common stockholders (“NICS”) is
    the most appropriate earnings measure. Other useful supplemental
    measures of our operating performance include funds from
    operations (“FFO”) and net operating income
    (“NOI”); however, these supplemental measures are not
    defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“U.S. GAAP”). Please refer to the section
    entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for
    further discussion and reconciliations of FFO and NOI. These
    earnings measures and their relative per share amounts are
    widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation,
    comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The
    following table reflects the recent historical trends of our
    operating performance measures for the periods presented (in
    thousands, except per share data):

Credit Strength.

We measure our credit
    strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios.
    Our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization and debt
    to market capitalization. The leverage ratios indicate how much
    of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term
    debt. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service
    interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal
    amortization and preferred dividends). We expect to maintain
    capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain
    compliance with our debt covenants. The coverage ratios are
    based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) which is
    discussed in further detail, and reconciled to net income, below
    in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Leverage ratios
    and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and
    rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment
    recommendations and rating of companies. The following table
    reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength
    measures for the periods presented:

Concentration Risk.

We evaluate our
    concentration risk in terms of asset mix, investment mix,
    customer mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a
    valuable measure in understanding what portion of our
    investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to
    experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our
    investments that are real property. In order to qualify as an
    equity REIT, at least 75% of our real estate investments must be
    real property whereby each property, which includes the land,
    buildings, improvements, intangibles and related rights, is
    owned by us and leased to a tenant pursuant to a long-term
    operating lease. Investment mix measures the portion of our
    investments that relate to our various property types. Customer
    mix measures the portion of our investments that



relate to our top five customers. Geographic mix measures the
    portion of our investments that relate to our top five states.

    concentration risk for the periods presented:

We evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with
    current expectations to determine if historical trends are
    indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be
    achieved and actual results may differ materially from our
    expectations. Factors that may cause actual results to differ
    from expected results are described in more detail in
    “Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors” and
    other sections of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Management regularly monitors economic and other factors to
    develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve
    performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability
    to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our
    ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately
    respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends. Please
    refer to “Business,” “Risk Factors” and
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion
    of these risk factors.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Sources
    and Uses of Cash

Our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts,
    resident fees and services, borrowings under the unsecured line
    of credit arrangement, public and private offerings of debt and
    equity securities, proceeds from the sales of real property and
    principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash
    include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including
    principal and interest), real property investments (including
    construction advances), loan advances, property operating
    expenses and general and administrative expenses. These sources
    and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of
    Cash Flows and are discussed in further detail below.

Gross straight-line rental income represents the non-cash
    difference between contractual cash rent due and the average
    rent recognized pursuant to U.S. GAAP for leases with fixed
    rental escalators, net of collectability reserves. This amount
    is positive in the first half of a lease term (but declining
    every year due to annual increases in cash rent due) and is
    negative in the second half of a lease term. The fluctuation in
    cash receipts due to real property sales is attributable to less
    significant straight-line rent receivable balances on properties
    sold during the current year. The fluctuation in prepaid rent
    receipts is primarily due to changes in prepaid rent received at
    certain construction projects.



Investing Activities.

The changes in net cash
    used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net

The contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures primarily
    represent $174,692,000 and $21,321,000 of cash invested by us in
    the joint ventures with Forest City Enterprises and a national
    medical office building company, respectively. Please see
    Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for
    additional information.

Financing Activities.

The changes in net cash
    provided from or used in financing activities are primarily
    attributable to changes related to our long-term debt
    arrangements, proceeds from the issuance of common stock and
    dividend payments.

The changes in our senior unsecured notes are due to
    (i) the issuance of $494,403,000 of convertible senior
    unsecured notes in March and June 2010; (ii) the repurchase
    of $441,326,000 of convertible senior unsecured notes in March
    and June 2010; (iii) the issuance of $450,000,000 of senior
    unsecured notes in April and June 2010; (iv) the issuance
    of $450,000,000 of senior unsecured notes in September 2010;
    (v) the issuance of $450,000,000 of senior unsecured notes
    in November 2010; (vi) the extinguishment of $183,147,000
    of various senior unsecured notes in March and September 2009;
    and (vii) the extinguishment of $42,330,000 of
    7.625% senior unsecured notes in March 2008. We recognized
    losses of $25,072,000 and $19,269,000 during the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in connection
    with the aforementioned extinguishments.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we extinguished 35
    secured debt loans totaling $194,493,000 with a weighted-average
    interest rate of 6.07% and recognized extinguishment losses of
    $9,099,000. Also during the year ended December 31, 2010,
    we issued $81,977,000 of secured debt loans at an average
    interest rate of 5.10%. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, we extinguished 20 secured debt loans totaling $81,715,000
    with a weighted-average interest rate of 7.21% and recognized
    extinguishment losses of $5,838,000. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we extinguished eight secured debt loans
    totaling $50,475,000 with a weighted-average interest rate of
    6.67% and recognized extinguishment gains of $2,094,000.

We may repurchase, redeem or refinance convertible and
    non-convertible senior unsecured notes from time to time, taking
    advantage of favorable market conditions when available. We may
    purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases,
    privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some
    cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant
    to their terms. The non-convertible senior unsecured notes are
    redeemable at



our option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part,
    at a redemption price equal to the sum of (1) the principal
    amount of the notes (or portion of such notes) being redeemed
    plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to the redemption
    date and (2) any “make-whole” amount due under
    the terms of the notes in connection with early redemptions. We
    cannot redeem the 3.00% convertible senior unsecured notes due
    2029 prior to December 1, 2014 unless such redemption is
    necessary to preserve our status as a REIT. However, on or after
    December 1, 2014, we may from time to time at our option
    redeem those notes, in whole or in part, for cash, at a
    redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
    notes we redeem, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but
    excluding, the redemption date. Redemptions and repurchases of
    debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our
    liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other
    factors.

In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (including
    100% of capital gains) to our stockholders. The increase in
    dividends is primarily attributable to an increase in our common
    shares outstanding. The following is a summary of our dividend

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we entered into a
    joint venture investment with Forest City Enterprises
    (NYSE:FCE.A and FCE.B). The portfolio is 100% leased and
    includes affiliates of investment grade pharmaceutical and
    research tenants such as Novartis, Genzyme, Millennium (a
    subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceuticals), and Brigham and
    Women’s Hospital. Forest City Enterprises self-developed
    the portfolio and will continue to manage it on behalf of the
    joint venture. The life science campus is part of a mixed-use
    project that includes a 210-room hotel, 674 residential units, a
    grocery store, restaurants and retail. In connection with this
    transaction, we invested $174,692,000 of cash which is recorded
    as an equity investment on the balance sheet. Our share of the
    non-recourse secured debt assumed by the joint venture was
    approximately $156,729,000 with weighted-average interest rates
    of 7.1%. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we
    entered into a joint venture investment with a national medical
    office building company. In connection with this transaction, we
    invested $21,321,000 of cash which is recorded as an equity
    investment on the balance sheet. Our share of the non-recourse
    secured debt assumed by the joint venture was approximately
    $24,609,000 with weighted-average interest rates of 6.06%.
    Please see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements
    for additional information.

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may or
    may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge
    interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on
    the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates, our
    perception of the future volatility of interest rates and our
    relative levels of variable rate debt and variable rate
    investments. Please see Note 11 to our consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

At December 31, 2010, we had five outstanding letter of
    credit obligations totaling $5,482,932 and expiring between 2011
    and 2013. Please see Note 12 to our consolidated financial
    statements for additional information.

Amounts represent principal amounts
    due and do not reflect unamortized premiums/discounts or other
    fair value adjustments as reflected on the balance sheet.

At December 31, 2010, we had an unsecured line of credit
    arrangement with a consortium of sixteen banks in the amount of
    $1.15 billion, which is scheduled to expire on
    August 6, 2012. Borrowings under the agreement are subject
    to interest payable in periods no longer than three months at
    either the agent bank’s prime rate of interest or the
    applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate, at our option (0.87%
    at December 31, 2010). The applicable margin is based on
    certain of our debt ratings and was 0.6% at December 31,
    2010. In addition, we pay a facility fee annually to each bank
    based on the bank’s commitment amount. The facility fee
    depends on certain of our debt ratings and was 0.15% at
    December 31, 2010. We also pay an annual agent’s fee
    of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the agreement.
    At December 31, 2010, we had $300,000,000 outstanding under
    the unsecured line of credit arrangement and estimated
    contractual interest obligations of $4,133,000. Contractual
    interest obligations are



estimated based on the assumption that the balance of
    $300,000,000 at December 31, 2010 is constant until
    maturity at interest rates in effect at December 31, 2010.

We have $3,064,930,000 of senior unsecured notes principal
    outstanding with fixed annual interest rates ranging from 3.00%
    to 8.00%, payable semi-annually. Total contractual interest
    obligations on senior unsecured notes totaled $1,391,673,000 at
    December 31, 2010. A total of $788,077,000 of our senior
    unsecured notes are convertible notes that also contain put
    features. Please see Note 10 to our consolidated financial
    statements for additional information.

Additionally, we have secured debt with total outstanding
    principal of $1,133,715,000, collateralized by owned properties,
    with annual interest rates ranging from 3.01% to 8.74%, payable
    monthly. The carrying values of the properties securing the debt
    totaled $2,054,820,000 at December 31, 2010. Total
    contractual interest obligations on secured debt totaled
    $436,955,000 at December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2010, we had operating lease obligations of
    $230,189,000 relating primarily to ground leases at certain of
    our properties and office space leases.

Purchase obligations are comprised of unfunded construction
    commitments and contingent purchase obligations. At
    December 31, 2010, we had outstanding construction
    financings of $356,793,000 for leased properties and were
    committed to providing additional financing of approximately
    $268,055,000 to complete construction. At December 31,
    2010, we had contingent purchase obligations totaling
    $33,613,000. These contingent purchase obligations relate to
    unfunded capital improvement obligations. Upon funding, amounts
    due from the tenant are increased to reflect the additional
    investment in the property.

Other long-term liabilities relate to our Supplemental Executive
    Retirement Plan (“SERP”) and certain non-compete
    agreements. We have a SERP, a non-qualified defined benefit
    pension plan, which provides certain executive officers with
    supplemental deferred retirement benefits. The SERP provides an
    opportunity for participants to receive retirement benefits that
    cannot be paid under our tax-qualified plans because of the
    restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended. Benefits are based on compensation and length
    of service and the SERP is unfunded. We expect to contribute
    $1,500,000 to the SERP during the 2011 fiscal year. Benefit
    payments are expected to total $2,367,000 during the next five
    fiscal years and $2,410,000 thereafter. We use a December 31
    measurement date for the SERP. The accrued liability on our
    balance sheet for the SERP was $4,066,000 and $3,287,000 at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

In connection with the Windrose merger, we entered into a
    consulting agreement with Frederick L. Farrar, which expired in
    December 2008. We entered into a new consulting agreement with
    Mr. Farrar in December 2008, which expired in December
    2009. Mr. Farrar agreed not to compete with us for a period
    of two years following the expiration of the agreement. In
    exchange for complying with the covenant not to compete,
    Mr. Farrar receives eight quarterly payments of $37,500,
    with the first payment to be made on the date of expiration of
    the agreement. The first payment to Mr. Farrar was made in
    January 2010 and the final payment will be made in September
    2011.

Capital
    Structure

As of December 31, 2010, we had total equity of
    $4,733,100,000 and a total outstanding debt balance of
    $4,460,855,000, which represents a debt to total book
    capitalization ratio of 49%. Our ratio of debt to market
    capitalization was 38% at December 31, 2010. For the year
    ended December 31, 2010, our adjusted interest coverage
    ratio was 3.39x and our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio was
    2.76x. Also, at December 31, 2010, we had $131,570,000 of
    cash and cash equivalents, $79,069,000 of restricted cash and
    $850,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured
    line of credit arrangement.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
    events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain
    certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose
    certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create
    liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of
    December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all of the
    covenants under our debt agreements. Please refer to the section
    entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for
    further discussion. None of our debt agreements contain
    provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt
    ratings. However, under our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used
    to determine the fees and interest charged.



We plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our
    debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our
    current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook
    by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material
    adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which
    could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    results of operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition.

On May 7, 2009, we filed an open-ended automatic or
    “universal” shelf registration statement with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission covering an indeterminate
    amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock,
    preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units. As of
    January 31, 2011, we had an effective registration
    statement on file in connection with our enhanced dividend
    reinvestment plan under which we may issue up to
    10,000,000 shares of common stock. As of January 31,
    2011, 8,397,408 shares of common stock remained available
    for issuance under this registration statement. We have entered
    into separate Equity Distribution Agreements with each of UBS
    Securities LLC, RBS Securities Inc., KeyBanc Capital Markets
    Inc. and Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. relating to the
    offer and sale from time to time of up to $250,000,000 aggregate
    amount of our common stock (“Equity Shelf Program”).
    As of January 31, 2011, we had $119,985,000 of remaining
    capacity under the Equity Shelf Program. Depending upon market
    conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our
    registration statements to invest in additional properties and
    to repay borrowings under our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement.

The increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the
    acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly
    constructed senior housing and care properties from which we
    receive rent. Certain of our leases contain annual rental
    escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer
    Price Index

and/or

changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s
    properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line
    rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If
    gross operating revenues at our facilities

and/or

the
    Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues
    may not continue to increase. Sales of real property would
    offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new
    acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues. Our leases
    could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an
    increase or decrease in rental income.

As discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial
    statements, we completed two senior housing operating
    partnerships in 2010. The results of operations for these
    partnerships have been included in our consolidated results of
    operations from the dates of acquisition and represent the sole
    component of resident fees and services, property operating
    expenses and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests
    for this segment.



Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 represents $22,905,000, $12,622,000 and
    $7,176,000, respectively, of secured debt interest expense
    offset by interest allocated to discontinued operations. The
    change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect
    and timing of assumptions, extinguishments and principal
    amortizations. The following is a summary of our senior housing
    and care property secured debt principal activity (dollars in
    thousands):

Depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of
    new property acquisitions and the conversions of newly
    constructed investment properties. To the extent that we acquire
    or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision
    for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.

Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2010
    primarily represent costs incurred with the senior housing
    operating partnerships (including due diligence costs, fees for
    legal and valuation services, and termination of pre-existing
    relationships computed based on the fair value of the assets
    acquired), lease termination fees and costs incurred in
    connection with other new property acquisitions.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 31 senior
    housing and care properties for net gains of $36,274,000 as
    compared to 21 properties for net gains of $32,084,000 in 2009
    and 36 properties for net gains of $151,457,000 in 2008.
    Additionally, at December 31, 2010, we had 16 senior
    housing facilities that satisfied the requirements for held for
    sale treatment. We did not recognize an impairment loss on these
    facilities as the fair value less estimated costs to sell
    exceeded our carrying value. The following illustrates the
    reclassification impact as a result of classifying the
    properties sold prior to or held for sale at December 31,
    2010 as discontinued operations for the periods presented.
    Please refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial
    statements for further discussion.

We recorded $23,261,000 of provision for loan losses during the
    year ended December 31, 2009. This amount includes the
    write-off of loans totaling $25,578,000 primarily relating to
    certain early stage senior housing operators offset by a net
    reduction in the allowance for loan losses of $2,457,000. We
    recorded $29,684,000 of provision for loan losses during the
    year ended December 31, 2010. This amount includes the
    write-off of loans totaling $33,591,000 primarily related to
    certain early stage senior housing and CCRC development
    projects. This was offset by a net reduction of the allowance
    balance by $3,907,000, resulting in an allowance for loan losses
    of $1,276,000 relating to real estate loans with outstanding
    balances of $9,691,000, all of which were on non-accrual status
    at December 31, 2010. The provision for loan losses is
    related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance
    for loan losses and is discussed in “Critical Accounting
    Policies.”

The increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the

    and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions,



could result in decreased revenues. Our leases could renew above
    or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or
    decrease in rental income. Interest income decreased from the
    prior period primarily due to a decline in outstanding balances
    for medical facility real estate loans. Other income is
    attributable to third party management fee income.

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 represents $24,926,000, $20,584,000 and
    $21,828,000, respectively, of secured debt interest expense
    offset by interest allocated to discontinued operations. The
    change in secured debt interest expense is primarily due to the

The increase in property operating expenses and depreciation and
    amortization is primarily attributable to acquisitions and
    construction conversions of new medical facilities for which we
    incur certain property operating expenses offset by property
    operating expenses associated with discontinued operations.

Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2010
    represent costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of
    new properties. Income tax expense is primarily related to third
    party management fee income.

Income from unconsolidated joint ventures represents our share
    of net income related to our joint venture investment with
    Forest City Enterprises. See Note 7 to our consolidated
    financial statements for additional information. The following
    is a summary of our net income from this investment for the year
    ended December 31, 2010 (in thousands):

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold two
    medical facilities for net gains of $12,476,000. At
    December 31, 2008, we had 15 medical facilities that were
    held for sale and we recorded an impairment charge of
    $32,648,000 to reduce the carrying values of certain properties
    to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. During the
    year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 15 medical facilities
    for net gains of $11,310,000. At December 31, 2009, we had
    eight medical facilities held for sale and recorded an
    impairment charge of $25,223,000 to reduce the properties to
    their estimated fair values less costs to sell. In determining
    the fair value of the held for sale properties, we used a
    combination of third party appraisals based on market comparable
    transactions, other market listings and asset quality as well as
    management calculations based on projected operating income and
    published capitalization rates. During the three months ended
    September 30, 2010, we recorded an impairment charge of
    $947,000 related to two of the held for sale medical facilities
    to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair values less
    costs to sell based on current sales price expectations. During
    the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold seven of the held
    for sale medical facilities for net losses of $159,000. At
    December 31, 2010, we had one medical facility held for
    sale. The following illustrates the reclassification impact as a
    result of classifying medical facilities sold prior to or held
    for



sale at December 31, 2010 as discontinued operations for
    the periods presented. Please refer to Note 5 to our
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

We recognized losses of $0,

    extinguishments for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009
    and 2010, respectively.

During the three months ended September 30, 2009, we
    completed a $10,750,000 first mortgage loan secured by a
    commercial real estate campus. The

10-year

debt
    has a fixed interest rate of 6.37%.

The change in interest expense on the unsecured line of credit
    arrangement is due primarily to the net effect and timing of
    draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. The
    following is a summary of our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement (dollars in thousands):

We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used
    to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us.
    The amount capitalized is based upon the balances outstanding
    during the construction period using the rate of interest that
    approximates our cost of financing. Our interest expense is
    reduced by the amount capitalized.

Please see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements
    for a discussion of our interest rate swap agreements and their
    impact on interest expense. Loan expense represents the
    amortization of deferred loan costs incurred in connection with
    the issuance and amendments of debt. Loan expense is consistent
    for all years presented.



During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized a
    realized loss on derivatives of $23,393,000 related to
    forward-starting interest rate swaps that were in place to hedge
    future debt issuances when the timing of those issuances was
    revised.

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of
    consolidated revenues (including revenues from discontinued
    operations) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 were 7.78%, 8.33% and 8.24%, respectively. The change from
    prior year is primarily related to (i) the recognition of
    $2,853,000 of expenses in connection with a performance-based
    stock grant, (ii) the recognition of $1,000,000 for the
    immediate vesting of a stock grant in conjunction with the
    CEO’s new employment agreement, and (iii) additional
    salary and benefits to attract and retain appropriate personnel
    to support our business growth. This was partially offset by
    $3,909,000 of non-recurring expenses recognized during the year
    ended December 31, 2009 in connection with the departure of
    Raymond W. Braun who formerly served as President of the company.

The change in preferred dividends is primarily attributable to
    preferred stock conversions into common stock. The following is

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures

We believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the
    most appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider FFO
    to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating
    performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets
    in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the
    value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as
    evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real
    estate values have historically risen or fallen with market
    conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered
    presentations of operating results for real estate companies
    that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In
    response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment
    Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental
    measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes
    historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by
    NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real
    estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after
    adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

Net operating income (“NOI”) is used to evaluate the
    operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as total
    revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property level
    operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization,
    general and administrative expenses, impairments and interest
    expense. We believe NOI provides investors relevant and useful
    information because it measures the operating performance of our
    properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use
    NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess
    the property level performance of our properties.

EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization. We believe that EBITDA, along with net income
    and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an
    important supplemental measure because it provides additional
    information to assess and evaluate the performance of our
    operations. A covenant in our line of credit arrangement
    contains a financial ratio based on a definition of EBITDA that
    is specific to that agreement. Failure to satisfy this covenant
    could result in an event of default that could have a material
    adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which
    could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
    results of operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition. Due to the materiality of this debt
    agreement and the financial covenant, we have disclosed Adjusted
    EBITDA, which represents EBITDA as defined above and



adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, provision for
    loan losses and gain/loss on extinguishment of debt. We
    primarily utilize Adjusted EBITDA to measure our adjusted
    interest coverage ratio, which represents Adjusted EBITDA
    divided by total interest, and our adjusted fixed charge
    coverage ratio, which represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by
    fixed charges. Fixed charges include total interest, secured
    debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. Our
    covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge ratio of at least
    1.75 times.

Other than Adjusted EBITDA, our supplemental reporting measures
    and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by
    investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the
    valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of
    companies. Management uses these financial measures to
    facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical
    operating results and in making operating decisions.
    Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of
    Directors to evaluate management. Adjusted EBITDA is used solely
    to determine our compliance with a financial covenant of our
    line of credit arrangement and is not being presented for use by
    investors for any other purpose. None of our supplemental
    measures represent net income or cash flow provided from
    operating activities as determined in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative
    measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the
    supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable
    to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate
    investment trusts or other companies.

The tables below reflect the reconciliation of FFO to net income
    attributable to common stockholders, the most directly
    comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented.
    The provisions for depreciation and amortization include
    provisions for depreciation and amortization from discontinued
    operations. Noncontrolling interest amounts represent the
    noncontrolling interests’ share of transaction costs and
    depreciation and amortization. Unconsolidated joint venture
    amounts represent our share of unconsolidated joint
    ventures’ depreciation and amortization. Amounts are in
    thousands except for per share data.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
    with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and
    assumptions. Management considers accounting estimates or
    assumptions critical if:

•

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to
    the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for
    highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters
    to change; and

•

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial
    condition or operating performance is material.



Management has discussed the development and selection of its
    critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
    disclosure presented below relating to them. Management believes
    the current assumptions and other considerations used to
    estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial
    statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to
    change in the future. However, since these estimates require
    assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the
    estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual
    experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations
    used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated
    financial statements, the resulting changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition. Please refer to Note 1 of our audited
    consolidated financial statements for further information on
    significant accounting policies that impact us. There were no
    material changes to these policies in 2010.

The following table presents information about our critical
    accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to
    develop each estimate:

Nature of Critical

Assumptions/

Accounting Estimate

Approach Used

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the
    accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of
    joint ventures in which we own a majority voting interest with
    the ability to control operations and where no substantive
    participating rights or substantive kick out rights have been
    granted to the noncontrolling interests. In addition, we
    consolidate those entities deemed to be variable interest
    entities in which we are determined to be the primary
    beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and balances
    have been eliminated in consolidation.

We make judgments about which entities are VIEs based on an
    assessment of whether (i) the equity investors as a group, if
    any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the
    equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that
    entity’s activities without additional subordinated
    financial support. We make judgments with respect to our level
    of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are
    not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various
    factors includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct
    the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s
    economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our
    representation on the entity’s governing body, the size and
    seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other
    investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the
    manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability
    to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at
    inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when
    determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the
    presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial
    statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a
    date other than at inception of the variable interest entity,
    our assumptions may be different and may result in the
    identification of a different primary beneficiary.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial
    statements, significant management judgment is required to
    evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements.

Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and
    our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense
    recognized. Adjustments to income tax expense may be required as
    a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal and state tax
    authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a REIT, (iii) the
    potential for built-in-gain recognized related to prior-tax-free
    acquisitions of C corporations, and (iv) changes in tax laws.
    Adjustments required in any given period are included in income.

Assumptions/

Accounting Estimate

Approach Used

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review our long-lived assets for potential impairment in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP. An impairment charge must be
    recognized when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not
    recoverable. The carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds
    the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
    the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is
    determined that a permanent impairment of a long-lived asset has
    occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair
    value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference
    between the carrying value and the fair value.

The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment. These indicators may include anticipated operating losses at the property level, the tenant’s inability to make rent payments, a decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and changes in the market that may permanently reduce the value of the property.  If indicators of impairment exist, then the undiscounted future cash flows from the most likely use of the property are compared to the current net book value. This analysis requires us to determine if indicators of impairment exist and to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows to be generated from the property during the period the property is expected to be held.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, an impairment charge of $25,223,000 was recorded to reduce the carrying value of eight medical facilities to their estimated fair value less costs to sell. In det
ermining the fair value of the properties, we used a combination of third party appraisals based on market comparable transactions, other market listings and asset quality as well as management calculations based on projected operating income and published capitalization rates. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 38 properties, including seven of the held for sale medical facilities, for net gains of $36,115,000. At December 31, 2010, we had one medical facility and 16 senior housing facilities that satisfied the requirements for held for sale treatment. During the three months ended September 30, 2010, we recorded an impairment charge of $947,000 related to two of the held for sale medical facilities to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair values less costs to sell based on current sales price expectations.

Allowance for Loan Losses

We maintain an allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S.
    GAAP. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level
    believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans
    receivable. The determination of the allowance is based on a
    quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans. If this
    evaluation indicates that there is a greater risk of loan
    charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual
    status may be required. A loan is impaired when, based on
    current information and events, it is probable that we will be
    unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the
    contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Consistent
    with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed
    impaired. To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of
    collectability is diminished, we will return these loans to full
    accrual status.

The determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments and principal. We evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors and value of the underlying property.

As a result of our quarterly evaluations, we recorded $29,684,000 of provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2010. This amount includes the write-off of loans totaling $33,591,000 primarily related to certain early stage senior housing and CCRC development projects. These related to three separate borrowers where new factors arose that, under the circumstances, resulted in the determination to record the write-offs. This was offset by a net reduction of the allowance balance by $3,907,000, resulting in an allowance for loan losses of $1
,276,000 relating to real estate loans with outstanding balances of $9,691,000, all of which were on non-accrual status at December 31, 2010.



Nature of Critical

Assumptions/

Accounting Estimate

Approach Used

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires
    that revenue be recognized after four basic criteria are met.
    These four criteria include persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and determinable
    income and reasonably assured collectability. If the
    collectability of revenue is determined incorrectly, the amount
    and timing of our reported revenue could be significantly
    affected. Interest income on loans is recognized as earned based
    upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation
    of collectability risk. Substantially all of our operating
    leases contain fixed and/or contingent escalating rent
    structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial
    lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental
    income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is
    generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments
    due for the period. We recognize resident fees and services,
    other than move in fees, monthly as services are provided. Move
    in fees, which are a component of resident fees and services,
    are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
    applicable lease agreement. Lease agreements with residents
    generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the
    resident with 30 days’ notice.

We evaluate the collectability of our revenues and related receivables on an on-going basis. We evaluate collectability based on assumptions and other considerations including, but not limited to, the certainty of payment, payment history, the financial strength of the investment’s underlying operations as measured by cash flows and payment coverages, the value of the underlying collateral and guaranties and current economic conditions.

If our evaluation indicates that collectability is not reasonably assured, we may place an investment on non-accrual or reserve against all or a portion of current income as an offset to revenue.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $40,855,000 of interest income, $51,006,000 of resident fees and services, and $603,410,000 of rental income, including discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash receipts on leases with deferred revenue provisions equaled $8,537,000 as compared to gross straight-line rental income recogni
zed of $14,717,000. At December 31, 2010, our straight-line receivable balance was $86,669,000, net of reserves totaling $265,000. Also at December 31, 2010, we had real estate loans with outstanding balances of $9,691,000 on non-accrual status.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

The valuation of derivative instruments is accounted for in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires companies to record
    derivatives at fair market value on the balance sheet as assets
    or liabilities.

The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
    instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are estimated by
    utilizing pricing models that consider forward yield curves and
    discount rates. Such amounts and their recognition are subject
    to significant estimates which may change in the future. At
    December 31, 2010, we participated in one interest rate swap
    agreement which is reported at its fair value of $482,000 in
    other liabilities.

Business Combinations

Real property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the
    capitalization of construction period interest. The cost of real
    property acquired is allocated to net tangible and identifiable
    intangible assets based on their respective fair values.
    Tangible assets primarily consist of land, buildings and
    improvements. The remaining purchase price is allocated among
    identifiable intangible assets primarily consisting of the above
    or below market component of in-place leases and the value of
    in-place leases. The total amount of other intangible assets
    acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and
    customer relationship values based on management’s
    evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s
    lease and the Company’s overall relationship with that
    respective tenant.

We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize o
ver the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases

We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for improvements. Lives for intangibles are based on the remaining term of the underlying leases.  For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded $144,098,000, $40,147,000 and $18,298,000 as provisions for depreciation and amortization relating to buildings, improvements and intangibles, respectively, including amounts reclassified as discontinued operations. The average useful life of our buildings, improvements and intangibles was 38.2 years, 11.6 years and 6.0 years, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010.



Impact of
    Inflation

During the past three years, inflation has not significantly
    affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate.
    Additionally, our earnings are primarily long-term investments
    with fixed rates of return. These investments are mainly
    financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes
    and borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangement.
    During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by
    rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely
    affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a
    slower rate than new borrowing costs. Presuming the current
    inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do
    not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not
    impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We seek to
    mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by
    matching the terms of new investments with new long-term fixed
    rate borrowings to the extent possible. We may or may not elect
    to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate
    exposure. These decisions are principally based on our policy to
    match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings,
    but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the
    applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of
    interest rates. This section is presented to provide a
    discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations
    in interest rates.

We historically borrow on our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement to acquire, construct or make loans relating to
    health care and senior housing properties. Then, as market
    conditions dictate, we will issue equity or long-term fixed rate
    debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured line of credit
    arrangement.

A change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense
    associated with our fixed rate debt. Interest rate changes,
    however, will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt.
    Changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this
    fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows
    and earnings, depending on whether the debt is replaced with
    other fixed rate debt, variable rate debt or equity or repaid by
    the sale of assets. To illustrate the impact of changes in the
    interest rate markets, we performed a sensitivity analysis on
    our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in
    net present values arising from a hypothetical 1% increase in
    interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair
    value. The following table summarizes the analysis performed as
    of the dates indicated (in thousands):

On December 31, 2010, we assumed an interest rate swap (the
    “December 2010 Swap”) for a total notional amount of
    $12,650,000 to hedge interest payments associated with long-term
    LIBOR based borrowings. The December 2010 Swap has an effective
    date of December 31, 2010 and a maturity date of
    December 31, 2013. The December 2010 Swap has the economic
    effect of fixing $12,650,000 at 5.50% plus a credit spread
    through the swap’s maturity. In January 2011, the December
    2010 Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge and we expect it
    to be highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of
    interest payments on $12,650,000 of long-term debt due to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate.

Our variable rate debt, including our unsecured line of credit
    arrangement, is reflected at fair value. At December 31,
    2010, we had $300,000,000 outstanding related to our variable
    rate line of credit and $103,645,000 outstanding related to our
    variable rate secured debt. Assuming no changes in outstanding
    balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in
    increased annual interest expense of $4,036,000. At
    December 31, 2009, we had $140,000,000 outstanding related
    to our variable rate line of credit and $131,952,000 outstanding
    related to our



variable rate secured debt. Assuming no changes in outstanding
    balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would have resulted in
    increased annual interest expense of $2,720,000.

We are subject to risks associated with debt financing,
    including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be
    refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as
    favorable as the terms of current indebtedness. The majority of
    our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual
    agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.
    Accordingly, in the event that we are unable to raise additional
    equity or borrow money because of these limitations, our ability
    to acquire additional properties may be limited.

For additional information regarding fair values of financial
    instruments, see “Item 7 — Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Critical Accounting Policies” and

HEALTH

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Business

Health Care REIT, Inc., an S&P 500 company with
    headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, is an equity real estate
    investment trust (“REIT”) that invests in senior
    housing and health care real estate. Our full service platform
    also offers property management and development services to our
    customers. As of December 31, 2010, our diversified
    portfolio consisted of 683 properties in 41 states. Founded
    in 1970, we were the first real estate investment trust to
    invest exclusively in health care facilities. More information
    is available on our website at www.hcreit.com.

2.

Accounting
    Policies and Related Matters

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we
    control, through voting rights or other means. All material
    intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

At inception of joint venture transactions, we identify entities
    for which control is achieved through means other than voting
    rights (“variable interest entities” or
    “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the
    primary beneficiary of its operations. A variable interest
    entity is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the
    equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling
    financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk
    is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without
    additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate
    investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary
    beneficiary. ASC 810,

Consolidations

, requires
    enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining
    whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated on a
    continuous basis. This evaluation is based on an
    enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities
    of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact
    that entity’s economic performance.

For investments in joint ventures, we evaluate the type of
    rights held by the limited partner(s), which may preclude
    consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner
    would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership. The
    assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on
    the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the
    sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the
    sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there
    is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights
    of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner
    increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership,
    or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of
    outstanding limited partnership interests. We similarly evaluate
    the rights of managing members of limited liability companies.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which
    requires that revenue be recognized after four basic criteria
    are met. These four criteria include persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and determinable
    income and reasonably assured collectability. Interest income on
    loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount
    outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectability risk.
    Substantially all of our operating leases contain either fixed
    or contingent escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed
    annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a
    collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with
    contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the
    contractual cash rental payments due for the period. We
    recognize resident fees and services, other than move in fees,
    monthly as services are provided. Move in fees, which are a
    component of resident fees and services, are



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
    applicable lease agreement. Lease agreements with residents
    generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the
    resident with 30 days’ notice.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid
    investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash primarily consists of amounts held by lenders to
    provide future payments for real estate taxes, insurance, tenant
    and capital improvements and amounts held in escrow relating to
    acquisitions we are entitled to receive over a period of time as
    outlined in the escrow agreement.

Deferred
    Loan Expenses

Deferred loan expenses are costs incurred by us in connection
    with the issuance, assumption and amendments of debt
    arrangements. We amortize these costs over the term of the debt
    using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective
    interest method.

Equity
    Investments

Equity investments at December 31, 2010 and 2009 include an
    investment in a public company that has a readily determinable
    fair market value. We classify this equity investment as

available-for-sale

and, accordingly, record this investment at its fair market
    value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income, a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. Equity investments at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 also include an investment in a
    private company. We do not have the ability to exercise
    influence over the company, so the investment is accounted for
    under the cost method. Under the cost method of accounting,
    investments in private companies are carried at cost and are
    adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value, return of capital and additional
    investments. These equity investments represented a minimal
    ownership interest in these companies. Additionally, equity
    investments include investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.

Investments
    in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Investments in less than majority owned entities where our
    interests represent a general partnership interest but
    substantive participating rights or substantive kick-out rights
    have been granted to the limited partners, or where our
    interests do not represent the general partnership interest and
    we do not control the major operating and financial policies of
    the entity, are reported under the equity method of accounting.
    Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the
    investee’s earnings or losses is included in our
    consolidated results of operations. To the extent that the
    Company’s cost basis is different from the basis reflected
    at the joint venture level, the basis difference is generally
    amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities,
    and such amortization is included in the Company’s share of
    equity in earnings of the joint venture. The initial carrying
    value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based
    on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the
    estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of
    interests in the joint venture. We evaluate our equity method
    investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the
    estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its
    carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated
    fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is

other-than-temporary,

an impairment is recorded.

Redeemable
    Noncontrolling Interests

Certain noncontrolling interests are redeemable at fair value at
    December 31, 2010. Accordingly, we record the carrying
    amount of the noncontrolling interests at the greater of
    (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

decreased for the noncontrolling interest’s share of net
    income or loss and its share of other comprehensive income or
    loss and dividends or (ii) the redemption value. In
    accordance with ASC 810, the redeemable noncontrolling
    interests were classified outside of permanent equity, as a
    mezzanine item, in the balance sheet.

Real
    Property Owned

Real property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the
    capitalization of construction period interest. The cost of real
    property acquired is allocated to net tangible and identifiable
    intangible assets based on their respective fair values. These
    properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their
    estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40 years for
    buildings and five to 15 years for improvements. Tangible
    assets primarily consist of land, buildings and improvements. We
    consider costs incurred in conjunction with re-leasing
    properties, including tenant improvements and lease commissions,
    to represent the acquisition of productive assets and,
    accordingly, such costs are reflected as investment activities
    in our statement of cash flows.

The remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable
    intangible assets primarily consisting of the above or below
    market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place
    leases. The value allocable to the above or below market
    component of the acquired in-place lease is determined based
    upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the
    risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference
    between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to
    the lease over its remaining term, and
    (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would
    be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the
    lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included
    in acquired lease intangibles and below market leases are
    included in other liabilities in the balance sheet and are
    amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the
    respective leases.

The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further
    allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship
    values based on management’s evaluation of the specific
    characteristics of each tenant’s lease and the
    Company’s overall relationship with that respective tenant.
    Characteristics considered by management in allocating these
    values include the nature and extent of the Company’s
    existing business relationships with the tenant, growth
    prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the
    tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals,
    among other factors. The estimated aggregate amortization
    expense for acquired lease intangibles is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted average period of 18.2 years and
    is as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):

The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on
    a property by property basis to determine if facts and
    circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that
    the depreciable life may need to be changed. We consider
    external factors relating to each asset and the existence of a
    master lease which may link the cash flows of an individual
    asset to a larger portfolio of assets leased to the same tenant.
    If these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of
    the asset over the remaining depreciation period indicate that
    the asset will not be recoverable, the carrying value is reduced
    to the estimated fair market value. In addition, we are exposed
    to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real
    estate, and in particular, the senior housing and health care
    industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could
    adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to
    sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us.



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Capitalization
    of Construction Period Interest

We capitalize interest costs associated with funds used to
    finance the construction of properties owned directly by us. The
    amount capitalized is based upon the balance outstanding during
    the construction period using the rate of interest which
    approximates our cost of financing. We capitalized interest
    costs of $20,792,000, $41,170,000, and $25,029,000 during 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, related to construction of real
    property owned by us. Our interest expense reflected in the
    consolidated statements of income has been reduced by the
    amounts capitalized.

Gain
    on Sale of Assets

We recognize sales of assets only upon the closing of the
    transaction with the purchaser. Payments received from
    purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and
    classified as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    Gains on assets sold are recognized using the full accrual
    method upon closing when (i) the collectability of the
    sales price is reasonably assured, (ii) we are not
    obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to
    earn the profit, (iii) we have received adequate initial
    investment from the buyer and (iv) other profit recognition
    criteria have been satisfied. Gains may be deferred in whole or
    in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain
    recognition on sales of real estate.

Real
    Estate Loans Receivable

Real estate loans receivable consist of mortgage loans and other
    real estate loans. Interest income on loans is recognized as
    earned based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an
    evaluation of collectability risks. The loans are primarily
    collateralized by a first, second or third mortgage lien, a
    leasehold mortgage on, or an assignment of the partnership
    interest in, the related properties, corporate guaranties

and/or

personal guaranties.

Allowance
    for Losses on Loans Receivable

The allowance for losses on loans receivable is maintained at a
    level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans
    receivable. The determination of the allowance is based on a
    quarterly evaluation of these loans, including general economic
    conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We
    evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a
    combination of factors, including, but not limited to,
    delinquency status, historical loan charge-offs, financial
    strength of the borrower and guarantors and value of the
    underlying collateral. If such factors indicate that there is
    greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or
    placement on non-accrual status may be required. A loan is
    impaired when, based on current information and events, it is
    probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as
    scheduled according to the contractual terms of the original
    loan agreement. Consistent with this definition, all loans on
    non-accrual are deemed impaired. At December 31, 2010, we
    had loans with outstanding balances of $9,691,000 on non-accrual
    status ($67,126,000 at December 31, 2009). To the extent
    circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is
    diminished, we will return these loans to full accrual status.
    While a loan is on non-accrual status, any cash receipts are
    applied against the outstanding principal balance.

Goodwill

We account for goodwill in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
    Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for
    impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate
    that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is
    recognized to the extent that the carrying amount, including
    goodwill, exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value and the
    implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount
    of that goodwill.

Fair
    Value of Derivative Instruments

The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
    instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are estimated by
    utilizing pricing models that consider forward



HEALTH

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts and the
    recognition of such amounts are subject to significant estimates
    that may change in the future. See Note 11 for additional
    information.

Federal
    Income Tax

No provision has been made for federal income taxes since we
    have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust
    under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
    and we believe that we have met the requirements for
    qualification as such for each taxable year. Our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income
    taxes. See Note 18 for additional information.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
    of shares outstanding for the period adjusted for non-vested
    shares of restricted stock. The computation of diluted earnings
    per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that
    the number of shares is increased to include the number of
    additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
    potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

New
    Accounting Standards

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) amended the consolidation guidance for
    variable interest entities. The new guidance, to be applied on a
    continuous basis, requires enterprises to perform a qualitative
    approach to determining whether or not a variable interest
    entity will need to be consolidated. This evaluation is based on
    an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the
    activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly
    impact its economic performance. This amendment became effective
    as of January 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did
    not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

In July 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update

No. 2010-20,

Receivables (Topic 310): Disclosures about the Credit Quality of
    Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses
    (“ASU

2010-20”).

This update expands the required disclosures regarding the
    credit quality of our financing receivables, how risk is
    analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit
    losses, and the changes (and reasons for the changes) in the
    allowance for credit losses. Both new and existing disclosures
    must be disaggregated by portfolio segment and class. The
    disaggregation of information is based on the level at which an
    entity develops and documents a systematic method for
    determining its allowance for credit losses. This update is
    effective for interim periods and fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform

Merrill
    Gardens Partnership

During the three months ended September 30, 2010, we
    completed the formation of our partnership with Merrill Gardens
    LLC to own and operate a portfolio of 38 combination senior
    housing and care communities located primarily in West Coast
    markets. We own an 80% partnership interest and Merrill Gardens
    owns the remaining 20% interest and continues to manage the
    communities. The partnership owns and operates 13 communities
    previously owned by us and 25 additional communities previously
    owned by Merrill Gardens.



HEALTH

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The transaction took advantage of the structure authorized by
    the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007
    (“RIDEA”). (See Note 18 for additional discussion
    of RIDEA.) The results of operations for this partnership have
    been included in our consolidated results of operations
    beginning as of September 1, 2010 and are a component of
    our senior housing and care segment. Consolidation is based on a
    combination of ownership interest and control of operational
    decision-making authority.

In conjunction with the formation of the partnership, we
    contributed $254,885,000 of cash and the 13 properties
    previously owned by us, and the partnership assumed the secured
    debt relating to these properties. Merrill Gardens contributed
    the remaining 25 properties to the partnership and the secured
    debt relating to these properties in exchange for their 20%
    interest in the partnership. The 13 properties are recorded at
    their historical carrying values and the noncontrolling interest
    was established based on such values. The difference between the
    fair value of the consideration received relating to these
    properties and the historical allocation of the 20%
    noncontrolling interest was recorded in capital in excess of par
    value. The total purchase price for the 25 communities acquired
    have been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible
    assets and liabilities based upon their respective fair values
    in accordance with the Company’s accounting policies. Such
    allocations have not been finalized as we await final asset
    valuations and, as such, the allocation of the purchase
    consideration included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
    Sheet at December 31, 2010 is preliminary and subject to
    adjustment. The 20% noncontrolling interest relating to the
    acquired 25 properties is also reflected at estimated fair
    value. The weighted average useful life of the acquired
    intangibles was 1.9 years. The following table presents the

Strategic
    Medical Office Partnership

On December 31, 2010, we formed a strategic partnership
    with a national medical office building company
    (“MOBJV”) whereby the partnership invested in 17
    medical office properties. We own a controlling interest in 11
    properties and consolidate them. Consolidation is based on a
    combination of ownership interest and control of

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operational decision-making authority. We do not own a
    controlling interest in six properties and account for them
    under the equity method. Our investment in the strategic
    partnership provides us access to health systems and includes
    development and property management resources. The results of
    operations for this partnership have been included in our
    consolidated results of operations beginning as of
    December 31, 2010 and are a component of our medical
    facilities segment.

In conjunction with the formation of the partnership, we
    contributed $225,173,000 of cash, convertible preferred stock
    valued at $16,667,000, options valued at $2,721,000 and a note
    payable of $8,333,000 with an interest rate of 6%. MOBJV
    contributed the properties to the partnership and the secured
    debt relating to these properties in exchange for their
    ownership interest in the partnership. The partnership contains
    certain contingent consideration arrangements ranging from $0 to
    $35,008,000. Amounts to be paid are contingent upon certain
    occupancy and development project performance thresholds. Of
    this amount, we recognized $19,453,000 as an estimate of
    additional purchase consideration based on the probability
    amounts will be paid by the expiration date of the commitments.
    Of the remaining $15,555,000 that was not recognized,
    $12,500,000 would be required to be settled in the
    Company’s common stock if certain performance thresholds,
    which we did not deem probable, are met. The total purchase
    price for the assets acquired by the partnership has been
    allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and
    liabilities based upon their respective fair values in
    accordance with the Company’s accounting policies. Goodwill
    represents the future development pipeline expected to be
    generated by the principles. Cash flows from this future
    pipeline are expected to come from development activities and
    the ability to perform the management functions at the assets
    after the properties are developed. Such allocations have not
    been finalized as we await final asset valuations and, as such,
    the allocation of the purchase consideration included in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31,
    2010 is preliminary and subject to adjustment. The
    noncontrolling interest relating to the properties is also
    reflected at estimated fair value. The weighted average useful

of $32,648,000 to reduce the carrying values of certain
    properties to their estimated fair values less costs to sell.
    During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 36
    properties for net gains of $43,394,000. At December 31,
    2009, we had two skilled nursing facilities and eight medical
    facilities held for sale and recorded an impairment charge of
    $25,223,000 to reduce the medical office buildings to their
    estimated fair values less costs to sell. In determining the
    fair value of the held for sale properties, we used a
    combination of third party appraisals based on market comparable
    transactions, other market listings and asset quality as well as
    management calculations based on projected operating income and
    published capitalization rates. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, we sold 38 properties, including seven
    of the held for sale medical facilities, for net gains of
    $36,115,000. At December 31, 2010, we had one medical
    facility and 16 senior housing facilities that satisfied the
    requirements for held for sale treatment and such properties
    were properly recorded at the lesser of their estimated fair
    values less costs to sell or carrying values. During the year
    ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an impairment charge
    of $947,000 related to two of the held for sale medical
    facilities to adjust the carrying values to estimated fair
    values less costs to sell based on current sales price
    expectations. The following is a summary of our real property

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we completed the
    sale of 29 properties to Emeritus Corporation for $299,413,000,
    consisting of $249,413,000 in cash proceeds and $50,000,000 of
    seller financing, and we recognized a gain on sale of
    $145,646,000. Total funds of $299,413,000 were held in escrow
    for use in an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchange,
    of which $162,558,000 was utilized during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. We had retained LandAmerica 1031
    Exchange Services, Inc. (“LES”) to act as a qualified
    intermediary. On November 26, 2008, LES and its parent,
    LandAmerica Financial Group, filed for bankruptcy protection. At
    that time, we had approximately $136,855,000 in two segregated
    escrow accounts (the “Exchange Funds”) held by
    Centennial Bank, an affiliate of LES. Although the terms of our
    agreements with LES required that the Exchange Funds be returned
    to us, the return of the Exchange Funds was stayed by the
    bankruptcy proceedings. On February 23, 2009, the United
    States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia,
    Richmond Division, entered an order approving the stipulation
    and settlement agreement among LES, the unsecured creditors
    committees and us. Pursuant to the terms of that settlement
    agreement, the Exchange Funds plus $918,000 of interest were
    returned to us on February 23, 2009, and we made a
    settlement payment of $2,000,000 to the LES bankruptcy estate.

    recorded as reductions of gains on sales in 2008.

We have reclassified the income and expenses attributable to all

As a result of our quarterly evaluations, we recorded
    $29,684,000 of provision for loan losses during the year ended
    December 31, 2010. This amount includes the write-off of
    loans totaling $33,591,000 primarily related to certain early
    stage senior housing and CCRC development projects. These
    related to three separate borrowers where new factors arose
    that, under the circumstances, resulted in the determination to
    record the write-offs. This was offset by a net reduction of the
    allowance balance by $3,907,000, resulting in an allowance for
    loan losses of $1,276,000 relating to real estate loans with
    outstanding balances of $9,691,000, all of which were on
    non-accrual status at December 31, 2010.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, we received
    title to a parcel of land and an equity interest in satisfaction
    of certain loans outstanding with a combined balance of
    $38,848,000. For balance sheet purposes, the land parcel is
    recorded as land and the equity interest is accounted for as an
    equity method investment (in our senior housing and care
    segment), the amounts of which were recorded at their estimated
    fair values at the transaction dates. The equity interest is in
    an entity deemed to be a VIE, however, we have determined that
    we are not the primary beneficiary as we do not have the ability
    to direct and influence the activities that most significantly
    impact the entity’s economic performance. Our exposure to
    loss is limited to the recorded equity investment balance of
    $29,578,000.

Investments
    in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

During the six months ended June 30, 2010, we entered into
    a joint venture investment with Forest City Enterprises
    (NYSE:FCE.A and FCE.B). We acquired a 49% interest in a
    seven-building life science campus located in University Park in
    Cambridge, MA, which is immediately adjacent to the campus of
    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Six buildings closed
    on February 22, 2010 and the seventh closed on
    June 30, 2010. The portfolio is 100% leased.

In connection with these transactions, we invested $174,692,000
    of cash which is recorded as an equity investment on the balance
    sheet. Our share of the non-recourse secured debt assumed by the
    joint venture was approximately $156,729,000 with
    weighted-average interest rates of 7.1%. The results of
    operations for these properties have been included in our
    consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition
    by the joint venture and are reflected in our income statement
    as income from unconsolidated joint ventures. The aggregate
    remaining unamortized basis difference of our investment in this
    joint venture of $15,141,000 at December 31, 2010 is
    primarily attributable to real estate and related intangible
    assets and will be amortized over the life of the related
    properties and included in the reported amount of income from
    unconsolidated joint ventures.

In addition, on December 31, 2010, we entered into a
    strategic joint venture relationship with a national medical
    office building company. See Note 3 for additional
    information.

Borrowings
    Under Line of Credit Arrangement and Related Items

At December 31, 2010, we had an unsecured line of credit
    arrangement with a consortium of sixteen banks in the amount of
    $1,150,000,000, which is scheduled to expire on August 6,
    2012. Borrowings under the agreement are subject to interest
    payable in periods no longer than three months at either the
    agent bank’s prime rate of interest or the applicable
    margin over LIBOR interest rate, at our option (0.87% at
    December 31, 2010). The applicable margin is based on
    certain of our debt ratings and was 0.6% at December 31,
    2010. In addition, we pay a facility fee annually to each bank
    based on the bank’s commitment amount. The facility fee
    depends on certain of our debt ratings and was 0.15% at
    December 31, 2010. We also pay an annual agent’s fee
    of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the agreement.

Senior
    Unsecured Notes and Secured Debt

We have $3,034,949,000 of senior unsecured notes with annual
    stated interest rates ranging from 3.00% to 8.00%. The carrying
    amounts of the senior unsecured notes represent the par value of
    $3,064,930,000 adjusted for any unamortized premiums or
    discounts and other basis adjustments related to hedging the
    debt with derivative instruments. See Note 11 for further
    discussion regarding derivative instruments.

During the three months ended December 31, 2006, we issued
    $345,000,000 of 4.75% senior unsecured convertible notes
    due December 2026, generating net proceeds of $337,517,000. The
    notes are convertible, in certain circumstances, into cash and,
    if applicable, shares of common stock at an initial conversion
    rate of 20.8833 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
    notes, which represents an initial conversion price of
    approximately $47.89 per share. In general, upon conversion, the
    holder of each note would receive, in respect of the conversion
    value of such note, cash up to the principal amount of such note
    and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess
    of such principal amount. In addition, on each of
    December 1, 2011, December 1, 2016 and
    December 1, 2021, holders may require us to purchase all or
    a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
    100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus
    any accrued and unpaid interest. During the three months ended
    March 31, 2009, we extinguished $5,000,000 of these notes
    and recognized a gain of $446,000. During the six months ended
    June 30, 2010, we extinguished $214,412,000 of these notes,
    recognized a loss of $8,837,000 and paid $18,552,000 to
    reacquire the equity component of convertible debt. As of
    December 31, 2010, we had $125,588,000 of these notes
    outstanding.

In July 2007, we issued $400,000,000 of 4.75% senior
    unsecured convertible notes due July 2027, generating net
    proceeds of $388,943,000. The notes are convertible, in certain
    circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, shares of our
    common stock at an initial conversion rate of
    20.0000 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which
    represents an initial conversion price of approximately $50.00
    per share. In general, upon conversion, the holder of each note
    would receive, in respect of the conversion value of such note,
    cash up to the principal amount of such note and common stock
    for the note’s conversion value in excess of such principal
    amount. In addition, on each of July 15, 2012,
    July 15, 2017 and July 15, 2022, holders may require
    us to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase

    2010, we extinguished $226,914,000 of these notes, recognized a
    loss of $16,235,000 and paid $21,062,000 to reacquire the equity
    component of convertible debt. As of December 31, 2010, we
    had $168,086,000 of these notes outstanding.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we issued
    $494,403,000 of 3.00% senior unsecured convertible notes
    due December 2029, generating net proceeds of $486,084,000. The
    notes are convertible, in certain circumstances, into cash and,
    if applicable, shares of common stock at an initial conversion
    rate of 19.5064 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
    notes, which represents an initial conversion price of
    approximately $51.27 per share. In general, upon conversion, the
    holder of each note would receive, in respect of the conversion
    value of such note, cash up to the principal amount of such note
    and common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess
    of such principal amount. In addition, on each of

    a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
    100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus
    any accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with this
    issuance, we recognized $29,925,000 of equity component of
    convertible debt.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we extinguished
    $183,147,000 of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average
    interest rate of 7.82% and recognized losses of $19,269,000.
    During the three months ended June 30, 2010, we issued
    $450,000,000 of 6.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020 with
    net proceeds of $446,328,000. During the three months ended
    September 30, 2010, we issued $450,000,000 of
    4.70% senior unsecured notes due 2017 with net proceeds of
    $445,768,000. During the three months ended December 31,
    2010, we issued $450,000,000 of 4.95% senior unsecured
    notes due 2021 with net proceeds of $443,502,000.

We have secured debt totaling $1,125,906,000, collateralized by
    owned properties, with annual interest rates ranging from 3.01%
    to 8.74%. The carrying amounts of the secured debt represent the
    par value of $1,133,715,000 adjusted for any unamortized fair
    value adjustments. The carrying values of the properties
    securing the debt totaled $2,054,820,000 at December 31,
    2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we issued
    $157,156,000 of first mortgage loans principal with a rate of
    5.45% secured by 15 properties. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, we assumed $564,657,000 of first
    mortgage loans principal with an average rate of 6.06% secured
    by 60 properties. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    we extinguished $194,493,000 of first mortgage loans principal
    with an average rate of 6.07% and recognized a loss of
    $9,099,000. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we
    extinguished 20 secured debt loans totaling $81,715,000 with a
    weighted-average interest rate of 7.21% and recognized
    extinguishment losses of $5,838,000. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we extinguished eight secured debt loans
    totaling $50,475,000 with a weighted-average interest rate of
    6.67% and recognized extinguishment gains of $2,094,000.

We adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) topic for Accounting for Convertible Debt
    Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion
    (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (“Convertible Debt
    Guidance”), effective January 1, 2009. It provides
    guidance on accounting for convertible debt that may be settled
    in cash upon conversion. It requires bifurcation of the
    convertible debt instrument into a debt component and an equity
    component. The value of the debt component is based upon the
    estimated fair value of a similar debt instrument without the
    conversion feature. The difference between the contractual
    principal on the debt and the value allocated to the debt is
    recorded as an equity component and represents the conversion
    feature of the instrument. The excess of the contractual
    principal amount of the debt over its estimated fair value is
    amortized to interest expense using the effective interest
    method over the period used to estimate the fair value.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
    events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain
    certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose
    certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create
    liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of
    December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all of the
    covenants under our debt agreements.

Derivative
    Instruments

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may
    elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest
    rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on our
    policy to manage the general trend in interest rates at the
    applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of
    interest rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value on the
    balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The valuation of
    derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and
    judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair
    values of our derivatives are estimated by pricing models that
    consider the forward yield curves and discount rates. Such
    amounts and the recognition of such amounts are subject to
    significant estimates that may change in the future.

Cash
    Flow Hedges

For instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow
    hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
    derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive
    income (“OCI”), and reclassified into earnings in the
    same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction
    affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative
    representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components
    excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in
    earnings. Approximately $1,643,000 of losses, which are included
    in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”),
    are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next
    12 months.

On August 7, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap
    (the “August 2009 Swap”) for a total notional amount
    of $52,198,000 to hedge seven years of interest payments
    associated with long-term LIBOR based borrowings. This swap was
    terminated on September 30, 2010 for a cash payment of
    $6,645,000 which has been deferred and included as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income. The effective portion
    is being amortized over the remaining term of the original swap
    as an adjustment to the yield on our LIBOR-based debt. The
    August 2009 Swap had an effective date of August 12, 2009
    and a maturity date of September 1, 2016. The August 2009
    Swap had the economic effect of fixing $52,198,000 at 3.93% plus
    a credit spread for seven years. The August 2009 Swap had been
    designated as a cash flow hedge and we expected it to be highly
    effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest
    payments on $52,198,000 of long-term debt due to changes in the
    LIBOR swap rate.

On September 28, 2009, we entered into an interest rate
    swap (the “September 2009 Swap”) for a total notional
    amount of $48,155,000 to hedge seven years of interest payments
    associated with long-term LIBOR based borrowings. This swap was
    terminated on September 30, 2010 for a cash payment of
    $4,365,000 which has been deferred and included as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income. The effective portion
    is being amortized over the remaining term of the original swap
    as an adjustment to the yield on our LIBOR-based debt. The
    September 2009 Swap had an effective date of September 30,
    2009 and a maturity date of October 1, 2016. The September
    2009 Swap had the economic effect of fixing $48,155,000 at
    3.2675% plus a credit spread for seven years. The September 2009
    Swap had been designated as a cash flow hedge and we expected it
    to be highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of
    interest payments on $48,155,000 of long-term debt due to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate.

On December 31, 2010, we assumed an interest rate swap (the
    “December 2010 Swap”) for a total notional amount of
    $12,650,000 to hedge interest payments associated with long-term
    LIBOR based borrowings. The December 2010 Swap has an effective
    date of December 31, 2010 and a maturity date of
    December 31, 2013. The December 2010 Swap has the economic
    effect of fixing $12,650,000 at 5.50% plus a credit spread
    through the swap’s maturity. In January 2011, the December
    2010 Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge and we expect it
    to be highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of
    interest payments on $12,650,000 of long-term debt due to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized a
    realized loss on derivatives of $23,393,000 related to
    forward-starting interest rate swaps that were in place to hedge
    future debt issuances when the timing of those issuances was
    revised.

Fair
    Value Hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated as a fair value
    hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the
    offsetting loss or gain on the hedged risk are recognized in
    current earnings. There were no outstanding fair value hedges at
    December 31, 2010 or December 31, 2009.

We have two outstanding letters of credit issued for the benefit
    of certain insurance companies that provide workers’
    compensation insurance to one of our tenants. Our obligation to
    provide the letters of credit terminates in 2013. At
    December 31, 2010, our obligation under the letters of
    credit was $4,200,000.

We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit
    of certain insurance companies that provide liability and
    property insurance to one of our tenants. Our obligation to
    provide the letter of credit terminates in 2013. At
    December 31, 2010, our obligation under the letter of
    credit was $1,000,000.

We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit
    of a city in Wisconsin that secures the completion and
    installation of certain public improvements by one of our
    tenants in connection with the development of a property. Our
    obligation to provide the letter of credit terminates in October
    2013. At December 31, 2010, we had an obligation to provide
    a letter of credit in the amount of $215,000.

We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit
    of a village in Illinois that secures the completion,
    installation and maintenance of certain public improvements by
    one of our partnerships in connection with the development of a
    property. Our obligation to provide the letter of credit
    terminates in August 2011. At December 31, 2010, our
    obligation under the letter of credit was $67,932.

At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding construction in
    process of $356,793,000 for leased properties and were committed
    to providing additional funds of approximately $268,055,000 to
    complete construction. At December 31, 2010, we had
    contingent purchase obligations totaling $33,613,000. These
    contingent purchase obligations relate to unfunded capital
    improvement obligations. Rents due from the tenant are increased
    to reflect the additional investment in the property.

We evaluate our leases for operating versus capital lease
    treatment in accordance with ASC Topic 840 “Leases.” A
    lease is classified as a capital lease if it provides for
    transfer of ownership of the leased asset at the end of the
    lease term, contains a bargain purchase option, has a lease term
    greater than 75% of the economic life of the leased asset, or if
    the net present value of the future minimum lease payments are
    in excess of 90% of the fair value of the leased asset. One
    lease related to a senior housing facility contains a bargain
    purchase option and has been classified as a capital lease. At
    December 31, 2010, we had operating lease obligations of
    $230,189,000 relating to certain ground leases and company
    office space. We incurred rental expense relating to company
    office space of $1,280,000, $1,138,000 and $1,452,000 for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Regarding the ground leases, we have sublease agreements with
    certain of our operators that require the operators to reimburse
    us for our monthly operating lease obligations. At
    December 31, 2010, aggregate future minimum rentals to be
    received under these noncancelable subleases totaled $32,329,000.

Stock
    Incentive Plans

Our Amended and Restated 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan
    authorizes up to 6,200,000 shares of common stock to be
    issued at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the
    Board of Directors. The 2005 Plan replaced the 1995 Stock
    Incentive Plan and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors.
    The options granted to officers and key employees under the 1995
    Plan continue to vest through 2010 and expire ten years from the
    date of grant. Our non-employee directors, officers and key
    employees are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. The 2005
    Plan allows for the issuance of, among other things, stock
    options, restricted stock, deferred stock units and dividend
    equivalent rights. Vesting periods for options, deferred stock
    units and restricted shares generally range from three years for
    non-employee directors to five years for officers and key
    employees. Options expire ten years from the date of grant.

Certain options granted to

    value of options with DERs also includes the net present value
    of projected future dividend payments over the expected life of
    the option discounted at the dividend yield rate.

The dividend yield represented the dividend yield of our common
    stock on the dates of grant. Our computation of expected
    volatility was based on historical volatility. The risk-free
    interest rates used were the

7-year

U.S. Treasury Notes yield on the date of grant. The
    expected life was based on historical experience of similar
    awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting
    schedules and expectations regarding future employee behavior.

The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference
    between the exercise price of the underlying options and the
    quoted price of our common stock for the options that were

in-the-money

at December 31, 2010. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the aggregate intrinsic
    value of options exercised under our stock incentive plans was
    $1,798,000, $737,000 and $2,042,000, respectively (determined as
    of the date of option exercise). Cash received from option
    exercises under our stock incentive plans was $4,022,000,
    $3,676,000 and $3,547,000 for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, there was approximately $2,935,000
    of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested
    stock options granted under our stock incentive plans. That cost
    is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    four years. As of December 31, 2010, there was
    approximately $8,010,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested restricted stock granted under our stock
    incentive plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of three years.

We adopted the fair value-based method of accounting for
    share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the
    prospective method. Currently, we use the Black-Scholes-Merton
    option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option
    grants and expect to continue to use this acceptable option
    valuation model. We recognize compensation cost for share-based
    grants on a straight-line basis through the date the awards
    become fully vested or to the retirement eligible date, if
    sooner. Compensation cost totaled $11,823,000, $9,633,000 and
    $8,530,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and

Disclosure
    about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it
    is practicable to estimate that value.

Mortgage Loans and Other Real Estate Loans
    Receivable

— The fair value of mortgage loans and
    other real estate loans receivable is generally estimated by
    discounting the estimated future cash flows using the current
    rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with
    similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The carrying amount
    approximates fair value.

Available-for-sale

Equity Investments

—

Available-for-sale

equity investments are recorded at their fair value based on
    publicly available trading prices.

Borrowings Under Unsecured Lines of Credit
    Arrangements

— The carrying amount of the
    unsecured line of credit arrangement approximates fair value
    because the borrowings are interest rate adjustable.

Senior Unsecured Notes

— The fair value of the
    senior unsecured notes payable was estimated based on publicly
    available trading prices.



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Secured Debt

— The fair value of fixed rate
    secured debt is estimated by discounting the estimated future
    cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would
    be made with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining
    maturities. The carrying amount of variable rate secured debt
    approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate
    adjustable.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

— Interest rate
    swap agreements are recorded as assets or liabilities on the
    balance sheet at fair market value. Fair market value is
    estimated by utilizing pricing models that consider forward
    yield curves and discount rates.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial

U.S. GAAP provides authoritative guidance for measuring and
    disclosing fair value measurements of assets and liabilities.
    The guidance for financial assets and liabilities was previously
    adopted as the standard for those assets and liabilities as of
    January 1, 2008. Additional guidance for non-financial
    assets and liabilities is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008, and was adopted as the standard
    for those assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009. The
    impact of adoption was not significant. The guidance defines
    fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
    principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
    in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value
    hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value. The guidance describes three levels
    of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Interest rate swap agreements are valued
    using models that assume a hypothetical transaction to sell the
    asset or transfer the liability in the principal market for the
    asset or liability based on market data derived from interest
    rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals,
    volatilities, prepayment timing, loss severities, credit risks
    and default rates.

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Items Measured
    at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The market approach is utilized to measure fair value for our
    financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a
    recurring basis. The market approach uses prices and other
    relevant information generated by market transactions involving
    identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

Items Measured
    at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

In addition to items that are measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis, we also have assets and liabilities in our
    balance sheet that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
    basis. As these assets and liabilities are not measured at fair
    value on a recurring basis, they are not included in the tables
    above. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on
    a nonrecurring basis include assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed in business combinations (see Note 3) and
    asset impairments (see Note 5 for impairments of real
    property and Note 6 for impairments of loans receivable).
    We have determined that the fair value measurements included in
    each of these assets and liabilities rely primarily on
    Company-specific inputs and our assumptions about the use of the
    assets and settlement of liabilities, as observable inputs are
    not available. As such, we have determined that each of these
    fair value measurements generally reside within Level 3 of
    the fair value hierarchy. We estimate the fair value of real
    estate using unobservable data such as net operating income and
    estimated capitalization and discount rates. We also consider
    local and national industry market data including comparable
    sales, and commonly engage an external real estate appraiser to
    assist us in our estimation of fair value.

17.

Segment
    Reporting

We invest in senior housing and health care real estate. We
    evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our two
    business segments — senior housing and care and
    medical facilities. Our primary senior housing and care
    properties include skilled nursing facilities, assisted living
    facilities, independent living/continuing care retirement
    communities and combinations thereof. Under the senior housing
    and care segment, we invest in senior housing and health care
    real estate through acquisition and financing of primarily
    single tenant properties. Excluding our senior housing operating
    partnerships (please see Note 3 for additional
    information), properties acquired are primarily leased under

triple-net

leases and we are not involved in the management of the
    property. Our primary medical facility properties include
    medical office buildings, hospitals and life science buildings.
    Our medical office buildings are typically leased to multiple
    tenants and generally require a certain level of property
    management. Our hospital investments are structured similar to
    our senior housing and care investments. Our life science
    investments represent investments in an unconsolidated joint
    venture (see Note 7 for additional information). The
    accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in the summary of significant accounting policies (in
    Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements).
    There are no intersegment sales or transfers. We evaluate
    performance based upon net operating income of the combined
    properties in each segment. Non-segment revenue consists mainly
    of interest income on non-real estate investments and other
    income. Non-segment assets consist of corporate assets including
    cash, deferred loan expenses and corporate offices and

equipment among others. Non-property specific revenues and
    expenses are not allocated to individual segments in determining
    net operating income.

Net operating income
    (“NOI”) is used to evaluate the operating performance
    of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including
    tenant reimbursements, less property level operating expenses,
    which exclude depreciation and amortization, general and
    administrative expenses, impairments and interest expense. We
    believe NOI provides investors relevant and useful information
    because it measures the operating performance of our properties
    at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to
    make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the
    property level performance of our properties.

Excludes income and expense amounts
    related to our life science buildings held in an unconsolidated
    joint venture. Please see Note 7 for additional information.

Income
    Taxes and Distributions

To qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income
    tax purposes, at least 90% of taxable income (excluding 100% of
    net capital gains) must be distributed to stockholders. Real
    estate investment trusts that do not distribute a certain amount
    of current year taxable income in the current year are also
    subject to a 4% federal excise tax. The main differences between
    undistributed net income for federal income tax purposes and
    financial statement purposes are the recognition of
    straight-line rent for reporting purposes, differing useful
    lives and depreciation and amortization methods for real
    property and the provision for loan losses for reporting
    purposes versus bad debt expense for tax purposes.

At December 31, 2010, we had U.S. federal tax losses
    from our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) of
    $19,812,000, as well as apportioned state tax losses of
    $17,137,000 available for carryforward. Valuation allowances
    have been established for these assets based upon our
    assessment, as it is more likely than not that such assets may
    not be realized. The U.S. federal and state tax loss
    carryforwards expire from 2011 through 2030.

Tax expense reflected in the financial statements represents
    state and local income taxes.

As a result of certain acquisitions, we are subject to corporate
    level taxes for related asset dispositions for the period
    December 30, 2010 through December 30, 2020
    (“built-in gains tax”). The amount of income
    potentially subject to this special corporate level tax is
    generally equal to (a) the excess of the fair value of the
    asset as of December 31, 2010 over its adjusted tax basis
    as of December 31, 2010, or (b) the actual amount of
    gain, whichever of (a) and (b) is lower. Some but not
    all gains recognized during this period of time could be offset
    by available net operating losses and capital loss
    carryforwards. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability as
    a result of the potential built-in gains tax based on our
    intentions with respect to such properties and available tax
    planning strategies.

Under the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification and
    Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”), for taxable years
    beginning after July 30, 2008, the REIT may lease
    “qualified health care properties” on an
    arm’s-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the
    property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person
    who qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor.”
    Generally, the rent received from the TRS will meet the related
    party rent exception and will be treated as “rents from
    real property.” A “qualified health care
    property” includes real property and any personal property
    that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a
    hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate
    care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other
    licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary
    services to patients.

We entered into two joint ventures in 2010 that were structured
    under RIDEA. Resident level rents and related operating expenses
    for these facilities are reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and are subject to federal taxes as the operations of
    such facilities are included in a TRS. Certain net operating
    loss carryforwards could be utilized to offset taxable income in
    future years.

19.

Retirement
    Arrangements

Under the retirement plan and trust (the “401(k)
    Plan”), eligible employees may make contributions, and we
    may make matching contributions and a profit sharing
    contribution. Our contributions to the 401(k) Plan totaled
    $1,341,000, $1,201,000 and $1,013,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

We have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”), a non-qualified defined benefit pension
    plan, which provides one executive officer with supplemental
    deferred retirement benefits. The SERP provides an opportunity
    for participants to receive retirement benefits that cannot be
    paid under our tax-qualified plans because of the restrictions
    imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended. Benefits are based on compensation and length of
    service and the SERP is unfunded. We expect to contribute
    $1,500,000 to the SERP



HEALTH

during the 2011 fiscal year. Benefit payments are expected to
    total $2,367,000 during the next five fiscal years and
    $2,410,000 thereafter. We use a December 31 measurement date for
    the SERP. The accrued liability on our balance sheet for the
    SERP was $4,066,000 at December 31, 2010 ($3,287,000 at

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the
    end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
    evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective as of the end of the period covered by this
    report.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
    or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010 based on the criteria established by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    in a report entitled Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework. The scope of management’s assessment as of
    December 31, 2010 did not include an assessment of the
    internal control over financial reporting for the senior housing
    operating partnerships or the strategic medical office
    partnership, as discussed in Note 3 to the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, because they were acquired in
    business combinations during the year ended December 31,
    2010. The acquired businesses represent 15% of total assets at
    December 31, 2010 and 7% and −2% of revenues and net
    income, respectively, for the year then ended. The scope of
    management’s assessment on internal control over financial
    reporting for fiscal 2011 will include the aforementioned
    acquired operations.

Based on this assessment, using the criteria above, management
    concluded that the Company’s system of internal control
    over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
    2010.

The independent registered public accounting firm of
    Ernst & Young LLP, as auditors of the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation
    report on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) occurred
    during the fourth quarter of the one-year period covered by this
    report that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited Health Care REIT, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Health Care REIT,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Management
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s
    assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting did not include the internal
    controls of the Merrill Gardens Partnership, the Senior Star
    Partnership or the Strategic Medical Office Partnership, which
    are included in the 2010 consolidated financial statements of
    Health Care REIT, Inc. and cumulatively constitute 15% of total
    assets at December 31, 2010 and 7% and −2% of
    revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.
    Our audit of the internal control over financial reporting of
    Health Care REIT, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the
    internal control over financial reporting of the aforementioned
    partnerships because they were acquired in business combinations
    on September 1, 2010, December 30, 2010 and
    December 31, 2010, respectively.

In our opinion, Health Care REIT, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO
    criteria.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Health Care REIT, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, equity, and cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Health
    Care REIT, Inc. and our report dated February 25, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
