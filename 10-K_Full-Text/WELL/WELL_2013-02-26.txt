TABLE OF
CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Health Care REIT, Inc. is a real estate investment
trust (“REIT”) that has been at the forefront of seniors housing and health
care real estate since the company was founded in 1970.  We are an S&P 500
company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio. Our portfolio spans the full spectrum of
seniors housing and health care real estate, including seniors housing
communities, skilled nursing/post-acute facilities, medical office buildings,
inpatient and outpatient medical centers and life science facilities. Our
capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and
property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring,
planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate
assets.  More information is available on the Internet at www.hcreit.com.

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder
capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends
to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to
stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and
portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum
of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment
portfolio by property type, customer and geographic location.

Depending upon the availability and cost of external
capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations, meet debt
service obligations (both principal and interest), make dividend distributions
and complete construction projects in process. We also continuously evaluate
opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally
funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured line of credit
arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment
dispositions. Our investments generate cash from net operating income and
principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future
investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured line of
credit arrangement, has historically been provided through a combination of the
issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption
of secured debt.

References herein to “we,” “us,” “our” or the
“Company” refer to Health Care REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless
specifically noted otherwise.

Portfolio of Properties

Please see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Executive Summary –
Company Overview” for a table that summarizes our portfolio as of December 31,
2012.

Property Types

We invest in seniors housing and health care real estate
and evaluate our business on three reportable segments: seniors housing
triple-net, seniors housing operating, and medical facilities.

For
additional information regarding our segments, please see Note 17 to our
consolidated financial statements.

The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements.

The following is a summary of our various property types.

Seniors Housing Triple-Net

Our seniors
housing triple-net properties include independent living facilities, continuing
care retirement communities, assisted living facilities, Alzheimer’s/dementia
facilities, skilled nursing/post-acute facilities and combinations thereof. We
invest primarily through acquisitions and development. Our properties are
primarily leased to operators under long-term, triple-net master leases. We are
not involved in property management.  Our properties include stand-alone facilities
that provide one level of service, combination facilities that provide multiple
levels of service, and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of
services.

Independent
Living Facilities.

Independent living facilities are
age-restricted, multifamily properties with central dining facilities that
provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping,
linen service, transportation and social and recreational activities.

Continuing
Care Retirement Communities.

Continuing care retirement
communities typically include a combination of detached homes, an independent
living facility, an assisted living facility and/or a skilled nursing facility
on one campus. These communities appeal to residents because there is no need to
relocate when health and medical needs change. Resident payment plans vary, but
can


include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental
fees. Many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in
exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services.

Assisted
Living Facilities

.  Assisted living facilities are state regulated rental
properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities, but
also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require
assistance with activities of daily living, including, but not limited to, management
of medications, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating and eating.

Alzheimer’s/Dementia
Care Facilities.

Certain assisted living facilities may include
state licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with
Alzheimer’s disease and/or other types of dementia.

Skilled
Nursing/Post-Acute Facilities

.  Skilled nursing/post-acute facilities are
licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals
require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are
licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement.  All facilities offer some
level of rehabilitation services.  Some facilities focus on higher acuity
patients and offer rehabilitation units specializing in cardiac, orthopedic,
dialysis, neurological or pulmonary rehabilitation.

Our seniors housing triple-net
segment accounted for 41%, 46% and 60% of total revenues (including
discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.  We lease 177 facilities to Genesis HealthCare, LLC pursuant to a
long-term, triple-net master lease.  In addition to rent, the master lease
requires Genesis to pay all operating costs, utilities, real estate taxes,
insurance, building repairs, maintenance costs and all obligations under the
ground leases.  All obligations under the master lease have been guaranteed by
FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, our
lease with Genesis accounted for approximately 31% of our seniors housing
triple-net segment revenues and 13% of our total revenues.

Seniors
Housing Operating

Our seniors
housing operating properties include the same facility types described in “Item
1 – Business – Property Types – Seniors Housing Triple-Net.”  Properties are
primarily held in consolidated joint venture entities with operating partners. We
utilize the structure proposed in the REIT Investment Diversification Act of
2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure (the provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code authorizing the RIDEA structure were enacted as part
of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008).

Our seniors housing operating
segment accounted for 37%, 32% and 7% of total revenues (including discontinued
operations) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.  We have relationships with eight operators to own and operate 154
facilities (plus 39 facilities in an unconsolidated joint venture).  In each
instance, our partner provides management services to the properties pursuant
to an incentive-based management contract.  We rely on our partners to
effectively and efficiently manage these properties.  Please see Note 21 to our
consolidated financial statements for information regarding our acquisition of
Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. on January 9, 2013.  The following table provides
information about our seniors housing operating concentration for the year
ended December 31, 2012:

Benchmark Senior Living, LLC                                                        32%                                                        12%

Merrill Gardens LLC                                                                           31%                                                        11%

Medical Facilities

Our medical
facilities include medical office buildings, hospitals and life science
facilities.  We typically lease our medical office buildings to multiple
tenants and provide varying levels of property management. Our hospital
investments are typically structured similar to our seniors housing triple-net
investments.  Our life science investment represents an investment in an
unconsolidated joint venture entity (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial
statements).  Our medical facilities segment accounted for 22%, 22% and 32% of
total revenues (including discontinued operations) for the years ended December
31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  No single tenant exceeds 20% of segment
revenues.

Medical
Office Buildings

.  The medical office building portfolio consists of health
care related buildings that generally include physician offices, ambulatory
surgery centers, diagnostic facilities, outpatient services and/or labs. Our
portfolio has a strong affiliation with health systems. Approximately 92% of
our medical office building portfolio is affiliated with health systems by
having buildings on hospital campuses or serving as satellite locations for the
health system and their physicians.

Hospitals

. 
Our hospitals generally include acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation
hospitals, and long-term acute care hospitals. Acute care hospitals provide a
wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including, but not limited to,
surgery,


rehabilitation, therapy and clinical
laboratories. Inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient services for
patients with intensive rehabilitation needs. Long-term acute care hospitals
provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that
require more intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than is available
in most skilled nursing facilities.

Life Science Facilities

. 
The life science portfolio consists of laboratory and office facilities
specifically designed and constructed for use by biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies.  These facilities are located adjacent to The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is a well-established market known
for pharmaceutical and biotechnology research. They are similar to commercial
office buildings with advanced HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning),
electrical and mechanical systems.

Investments

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new
investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of
capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders.  We invest
in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions,
developments and joint venture partnerships. For additional information
regarding acquisition and development activity, please see Note 3 to our
consolidated financial statements.  We diversify our investment portfolio by
property type, customer and geographic location. In determining whether to
invest in a property, we focus on the following: (1) the experience of the
obligor’s/partner’s management team; (2) the historical and projected
financial and operational performance of the property; (3) the credit of
the obligor/partner; (4) the security for any lease or loan; (5) the real
estate attributes of the building and its location; (6) the capital
committed to the property by the obligor/partner; and (7) the operating
fundamentals of the applicable industry. We conduct market research and
analysis for all potential investments. In addition, we review the value of all
properties, the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facility-level
debt to be assumed at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources
of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed at the time of the
acquisition.

We monitor our investments through a variety of methods
determined by the type of property. Our proactive and comprehensive asset
management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of
monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review
of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of
covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit
and other collateral. Our internal property management division actively
manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive
process including tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health
service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance,
capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. In
monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect
and analyze property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research
to ascertain industry trends.

We evaluate the operating environment in each
property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the
facility.  When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate
or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we are generally able to intervene
at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both
the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.

Investment Types

Real Property.

Our
properties are primarily comprised of land, building, improvements and related
rights.  Our hospitals and seniors housing triple-net properties are generally
leased to operators under long-term operating leases.  The leases generally
have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more
five to 15-year renewal options. Certain of our leases also contain purchase
options.  Most of our rents are received under triple-net leases requiring the
operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of
the leased property. The tenants are required to repair, rebuild and maintain
the leased properties. Substantially all of these operating leases are designed
with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are
generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period,
subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with
contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual
cash rental payments due for the period.

At December 31, 2012, approximately 91% of our
hospitals and seniors housing triple-net properties were subject to master
leases. A master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity
under a single lease agreement. From time to time, we may acquire additional
properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease. The
tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the
properties that are subject to the master lease. Typically, the master lease
tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master
lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time. This
bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or
renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing
arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties. This spreads our
risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease. The bundling
feature should provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in
bankruptcy. Subject to certain restrictions, a debtor in bankruptcy has the
right to assume or reject each of its leases. It is our intent that a tenant in
bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole,
rather than deciding on a property by property basis.


Our medical office building
portfolio is primarily self-managed and consists principally of multi-tenant
properties leased to health care providers. Our leases have favorable lease terms
that typically include increasers and some form of operating expense
reimbursement by the tenant. As of December 31, 2012, 83% of our portfolio
included leases with full pass through, 15% with a partial expense
reimbursement (modified gross) and 2% with no expense reimbursement (gross).
Our medical office building leases are non-cancellable operating leases that
have a weighted-average remaining term of 8.0 years at December 31, 2012 and
are often credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit.

Construction.

We
occasionally provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of
long-term operating leases. We capitalize certain interest costs associated
with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us. The amount
capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period
using the rate of interest that approximates our company-wide cost of
financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. We also
typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we
defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease. The
construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of
the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period.
During the construction period, we advance funds to the tenants in accordance
with agreed upon terms and conditions which require, among other things,
periodic site visits by a Company representative. During the construction
period, we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of
payment and performance bonds and/or completion guaranties. At December 31,
2012, we had outstanding construction investments of $162,984,000 and were committed
to provide additional funds of approximately $213,255,000 to complete
construction for investment properties.

Real Estate Loans.

Our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us
with interest income, principal amortization and transaction fees and are
generally secured by first/second mortgage liens, leasehold mortgages,
corporate guaranties and/or personal guaranties. At December 31, 2012, we had
outstanding real estate loans of $895,665,000. The interest yield averaged approximately
6.4% per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances. Our yield on real
estate loans depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest
rate, average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any
interest rate adjustments. The real estate loans outstanding at December 31,
2012 are generally subject to one to 15-year terms with principal amortization
schedules and/or balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the
end of the term. Typically, real estate loans are cross-defaulted and
cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or
agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

. 
Our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests
ranging from 10% to 50% in real estate assets.  Investments in less than
majority owned entities where our interests represent a general partnership
interest but substantive participating or kick-out rights have been granted to
the limited partners, or where our interests do not represent the general
partnership interest and we do not control the major operating and financial
policies of the entity, are reported under the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee’s earnings or
losses is included in our consolidated results of operations. To the extent
that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level,
the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related
assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in our share of
equity in earnings of the entity.  The initial carrying value of investments in
unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity
interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of
interests in the entity. Other equity investments include an investment in
available-for-sale securities. These equity investments represented a minimal
ownership interest in these companies. We evaluate our equity method
investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value
of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When we determine a
decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value
is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded.  See Note 7 to our
consolidated financial statements for more information.

Principles
of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we
control, through voting rights or other means. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

At inception of the joint venture transactions, we
identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting
rights (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”) and determine which business
enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations. A VIE is broadly
defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if
any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity
investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without
additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs
when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary.  Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 810,

Consolidations

,

requires enterprises to
perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a VIE will need to
be consolidated on a continuous basis. This evaluation is based on an
enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a VIE that most
significantly impact that entity’s economic performance.

For investments in joint ventures, we evaluate the type
of rights held by the limited partner(s), which may preclude consolidation in
circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the
limited partnership. The assessment of limited


partners’
rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited
partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes
the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change
to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general

partner increases or decreases its ownership
in the limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase or
decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. We
similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies.

Borrowing
Policies

We utilize a combination of debt and equity
to fund investments. Our debt and equity levels are determined by management to
maintain a conservative credit profile. Generally, we intend to issue
unsecured, fixed-rate public debt with long-term maturities to approximate the
maturities on our leases and loans. For short-term purposes, we may borrow on
our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement. We replace these borrowings
with long-term capital such as senior unsecured notes, common stock or
preferred stock. When terms are deemed favorable, we may invest in properties
subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. In addition, we may obtain secured
financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance
properties acquired on a leveraged basis. In our agreements with our lenders,
we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured
indebtedness.

Competition

We compete with
other real estate investment trusts, real estate partnerships, private equity
and hedge fund investors, banks, insurance companies, finance/investment
companies, government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds,
health care operators, developers and other investors in the acquisition,
development, leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing
properties. We compete for investments based on a number of factors including
investment structures, underwriting criteria and reputation. Our ability to
successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends,
availability of acceptable investment opportunities, our ability to negotiate
beneficial investment terms, availability and cost of capital, construction and
renovation costs and new and existing laws and regulations.

The
operators/tenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with
operators/tenants of properties that provide comparable services.
Operators/tenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of
factors including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of
properties, location, services offered, family preferences, physicians, staff
and price. We also face competition from other health care facilities for
tenants, such as physicians and other health care providers that provide
comparable facilities and services.

Certain Government
Regulations

Health
Law Matters — Generally

Typically, operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant
funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws, as
opposed to federal laws. Operators of skilled nursing facilities and hospitals
do receive significant funding from government programs, and these facilities
are subject to the federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of
the medical and/or nursing care provided, ancillary services (

e.g.,

respiratory,
occupational, physical and infusion therapies), qualifications of the
administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant
and equipment, reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies.  In
addition, as described below, operators of these facilities are subject to
extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse,
including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal
Stark Law, and the Federal False Claims Act, as well as comparable state law
counterparts.  Hospitals, physician group practice clinics, and other health
care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal,
state, and local licensure, registration, certification, and inspection laws,
regulations, and industry standards. Our tenants’ failure to comply with any of
these, and other, laws could result in loss of accreditation; denial of
reimbursement; imposition of fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion
from federal and state health care programs; loss of license; or closure of the
facility.

Licensing
and Certification


The primary regulations that affect seniors housing
facilities with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws. In
granting and renewing these licenses, the state regulatory agencies consider
numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations,
including, but not limited to, admission and discharge standards, staffing, and
training. A decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property
owner’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights, medication guidelines,
and rules.  Certain of the seniors housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by
us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee, a portion of
which may be refundable.  These entrance fee communities are subject to
significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of
each facility’s financial condition; establishment and monitoring of reserve
requirements, and other financial restrictions; the right of residents to
cancel their contracts within a specified period of time; lien rights in favor
of residents; restrictions on change of ownership; and similar matters.  Such
oversight, and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities,
may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such
facilities, and, therefore, may adversely affect us.

Certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and
certificate of need (“CON”) laws and regulations.  Where applicable, CON laws
generally require, among other requirements, that a facility demonstrate the
need for (1) constructing a new facility, (2) adding beds or expanding an
existing facility, (3) investing in major capital equipment or adding new
services, (4) changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed
facility, or (5) terminating services that have been previously approved
through the CON process.  Certain state CON laws and regulations may restrict
the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s
size or services. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an
operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a
new operator.  If we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from
participating in a federal or state health care program (as discussed below),
our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s CON
laws, regulations, and applicable guidance governing changes in provider
control.

With respect to licensure, generally our skilled nursing facilities and acute
care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in
Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs.  This generally
requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or bi-annual
basis. The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license
or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct
serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those
operators to discontinue operations at a property.  In addition, if a property
is found to be out of compliance with Medicare, Medicaid, or other health care
program conditions of participation, the property operator may be excluded from
participating in those government health care programs.  Any such occurrence
may impair an operator’s ability to meet their financial obligations to us.  If
we have to replace an excluded-property operator, our ability to replace the
operator may be affected by federal and state laws, regulations, and applicable
guidance governing changes in provider control. This may result in payment
delays, an inability to find a replacement operator, a significant working
capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties.

Reimbursement

Seniors Housing Facilities (excluding skilled nursing facilities).

Approximately 58% of our overall revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2012 were attributable to seniors housing
facilities.  The majority of the revenues received by the operators of these
facilities are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue source is
primarily Medicaid under certain waiver programs. As a part of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) of 1981, Congress established a waiver
program enabling some states to offer Medicaid reimbursement to assisted living
providers as an alternative to institutional long-term care services. The
provisions of OBRA and the subsequent OBRA Acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states
to seek a waiver from typical Medicaid requirements to develop cost-effective
alternatives to long-term care, including Medicaid payments for assisted living
and home health. As of December 31, 2012, ten of our 42 seniors housing
operators received Medicaid reimbursement pursuant to Medicaid waiver programs.
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2012, approximately 4% of the
revenues at our seniors housing facilities were from Medicaid reimbursement.
There can be no guarantee that a state Medicaid program operating pursuant to a
waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status.

Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and are determined
by local market conditions and operating costs. Generally, facilities receive a
higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a Medicaid beneficiary
who requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid reimbursement
varies from state to state.  Thus, the revenues generated by operators of our
assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix, acuity
level, changes in Medicaid eligibility, and reimbursement levels.  In addition,
a state could lose its Medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize
Medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services. Changes in revenues
could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet
its obligations to us.

Skilled Nursing Facilities and Hospitals.

Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals typically receive
most of their revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the
balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors, including
private


insurers.  Consequently, changes in federal or
state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to
cover its expenses, including our rent or debt service. Skilled nursing
facilities and hospitals are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews,
and other audits by federal and state authorities.  A review or audit of a
property operator’s claims could result in recoupments, denials, or delay of
payments in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the
operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us.  Due to the
significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting, no
assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our
property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements, or to
cover settlements made to payors.  In fact, in December 2010, the Department of
Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) released a report
focusing on skilled nursing facilities’ billing practices for Medicare Part A
payments, and found that between 2006-2008 skilled nursing facilities
increasingly billed for higher paying Resource Utilization Groups (“RUGs”), the
payment classification mechanism for the Medicare program, even though
beneficiary characteristics remained largely unchanged.  In particular, from
2006 to 2008, OIG found that the percentage of RUGs for ultra high therapy
increased from 17% to 28%, despite the fact that beneficiaries’ ages and
diagnoses at admission were largely unchanged during that time period. In
November 2012, the OIG released a report focused on inappropriate payments to
skilled nursing facilities, and found that of the 499 claims from 2009 that were
reviewed in the study, skilled nursing facilities billed 25% of the claims in
error and misreported information on the Minimum Data Set (“MDS”) for 47% of
the claims.   Recent attention on skilled nursing billing practices and
payments or ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by government health
care programs, could result in lower payments to skilled nursing facilities
and, as a result, may impair an operator’s ability to meet its financial
obligations to us.

Medicare Reimbursement and Skilled Nursing Facilities.

For the twelve months ended September 30,
2012, approximately 29% of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities
(which comprised 20% of our overall revenues for the year ended December 31,
2012) were paid by Medicare. Skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed
under the Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System (“SNF
PPS”). There is a risk that some skilled nursing facilities’ costs will exceed
the fixed payments under the SNF PPS, and there is also a risk that payments
under the SNF PPS may be set below the costs to provide certain items and
services, which could result in immediate financial difficulties for skilled
nursing facilities, and could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection.
Skilled nursing facilities have faced these types of difficulties since the
implementation of the SNF PPS.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), an agency of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), made a positive
payment update for skilled nursing facilities for fiscal year 2013.  For fiscal
year 2013, skilled nursing facilities received a 1.8% increase in RUG payments,
resulting from a 2.5% market basket update less a 0.7% multi-factor
productivity adjustment . In addition, on November 21, 2011, the Joint Select
Committee on Deficit Reduction, which was created by the Budget Control Act of
2011, concluded its work, and issued a statement that it was not able to make a
bipartisan agreement, thus triggering the sequestration process.  On January 2,
2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012,
which delayed the sequestration process until March 2013.  The sequestration
process, if triggered, will result in spending reductions, including Medicare
cuts.  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also increased the multiple
procedure discount for Part B therapy services from 25% to 50% effective April
2013.

In addition, Section 5008 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 directed
the Secretary of HHS to conduct a Post Acute Care Payment Reform Demonstration
(“PAC-PRD”) program, for a three year period, beginning January 1, 2008,
to assess the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in a
variety of post-acute care settings, including skilled nursing facilities. The
demonstration program’s results and recommendations were reported to Congress
in a January 2012 report.  The results and recommendations could lead to future
changes in Medicare coverage, reimbursement, and reporting requirements for
post-acute care.

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated caps on Medicare reimbursement for
certain therapy services. However, Congress imposed various waivers on the
implementation of those caps.  The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act
of 2012 made a number of changes, including, effective on October 1, 2012,
applying the therapy caps to outpatient hospitals, creating two new threshold
amounts of $3,700 (one for each therapy cap amount), and requiring a manual
medical review process of claims over these new thresholds.  The Middle Class
Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 also extended the waiver program
related to therapy caps through the end of 2012.  These therapy caps may
negatively impact payments to skilled nursing facilities.  However, members of
MedPAC recently stated that they would prefer not to have hard caps, which
indicates that the waiver program for therapy caps will likely continue.

If the waiver program expires, patients will need to use private funds to pay for
the cost of therapy above the caps.  If patients are unable to satisfy their
out-of-pocket cost responsibility to reimburse an operator for services
rendered, the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could
be adversely impacted.

Medicare Reimbursement and Hospitals.

For
the twelve months ended September 30, 2012, approximately 52% of the
revenues at our hospitals (which comprised 5% of our overall revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2012) were from Medicare reimbursements.
Hospitals, generally, are reimbursed by Medicare under the Hospital Inpatient
Prospective Payment System (“PPS”),


the Hospital
Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”), the Long Term Care Hospital
Prospective Payment System (“LTCH PPS”), or the Inpatient Rehabilitation
Facility Prospective Payment System (“IRF PPS”). Acute care hospitals provide a
wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including, but not limited to,
surgery, rehabilitation, therapy, and clinical laboratory services. Long-term
acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with medical
conditions that are often complex and that require more intensive care,
monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing
facilities. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide intensive
rehabilitation services in an inpatient setting for patients requiring at least
three hours of rehabilitation services a day.

With respect to Medicare’s PPS for regular hospitals,
reimbursement for inpatient services is made on the basis of a fixed,
prospective rate, based on the principal diagnosis of the patient.  Hospitals
may be at risk to the extent that their costs in treating a specific case
exceed the fixed payment amount. The diagnosis related group (“DRG”) reimbursement
system was updated in 2008 to expand the number of DRGs from 538 to 745 in
order to better distinguish more severe conditions.   The addition of new DRGs
raised the total number of DRGs to 751.   In some cases, a hospital might be
able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a
threshold.

On August 1, 2012, CMS published a final rule for the
inpatient prospective payment system, which sets forth acute care and long-term
care hospital payment rate changes for the 2013 fiscal year. 
Specifically, CMS estimates that, for fiscal year 2013, the Medicare rates for
inpatient stays at acute care hospitals will increase by 2.8% for those
hospitals that successfully participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality
Reporting Program, while those that do not successfully participate in that
program would receive a payment rate increase of 0.8%.  CMS also implemented a
3.75% one-time budget neutrality adjustment to the long-term care hospital rate
that would be phased in over three years.   The first year phase in of that
adjustment will be 1.3%, which would apply to payments or discharges on or
after December 29, 2012.  CMS adopted a one-year extension of the existing
moratorium on the 25% threshold policy, through fiscal year 2013, beginning on
or after October 1, 2012 and before October 1, 2013.  CMS clarified its
regulations to reflect an existing policy that the Inpatient Prospective
Payment System comparable per diem amount is capped at an amount comparable to
what would have been a full payment under the Inpatient Prospective Payment
System and that cap applies to short stay cases in long-term care hospitals
with discharges occurring on or after December 29, 2012.  The legislative
moratorium on new long-term hospitals and satellite facilities is set to expire
at the end of 2012. Additionally, on July 30, 2012, CMS released notices
updating the payment rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”). 
For IRF discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2012 and on or before September
30, 2013, CMS is implementing a net 1.9% rate increase.

On November 1, 2012, CMS published the calendar
year 2013 final rule with comment period for outpatient care hospitals and
ambulatory surgery centers.  CMS estimates that the rates and policies in the
final rule will increase payment rates for ambulatory surgery centers by 0.6%.

Medicare Reimbursement and Physicians.

CMS annually adjusts the Medicare
Physician Fee Schedule payment rates based on an update formula that includes
application of the Sustainable Growth Rate (“SGR”). On November 1, 2011, CMS
published the calendar year 2012 Physician Fee Schedule final rule for a
negative 27.4% update under the statutory SGR formula.  In February 2012,
Congress passed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, which
blocked the cut through the end of 2012. On November 1, 2012, CMS published the
calendar year 2013 Physician Fee Schedule final rule with comment period.  The
final rule calls for a negative 26.5% update under the statutory SGR formula. 
Congress has overridden the required reduction every year from 2003 through the
end of 2012.  The final rule continues implementation of quality and cost
measures that will be used in establishing a new value−based modifier that
would adjust physician payments based on whether they are providing higher
quality and more efficient care. The Health Reform Laws, as defined below,
require CMS to begin making payment adjustments to certain physicians and
physician groups on January 1, 2015, and to apply the modifier to all
physicians by January 1, 2017. Calendar year 2013 is the initial performance
year for purposes of adjusting payments in calendar year 2015.

Medicaid Reimbursement.

Medicaid is a major payor source for residents
in our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2012, approximately 49% of the revenues of our skilled
nursing facilities and 11% of the revenues of our hospitals were attributable
to Medicaid reimbursement payments. The federal and state governments share
responsibility for financing Medicaid. The federal matching rate, known as the
Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (“FMAP”), varies by state based on
relative per capita income, but is at least 50% in all states. On average,
Medicaid is the largest component of total state spending, representing
approximately 23.7% of total state expenditures  in state fiscal year 2011. The
percentage of Medicaid dollars used for long-term care varies from state to
state, due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility
requirements. Within certain federal guidelines, states have a fairly wide
range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology. 
Many states reimburse long-term care facilities using fixed daily rates, which
are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs
incurred in providing patient care. Reasonable costs typically include
allowances for staffing, administrative and general expenses, property, and
equipment (

e.g.

, real estate taxes, depreciation and fair rental).


In most states, Medicaid
does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services.
Certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid
expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits. Our
skilled nursing portfolio’s average Medicaid rate will likely vary throughout
the year as states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and
Medicaid funding. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if
revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted
expenditures.  President Obama’s proposed fiscal year budget for 2013, released
on February 13, 2012, includes a proposal to place new limits on state provider
taxes that are used to pay the state share of Medicaid and has the potential to
further impact Medicaid reimbursement rates.  The President’s budget includes a
proposal to phase down the Medicaid provider tax, a tax paid by health care
providers to help fund state Medicaid programs, beginning with a reduction from
the current law level of 6.0% to 4.5% in fiscal year 2015.  The President’s
budget also includes a proposal to replace the Federal matching rate for state
Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program with a single matching
rate specific to each state.

The Medicare Part D drug benefit became effective
January 1, 2006. Since that date, low-income Medicare beneficiaries
(eligible for both Medicare and full Medicaid benefits), including those
nursing home residents who are dually eligible for both programs, may enroll
and receive outpatient prescription drugs under Medicare, not Medicaid.
Medicare Part D has resulted in increased administrative responsibilities
for nursing home operators because enrollment in Medicare Part D is
voluntary and residents must choose between multiple prescription drug plans. 
Operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that a
particular drug prescribed to a patient is not listed on the Medicare Part D
drug plan formulary for the plan in which the patient is enrolled.

The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care
facilities continue to evolve.  Federal and state authorities have considered
and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may
negatively impact health care property operations.  The impact of any such
changes, if implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled
nursing and hospital property operations. No assurance can be given that
current revenue sources or levels will be maintained.  Accordingly, there can
be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are
currently, or will be in the future, sufficient to fully reimburse the property
operators for their operating and capital expenses.  As a result, an operator’s
ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted.

Finally,

the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“PPACA”) and the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the PPACA (collectively, the
“Health Reform Laws”) (further discussed below)

may have a significant
impact on Medicare, Medicaid, other federal health care programs, and private
insurers, which impact the reimbursement amounts received by skilled nursing
facilities and other health care providers. The Health Reform Laws could have a
substantial and material adverse effect on all parties directly or indirectly
involved in the health care system.

Other
Related Laws

Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and seniors
housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to federal,
state, and local laws, regulations, and applicable guidance that govern the
operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health
care providers. Certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of
any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients
for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care
programs. Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary
services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each
service. Still, other laws require providers to comply with a variety of
safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed
property and the quality of care provided.  Sanctions for violations of these
laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance may include, but are not
limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate
termination of government payments, and exclusion from any government health
care program. In certain circumstances, violation of these rules (such as those
prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one property may
subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions,
including exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
as well as other government health care programs.  In the ordinary course of
its business, a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries,
investigations, and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these
laws and regulations.

All health care providers, including, but not limited
to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and seniors housing facilities
that receive Medicaid payments) are also subject to the Federal Anti-Kickback
Statute, which generally prohibits persons from offering, providing,
soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an
individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made
under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Skilled
nursing facilities and hospitals are also subject to the Federal Ethics in
Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. The Stark
Law generally prohibits the submission of claims to Medicare for payment if the
claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the
physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that
does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under
the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions on physician self-referrals and submission
of claims apply to state Medicaid programs. Further, health care providers,
including, but not limited to, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and
seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments), are subject to
substantial financial penalties under the Civil


Monetary
Penalties Act and the Federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions
under the Federal False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” provisions. Private
enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments
to the Federal False Claims Act that encourage private individuals to sue on
behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits brought by private
individuals, known as qui tam actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including
present and former patients, nurses and other employees.  Such whistleblower
actions have been brought against nursing facilities on the basis of the
alleged failure of the nursing facility to meet applicable regulations relating
to its operations.  Significantly, if a claim is successfully adjudicated, the
Federal False Claims Act provides for treble damages up to $11,000 per claim.

Prosecutions, investigations, or whistleblower actions
could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity,
financial condition, and operations, which could adversely affect the ability
of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us.  Finally, various
state false claim act and anti-kickback laws may also apply to each property
operator. Violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal
and/or civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability
of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us.

Other legislative developments, including the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), have greatly
expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened
its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government
payors. Congress also has greatly increased funding for the Department of
Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General
of the Department of Health and Human Services to audit, investigate and
prosecute suspected health care fraud.  Moreover, a significant portion of the
billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also
been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation
and prosecution efforts.

Additionally, other HIPAA provisions and regulations
provide for communication of health information through standard electronic
transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information. In
order to comply with the regulations, health care providers often must
undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts. 
Operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain
the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health
information about individuals. The Health Information Technology for Economic
and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act, passed in February 2009, strengthened the
HHS Secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for HIPAA violations
occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH directs the HHS Secretary to
provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business
associates (as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable
HITECH requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will
result in an enforcement action. CMS issued an interim Final Rule which
conformed HIPAA enforcement regulations to the HITECH Act, increasing the
maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition
to $1.5 million.  Higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple
requirements or prohibitions.  Additionally, on January 17, 2013, CMS released
a final rule, which expands the applicability of HIPAA and HITECH and
strengthens the government’s ability to enforce these laws.  The final rule
broadens the definition of “business associate” and provides for civil money
penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts
of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in
place. Additionally, the final rule adopts certain changes to the HIPAA
enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary
penalty structure provided by HITECH, and makes business associates of covered
entities directly liable under HIPAA for compliance with certain of the HIPAA
privacy standards and HIPAA security standards.  HIPAA violations are also
potentially subject to criminal penalties.

In November 2002, CMS began an ongoing national
Nursing Home Quality Initiative (“NHQI”). Under this initiative, historical
survey information, the NHQI Pilot Evaluation Report and the NHQI Overview is
made available to the public on-line. The NHQI website provides consumer and
provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes. The data
allows consumers, providers, states, and researchers to compare quality
information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’
physical and clinical needs. The posted nursing home quality measures come from
resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents
at specified intervals during their stay. If the operators of nursing
facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or
superior to those of their competitors, they may lose market share to other
facilities, reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to
make rental payments.

Finally, government investigations and enforcement
actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically
over the past several years and are expected to continue. Some of these
enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the
application of the Federal False Claims Act. The costs for an operator of a
health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions
and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could
have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its
obligations to us.

Taxation

Federal Income Tax Considerations


The following summary of the taxation of the Company
and the material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and equity
securities is for general information only and is not tax advice. This summary
does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types
of holders of stock or securities (including, but not limited to, insurance
companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging, integrated
conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in
securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities,
investors in pass-through entities and foreign corporations and persons who are
not citizens or residents of the United States).

This summary does not discuss all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular
investment or other circumstances. In addition, this summary does not discuss
any state or local income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax
consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal income tax
law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including
changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied
retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our securities as set forth
in this summary. Before you purchase our securities, you should consult your
own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state, local,
foreign and other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our
securities.

General

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment
trust (a “REIT”) commencing with our first taxable year. We intend to continue
to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT, but there is no guarantee
that we will qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for subsequent years.
Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety
of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to
income, assets, distribution level and diversity of share ownership as
discussed below under “— Qualification as a REIT.” There can be no
assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so
as to qualify or remain qualified.

In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general,
we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT
taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders. We may,
however, be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or
capital gain not distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our
net long-term capital gain, stockholders are required to include their
proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gain in income, but
they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us
on such gain.

Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to
federal income and excise tax as follows:

•     To the extent that we do not distribute all of
our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our
“REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the
undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates;

•     We may be subject to the “alternative minimum
tax” (the “AMT”) on certain tax preference items to the extent that the AMT
exceeds our regular tax;

•     If we have net income from the sale or other
disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business or other non-qualifying income
from foreclosure property, such income will be taxed at the highest corporate
rate;

•     Any net income from prohibited transactions
(which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily
for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than
dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an
involuntary conversion) will be subject to a 100% tax;

•     If we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95%
gross income tests (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our
qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be
subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross income
attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross income over the amount
of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test (discussed
below) or (ii) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross
income for purposes of the 95% gross income test (discussed below) multiplied
by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability;

•     If we fail to distribute during each year at
least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year,
(2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than
capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (3) any
undistributed taxable income from preceding periods, we will be subject to a 4%
excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually
distributed; and


•     We will be subject
to a 100% tax on the amount of any rents from real property, deductions or
excess interest paid to us by any of our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” that would
be reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in
order to more clearly reflect income of the taxable REIT subsidiary. See
“— Qualification as a REIT — Investments in Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries.”

•     We may be subject to the corporate “alternative
minimum tax” on any items of tax preference, including any deductions of net
operating losses.

If we acquire any assets from a corporation, which is
or has been a “C” corporation, in a carryover basis transaction, we could be
liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “C” corporation. A
“C” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay
full corporate level federal income tax. If we recognize gain on the
disposition of the assets during the ten-year period beginning on the date on
which the assets were acquired by us, then, to the extent of the assets’
“built-in gain” (i.e., the excess of the fair market value of the asset over
the adjusted tax basis in the asset, in each case determined as of the
beginning of the ten-year period), we will be subject to tax on the gain at the
highest regular corporate rate applicable. The results described in this
paragraph with respect to the recognition of built-in gain assume that the
built-in gain assets, at the time the built-in gain assets were subject to a
conversion transaction (either where a “C” corporation elected REIT status or a
REIT acquired the assets from a “C” corporation), were not treated as sold to
an unrelated party and gain recognized.  For those properties that are subject
to the built-in-gains tax, if triggered by a sale within the ten-year period
beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us, then the
potential amount of built-in-gains tax will be an additional factor when
considering a possible sale of the properties.  See Note 18 to our consolidated
financial statements for additional information regarding the built-in gains
tax.

Qualification as a REIT

A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or association:

(1)     which is managed by one or more trustees or
directors;

(2)     the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced
by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;

(3)     which would be taxable as a domestic
corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to REITs;

(4)     which is neither a financial institution nor
an insurance company;

(5)     the beneficial ownership of which is held by
100 or more persons in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first
taxable year;

(6)     not more than 50% in value of the outstanding
stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding
its first taxable year, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer
individuals (which includes certain entities) (the “Five or Fewer
Requirement”); and

(7)     which meets certain income and asset tests
described below.

Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met
during the entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at
least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a
proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. For purposes
of conditions (5) and (6), pension funds and certain other tax-exempt
entities are treated as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception in
the case of condition (6).

Based on publicly available information, we believe we
have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in (5) and
(6) above. In addition, Article VI of our by-laws provides for
restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are
intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements
described in (5) and (6) above. These restrictions, however, may not
ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership
requirements described in (5) and (6) above.

We have complied with, and will continue to comply
with, regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders
requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock. If, despite
sending the annual letters, we do not know, or after exercising reasonable
diligence would not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer
Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer Requirement. If
we fail to comply with these regulatory rules, we will be subject to a monetary


penalty. If our failure to comply was due to
intentional disregard of the requirement, the penalty would be increased.
However, if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful
neglect, no penalty would be imposed.

We may own a number of properties through wholly owned
subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified REIT subsidiary” if
100% of its stock is owned by a REIT, and the REIT does not elect to treat the
subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” will not
be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets, liabilities and items of
income, deductions and credits of a “qualified REIT subsidiary” will be treated
as assets, liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT. A “qualified
REIT subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax, and our ownership of the
voting stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions
against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than
10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5% of the
value of our total assets, as described below under “— Asset Tests.”

If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability
company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will
be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s, limited liability
company’s or trust’s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving our
share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited liability company or
trust, and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it
has in the hands of the partnership, limited liability company or trust. These
“look-through” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described
below.

Income Tests.

There
are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that
we must satisfy for each taxable year.

•     At least 75% of our gross income (excluding
gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real
property,” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages
on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments.

•     At least 95% of our gross income (excluding
gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources
qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from dividends (including
dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries) and interest.

As to transactions entered into in taxable years
beginning after October 22, 2004 and on or prior to July 30, 2008, any of
our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into
by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to manage the
risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency fluctuations with
respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us, or such
other risks that are prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is excluded
from the 95% gross income test.

For transactions entered into after July 30,
2008, any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is
entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to
manage the risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency
fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be
incurred by us is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.

For transactions entered into after July 30,
2008, any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered
into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to
any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95% and 75%
gross income tests is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.

In general, a hedging transaction is “clearly
identified” if (1) the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction
before the end of the day on which it is entered into and (2) the items or
risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the
hedging transaction. An identification is not substantially contemporaneous if
it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction.

As to gains and items of income recognized after
July 30, 2008, “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will
not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test and “real
estate foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross
income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Real estate foreign exchange
gain is foreign currency gain (as defined in Internal Revenue Code
Section 988(b)(1)) which is attributable to: (i) any qualifying item
of income or gain for purposes of the 75% gross income test; (ii) the
acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property
or interests in real property; or (iii) becoming or being the obligor
under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real
property. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes Internal Revenue Code
Section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit (a “QBU”) of a
REIT if the QBU itself meets the 75% income test for the taxable year and the
75% asset test at the close of each quarter that the REIT has directly or
indirectly held the QBU. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any
other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.
Passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange


gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to:
(i) any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95% gross
income test; (ii) the acquisition or ownership of obligations;
(iii) becoming or being the obligor under obligations; and (iv) any
other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.

Generally, other than income from “clearly identified”
hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business, any
foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing, or engaging in substantial
and regular trading, in securities will constitute gross income which does not
qualify under the 95% or 75% gross income tests.

Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real
property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a REIT only if
several conditions are met:

•     The amount of rent must not be based in whole or
in part on the income or profits of any person, although rents generally will
not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or
percentages of receipts or sales.

•     Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as
rents from real property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT,
also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant, unless the
tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain other requirements are met
with respect to the real property being rented.

•     If rent attributable to personal property leased
in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total
rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such
personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property.”

•     For rents to qualify as rents from real
property, we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants, other
than through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom
we derive no income, except that we may directly provide services that are
“usually or customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the property
is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only,
or are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant for his convenience.”

•     For taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008,
the REIT may lease

“

qualified
health care

properties”

on an
arm’s-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the property is operated on
behalf of such subsidiary by a person who

qualifies as an
“independent contractor” and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively
engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any
person unrelated to us or our taxable REIT subsidiary, an “

eligible independent contractor

.

”

Generally, the rent that the REIT
receives from the taxable REIT subsidiary will be treated as “rents from real
property.”

A “qualified health care property” includes any real
property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to
the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care
facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility which
extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and which is
operated by a provider of such services which is eligible for participation in
the Medicare program with respect to such facility.

A REIT is permitted to render a de minimis amount of
impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect
to that property as rent from real property. The amount received or accrued by
the REIT during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to
a property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by the REIT
directly or indirectly from the property. The amount received for any service
or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than
150% of the direct cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or
providing the management or operation. Furthermore, impermissible services may
be furnished to tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary subject to certain
conditions, and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property
as rent from real property.

The term “interest” generally does not
include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in
part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount generally will
not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a
fixed percentage of receipts or sales.

If we fail to satisfy one
or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may
nevertheless qualify as a REIT for such year if we are eligible for relief. 
These relief provisions generally will be available if (1) following our
identification of the failure, we file a schedule for such taxable year describing
each item of our gross income, and (2) the failure to meet such tests was
due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.

It is not now possible to
determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of
these relief provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is
imposed on an amount equal to (a) the gross income attributable to
(1) 75% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for
purposes of the 75% income test and (2) 95% of our gross income over the


amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95%
income test, multiplied by (b) a fraction intended to reflect our
profitability.

The Secretary of the
Treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of
income or gain qualify or not under the 75% and 95% gross income tests, or are
to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes.

Asset Tests.

Within 30 days after
the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy several
tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At least 75% of the
value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash
items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation),
government securities and qualified temporary investments. Although the
remaining 25% of our assets generally may be invested without restriction, we
are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10% of either the
vote (the “10% vote test”) or value (the “10% value test”) of the outstanding
securities of any issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT
or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Further, no more than 25% of the total assets may
be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (the “25%
asset test”) and no more than 5% of the value of our total assets may be
represented by securities of any non-governmental issuer other than a qualified
REIT subsidiary (the “5% asset test”), another REIT or a taxable REIT
subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test and the 25% and 5%
asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter. There are special
rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to
changes in the value of the assets of a REIT.

Certain items are excluded
from the 10% value test, including: (1) straight debt securities (as
defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 1361(c)(5)) of an issuer (including
straight debt that provides certain contingent payments); (2) any loan to
an individual or an estate; (3) any rental agreement described in
Section 467 of the Internal Revenue Code, other than with a “related
person”; (4) any obligation to pay rents from real property;
(5) certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof, the
District of Columbia, a foreign government, or any political subdivision
thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; (6) any security issued by a
REIT; and (7) any other arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary
of the Treasury, is excepted from the definition of security (“excluded
securities”). Special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by
corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax
purposes. If a REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds (1) straight
debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and (2) securities of
such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value
greater than 1% of such issuer’s outstanding securities, the straight debt
securities will be included in the 10% value test.

A REIT’s interest as a
partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying
the 10% value test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt
instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of
applying the 10% value test (1) to the extent of the REIT’s interest as a
partner in the partnership and (2) if at least 75% of the partnership’s
gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would
qualify for the 75% gross income test.  For purposes of the 10% value test, a
REIT’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the REIT’s
proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership (other than
the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph).

For taxable years beginning
after July 30, 2008, if the REIT or its QBU uses a foreign currency as its
functional currency, the term “cash” includes such foreign currency, but only
to the extent such foreign currency is (i) held for use in the normal
course of the activities of the REIT or QBU which give rise to items of income
or gain that are included in the 95% and 75% gross income tests or are directly
related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75% asset test, and
(ii) not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and
regular trading in securities.

With respect to corrections of
failures as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test or the 5%
asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a REIT by disposing of
sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1% of
the REIT’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided that
the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter
in which the REIT first identified the assets. For violations of any of the
REIT asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed
the thresholds described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid
disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter by taking
certain steps, including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month
period described above to meet the applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to
the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net
income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period of time that
the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and filing a schedule with the
Internal Revenue Service that describes the non-qualifying assets.

Investments in Taxable
REIT Subsidiaries.

REITs may own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in
taxable REIT subsidiaries. We and any taxable corporate entity in which we own
an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable
REIT subsidiary.”

Certain of our subsidiaries
have elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT
subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their
earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot
be performed directly by REITs without jeopardizing their REIT status. Our
taxable REIT subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes,
but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to
minimize taxes will be successful. To the extent


our
taxable REIT subsidiaries are required to pay federal, state or local taxes,
the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable REIT
subsidiaries will be reduced.

The amount of interest on
related-party debt that a taxable REIT subsidiary may deduct is limited.
Further, a 100% tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable REIT
subsidiary to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate is not
commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT subsidiary is permitted to deduct
interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions.

The Internal Revenue
Service may reallocate costs between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiary
where there is a lack of arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any
deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would
increase its tax liability. Further, any amount by which a REIT understates its
deductions and overstates those of its taxable REIT subsidiary may, subject to
certain exceptions, be subject to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT
subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which
we obtain an interest.

Annual Distribution
Requirements.

In
order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to make
distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders which
qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to
(1) the sum of (i) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without
regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and
(ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property,
minus (2) a portion of certain items of non-cash income. These
distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the
following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for
that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after
such declaration. The amount distributed must not be preferential. This means
that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made
must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class
of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights
as a class. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain
or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,”
as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular
corporate tax rates.  As discussed above, we may be subject to an excise tax if
we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements. We believe we have
satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial REIT
election and each year thereafter through the year ended December 31, 2012.
Although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual
distribution requirements for subsequent years, economic, market, legal, tax or
other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements. See “Item 1A
— Risk Factors.”

It is also possible that,
from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to
meet the 90% distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount as
may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to, among other
things, (1) timing differences between (i) the actual receipt of
income and actual payment of deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of
income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or
(2) the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us. In
the event that timing differences occur, we may find it necessary to arrange
for borrowings or, if possible, pay dividends in the form of taxable stock
dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement.

Under certain
circumstances, in the event of a deficiency determined by the Internal Revenue
Service, we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution
requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a
later year, which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for
the earlier year. Thus, we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts
distributed as deficiency dividends; however, we will be required to pay
applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken
for deficiency dividend distributions.

Failure to Qualify as a REIT

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any
taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any
applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate
rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as
a REIT will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions
be required to be made in any year. All distributions to stockholders will be
taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings
and profits allocable to these distributions and, subject to certain
limitations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for
corporate stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory
provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four
taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not
possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to
statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need
to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially
significant resulting tax liabilities.

In addition to the relief described above under
“— Income Tests” and “— Asset Tests,” relief is available in the
event that we violate a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would
result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due to
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we pay a penalty of
$50,000 for each failure to satisfy the provision; and (3) the violation
does not include a violation described under “— Income Tests” or
“— Asset Tests” above. It is not now possible to determine the
circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
provisions.


Federal Income Taxation
of Holders of Our Stock

Treatment of Taxable U.S. Stockholders.

The following summary applies to you only
if you are a “U.S. stockholder.” A “U.S. stockholder” is a holder of
shares of stock who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is:

•     a citizen or resident of the United State  s;

•     a corporation, partnership or other entity
classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political
subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•     an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•     a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is
able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has
the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions.

So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT,
distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated
earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not designated as
capital gain dividends) will be includable as ordinary income for federal
income tax purposes. None of these distributions will be eligible for the
dividends received deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.

Generally, for taxable years following the year ended
December 31, 2012, the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on
dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of
tax is 20%. Except in limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to
dividends paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not subject
to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital
gains distributed to our stockholders. The reduced maximum federal income tax
rate will apply to that portion, if any, of dividends received by you with
respect to our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received by
us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT subsidiaries; (2) income
from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal
corporate income tax during the prior year (if, for example, we did not
distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or (3) the
amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated
in a non-REIT year.

Distributions that are designated as capital gain
dividends will be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year), without regard to the
period for which you held our stock. However, if you are a corporation, you may
be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary
income.

If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net
long-term capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital gain,
your proportionate share of this net long-term capital gain. You would also
receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by
us on such retained capital gains, and you would have an increase in the basis
of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains
less your share of the tax deemed paid.

You may not include in your federal income tax return
any of our net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules may
also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be
apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution declared by us in October,
November or December of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be
treated as both paid by us and received by you on December 31 of that year,
provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than January 31
of the following year.

We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and
profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be
distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax discussed under
“— General” and “— Qualification as a REIT — Annual Distribution
Requirements” above. As a result, you may be required to treat as taxable
dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a tax-free
return of capital. Moreover, any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a
dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as the case may be),
regardless of our earnings and profits. Any other distributions in excess of
current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the
extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares
of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of
our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced
to zero, after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if
the shares of our stock are held as capital assets. The tax basis as so reduced
will be used in computing the capital gain or loss, if any, realized upon sale
of the shares of our stock. Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our
stock which were held for six months or less (after application of certain
holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term capital loss to
the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to
these shares of our stock.


Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock
to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our
stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us, you will generally
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of
our stock. This gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock
as a capital asset.

If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment
can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of
redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as opposed to dividend
income) equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the
redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such
redemption: (1) results in a “complete termination” of your interest in
all classes of our equity securities; (2) is a “substantially
disproportionate redemption”; or (3) is “not essentially equivalent to a
dividend” with respect to you. In applying these tests, you must take into account
your ownership of all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common stock,
preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must take into
account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by
you.

If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares,
you no longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity
securities or only own (actually and constructively) an insubstantial
percentage of our equity securities, then it is probable that the redemption of
your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and,
thus, would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a distribution is
“not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and
circumstances, and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption,
you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the
particular situation.

Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests
described above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your
shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of
the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits. If the
redemption is taxed as a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed
shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If
you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain circumstances, such basis
may be transferred to a related person, or it may be lost entirely.

Gain from the sale or exchange of our
shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum long-term
capital gain rate of 20% in the case of stockholders who are individuals and
35% in the case of stockholders that are corporations.  Pursuant to Internal
Revenue Service guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain
dividends as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as gain
taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%.  Capital losses
recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more
than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long term capital
losses, and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the
stockholder but not ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may
offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year).

An additional tax
of 3.8% generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of U.S.
stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals, estates or
certain trusts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012.  Among other items, “net investment
income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain
attributable to the disposition of certain property, such as shares of our
common stock or warrants. In the case of individuals, this tax will only apply
to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000
($250,000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses, and
$125,000 for married individuals filing a separate return). U.S. stockholders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this
additional tax in their particular circumstances.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt U.S. Stockholders.

Tax-exempt
entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and
individual retirement accounts (“Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt
from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their
unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The Internal Revenue Service has
issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a REIT to an
exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares
of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the
exempt employee pension trust. Based on this ruling, amounts distributed by us
to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an
Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with
debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the
“debt financed property” rules. Likewise, a portion of the Exempt
Organization’s income from us would constitute UBTI if we held a residual
interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit.

In addition, in certain
circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock is required
to treat a percentage of our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension
trust holding more than 10% of our stock only if: (1) the percentage of
our income that is UBTI (determined as if we were a pension trust) is at least
5%; (2) we qualify as a REIT by reason of the modification of the Five or
Fewer Requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated
as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension
trust; and (3) either (i) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the
value of our stock, or (ii) a group of pension trusts individually holding
more than 10% of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the
value of our stock.


Backup Withholding and
Information Reporting.

Under certain circumstances, you may be subject to backup
withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to, or cash
proceeds of a sale or exchange of, shares of our stock. Backup withholding will
apply only if you: (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your social security
number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are
notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to properly
report payments of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under
penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification
number and that the Internal Revenue Service has not notified you that you are
subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding will not
apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as
corporations and tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax
advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding, and the
procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to
a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund,
provided that the required information is provided to the Internal Revenue
Service. In addition, withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made
to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their
non-foreign status.

Taxation of Foreign
Stockholders.

The
following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person. The federal
taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by
many considerations.

Except as discussed below,
distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the
form of ordinary dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital
assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of
30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the
required form evidencing the lower rate.

In general, you will be
subject to United States federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather
than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such
investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business
in the United States. A corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that
is, or is treated as, effectively connected with a United States trade or
business may also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in
addition to regular United States corporate income tax. The following
discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so
effectively connected. We expect to withhold United States income tax, as
described below, on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless
(1) you file an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI with us claiming
that the distribution is “effectively connected” or (2) certain other
exceptions apply.

Distributions by us that
are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real
property interest will be taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real
Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were gains
“effectively connected” with a United States trade or business. Accordingly,
you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax
and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
individuals. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a branch
profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not
entitled to treaty exemption.

We will be required to withhold from distributions
subject to FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of designated
capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the amount of any distributions
that could be designated as capital gain dividends. In addition, if we
designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent
distributions, up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld
against, will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.

Any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of
stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be
treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more
than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year. Foreign
stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received
from us on U.S. federal income tax returns and all distributions treated
as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any such
capital gain dividends) will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax
(unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as discussed above. In
addition, the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions.

Unless our shares constitute a “United States real property interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively connected with
a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our shares by you generally will not
be subject to United States taxation. Our shares will not constitute a United States real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled REIT.” We
believe that we, and expect to continue to, qualify as a domestically
controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times
during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its shares is held
directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders. However, if you are a
nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for
183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions
apply, you will be subject to a 30% tax on such capital gains. In any event, a
purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under FIRPTA to withhold
on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an
established securities


market or if we are a
domestically controlled REIT. Otherwise, under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be
required to withhold 10% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the
Internal Revenue Service.

Backup withholding tax and information reporting will
generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States that
are treated as: (1) dividends to which the 30% or lower treaty rate
withholding tax discussed above applies; (2) capital gains dividends; or
(3) distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of
U.S. real property interests. Payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock
within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related financial
intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting
unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she
is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge that
the beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or otherwise established an
exemption. You may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal
Revenue Service.

Withholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on certain payments to you or
certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds) and other
non-US persons receiving payments on your behalf, including distributions in
respect of shares of our stock and gross proceeds from the sale of shares of
our stock, if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due
diligence, disclosure and reporting rules, as set forth in recently issued
Treasury regulations. Accordingly, the entity through which shares of our stock
are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required.
Withholding will apply to payments of dividends made after December 31, 2013,
and to payments of gross proceeds from a sale of shares of our stock made after
December 31, 2016.  Stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption
from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding taxes with respect to such dividends
and proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the Internal Revenue
Service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction.  Additional
requirements and conditions may be imposed pursuant to an intergovernmental
agreement, if and when entered into, between the United States and such
institution’s home jurisdiction. We will not pay any additional amounts to any
stockholders in respect of any amounts withheld. You are encouraged to consult
with your tax advisor regarding U.S. withholding taxes and the application of
the recently issued Treasury regulations in light of your particular
circumstances.

U.S. Federal
Income Taxation of Holders of Depositary Shares

Owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if
you were owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary
shares. Thus, you will be required to take into account the income and
deductions to which you would be entitled if you were a holder of the
underlying series of preferred stock.

Conversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred Stock.

No gain or loss will be recognized upon
the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax
basis of each share of preferred stock will, upon exchange, be the same as the
aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged. If you held your
depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of
preferred stock, the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will
include the period during which you owned the depositary shares.

U.S. Federal
Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Debt Securities

The following is a general summary of the United
States federal income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder
that is a non-U.S. holder, as defined below, the United States federal
estate tax consequences, of purchasing, owning and disposing of debt securities
periodically offered under one or more indentures (the “notes”). This summary
assumes that you hold the notes as capital assets. This summary applies to you
only if you are the initial holder of the notes and you acquire the notes for a
price equal to the issue price of the notes. The issue price of the notes is
the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold other than
to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the
capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. In addition, this
summary does not consider any foreign, state, local or other tax laws that may
be applicable to us or a purchaser of the notes.

U.S. Holders

The following summary applies to you only if you are a
  U.S. holder, as defined below.

Definition of a U.S. Holder.

A “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner
of a note or notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes:

•     a citizen or resident of the United States;

•     a corporation, partnership or other entity
classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
organized in or


under the laws of the United States or
of any political subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•     an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•     a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is
able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has
the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions.

Payments of Interest.

Stated interest on the notes generally
will be taxed as ordinary interest income from domestic sources at the time it
is paid or accrues in accordance with your method of accounting for tax
purposes.

Sale,
Exchange or Other Disposition of Notes.

The
adjusted tax basis in your note acquired at a premium will generally be your
cost. You generally will recognize taxable gain or loss when you sell or
otherwise dispose of your notes equal to the difference, if any, between:

•     the amount realized on the sale or other
disposition, less any amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will
be taxable in the manner described under “— Payments of Interest”
above; and

•     your adjusted tax basis in the notes.

Your gain or loss generally will be capital gain or
loss. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if at
the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the notes for more than
one year. Subject to limited exceptions, your capital losses cannot be used to
offset your ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may offset
up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year).

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.

In general, “backup withholding” may apply
to any payments made to you of principal and interest on your note, and to
payment of the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your note before
maturity, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder and: (1) fail to
provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you are an
individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an
incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or
dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you
have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the Internal
Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup
withholding.

The amount of any reportable payments, including
interest, made to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of
tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be reported to you and
to the Internal Revenue Service for each calendar year. You should consult your
tax advisor regarding your qualification for an exemption from backup
withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable.
The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be credited
against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that correct
information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service.

Non-U.S. Holders

The following summary applies to you if you are a
beneficial owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above (a
“non-U.S. holder”).

Special rules may apply to certain
non-U.S. holders such as “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive
foreign investment companies” and “foreign personal holding companies.” Such
entities are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the United States federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to
them.

U.S. Federal
Withholding Tax.

Subject
to the discussion below, U.S. federal withholding tax will not apply to
payments by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as such, of principal and
interest on your notes under the “portfolio interest” exception of the Internal
Revenue Code, provided that:

•     you do not, directly or indirectly, actually or
constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of our stock entitled to vote;

•     you are not (1) a controlled foreign
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related, directly
or indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership, as provided in the
Internal Revenue Code, or (2) a bank receiving interest described in
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code;


•     such interest is not effectively connected with
your conduct of a U.S. trade or business; and

•     you provide a signed written statement, under
penalties of perjury, which can reliably be related to you, certifying that you
are not a U.S. person within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and
providing your name and address to:

•      us or our paying agent; or

•

a securities clearing
organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’
securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds your notes
on your behalf and that certifies to us or our paying agent under penalties of
perjury that it, or the bank or financial institution between it and you, has
received from you your signed, written statement and provides us or our paying
agent with a copy of such statement.

Treasury regulations provide that:

•     if you are a foreign partnership, the
certification requirement will generally apply to your partners, and you will
be required to provide certain information;

•     if you are a foreign trust, the certification
requirement will generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners
depending on whether you are a “foreign complex trust,” “foreign simple trust,”
or “foreign grantor trust” as defined in the Treasury regulations; and

•     look-through rules will apply for tiered
partnerships, foreign simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts.

If you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust,
you should consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these
Treasury regulations and the certification requirements applicable to you.

If you cannot satisfy the portfolio interest
requirements described above, payments of interest will be subject to the 30%
United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a properly executed
(1) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming an exemption from
or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable treaty or
(2) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI stating that interest paid
on the note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively
connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
Alternative documentation may be applicable in certain circumstances.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the
United States and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct
of that trade or business, you will be required to pay United States federal
income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although you will be exempt
from the 30% withholding tax provided the certification requirement described
above is met) in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as
otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a foreign corporation,
you may be required to pay a branch profits tax on the earnings and profits
that are effectively connected to the conduct of your trade or business in the United States.

Withholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on payments of interest (including
original issue discount) and gross proceeds of sale in respect of debt
instruments to you or certain foreign financial institutions (including
investment funds) and other non-US persons receiving payments on your behalf,
if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence,
disclosure and reporting rules, as set forth in recently issued Treasury
regulations. However, the Treasury regulations generally exempt from such
withholding requirement obligations, such as debt instruments, issued before
January 1, 2014, provided that any material modification of such an obligation
made after such date will result in such obligation being considered newly
issued as of the effective date of such modification. These withholding rules
are generally effective with respect to payments of interest made after
December 31, 2013, and with respect to proceeds of sales received after
December 31, 2016. We will not pay any additional amounts to any holders or our
debt instruments in respect of any amounts withheld. You are encouraged to
consult with your tax advisor regarding U.S. withholding taxes and the
application of the recently issued Treasury regulations in light of your
particular circumstances.

Sale, Exchange or other Disposition of Notes.

You generally will not have to pay U.S. federal income tax on any gain or income realized from the sale, redemption,
retirement at maturity or other disposition of your notes, unless:

•     in the case of gain, you are an individual who
is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable
year of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific other
conditions are met;

•     you are subject to tax provisions applicable to
certain United States expatriates; or


•     the gain is effectively connected with your
conduct of a U.S. trade or business.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that
trade or business, you generally will be subject to U.S. income tax on a
net basis on the gain. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may
be subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected earnings and
profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items.

U.S. Federal
Estate Tax.

If you are an
individual and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the United States,
as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, at the time of
your death, your notes will generally not be subject to the U.S. federal
estate tax, unless, at the time of your death (1) you owned actually or
constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all our
classes of stock entitled to vote, or (2) interest on the notes is
effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.

Backup withholding will not apply to
payments of principal or interest made by us or our paying agent, in its
capacity as such, to you if you have provided the required certification that
you are a non-U.S. holder as described in “— U.S. Federal
Withholding Tax” above, and provided that neither we nor our paying agent have
actual knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as described in
“— U.S. Holders” above. We or our paying agent may, however, report
payments of interest on the notes.

The gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes
may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If you sell
your notes outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a
non-U.S. broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information reporting requirements
generally will not apply to that payment. However, U.S. information
reporting, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales
proceeds, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell
your notes through a non-U.S. office of a broker that:

•     is a U.S. person, as defined in the
Internal Revenue Code;

•     derives 50% or more of its gross income in
specific periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;

•     is a “controlled foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or

•     is a foreign partnership, if at any time during
its tax year, one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who in the
aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests in the
partnership, or the foreign partnership is engaged in a U.S. trade or
business, unless the broker has documentary evidence in its files that you are
a non-U.S. person and certain other conditions are met or you otherwise
establish an exemption. If you receive payments of the proceeds of a sale of
your notes to or through a U.S. office of a broker, the payment is subject
to both U.S. backup withholding and information reporting unless you
provide a Form W-8BEN certifying that you are a non-U.S. person or
you otherwise establish an exemption.

You should consult your own tax advisor regarding
application of backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the
availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from backup
withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a
payment to you will be allowed as a refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to
the Internal Revenue Service.

U.S. Federal
Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Warrants

Exercise of Warrants.

You will not generally recognize gain or
loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your basis in the debt securities,
preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock, as the case may be,
received upon the exercise of the warrant will be equal to the sum of your
adjusted tax basis in the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding period
in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock, as
the case may be, received upon the exercise of the warrant will not include the
period during which the warrant was held by you.

Expiration of Warrants.

Upon the expiration of a warrant, you will
recognize a capital loss in an amount equal to your adjusted tax basis in the
warrant.

Sale or
Exchange of Warrants.

Upon
the sale or exchange of a warrant to a person other than us, you will recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized
on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in the warrant. Such gain
or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss
if the warrant was held for more than one year.


Upon
the sale of the warrant to us, the Internal Revenue Service may argue that you
should recognize ordinary income on the sale. You are advised to consult your
own tax advisors as to the consequences of a sale of a warrant to us.

Potential Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax
Consequences

Current and prospective securities holders should
recognize that the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us
may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time
and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously
made. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under
review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal
Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of
regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as
statutory changes. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations of these
laws could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.

State, Local and Foreign Taxes

We, and holders of our debt and equity securities, may
be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions,
including those in which we or they transact business, own property or reside.
It should be noted that we own properties located in a number of state, local
and foreign jurisdictions, and may be required to file tax returns in some or
all of those jurisdictions. The state, local or foreign tax treatment of us and
holders of our debt and equity securities may not conform to the U.S. federal
income tax consequences discussed above. Consequently, you are urged to consult
your advisor regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign
tax laws with respect to any investment in our securities.

Internet Access to Our SEC
Filings

Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to
those reports, as well as our proxy statements and other materials that are

available, free of charge, on the Internet at www.hcreit.com, as soon as
reasonably practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

Forward-Looking
Statements and Risk Factors

This section discusses the most significant factors
that affect our business, operations and financial condition. It does not
describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or
ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, as well as other
risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think
are not material, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. In
that event, the value of our securities could decline.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents
incorporated by reference contain statements that constitute “forward-looking
statements” as that term is defined in the federal securities laws. These
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those regarding:

•     the possible expansion
of our portfolio, including our ability to close our anticipated acquisitions
and investments on currently anticipated terms, or within currently anticipated
timeframes, or at all;

•     the sale of
properties;

•     the performance of our
operators/tenants and properties;

•     our ability to enter
into agreements with new viable tenants for vacant space or for properties that
we take back from financially troubled tenants, if any;

•     our occupancy rates;

•     our ability to
acquire, develop and/or manage properties;

•     our ability to make
distributions to stockholders;


•     our
policies and plans regarding investments, financings and other matters;

•     our ability to
successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and
operations;

•     our tax status as a
real estate investment trust;

•     our critical
accounting policies;

•     our ability to
appropriately balance the use of debt and equity;

•     our ability to access
capital markets or other sources of funds; and

•     our ability to meet
our earnings guidance.

When we use words such as “may,” “will,” “intend,”
“should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate” or similar
expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
uncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may
differ materially from our expectations. This may be a result of various factors,
including, but not limited to:

•     the status of the
economy;

•     the status of capital
markets, including availability and cost of capital;

•     issues facing the
health care industry, including compliance with, and changes to, regulations
and payment policies, responding to government investigations and punitive
settlements and operators’/tenants’ difficulty in cost-effectively obtaining
and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;

•     changes in financing
terms;

•     competition within the
health care, seniors housing and life science industries;

•     negative developments
in the operating results or financial condition of operators/tenants,
including, but not limited to, their ability to pay rent and repay loans;

•     our ability to
transition or sell facilities with profitable results;

•     the failure to make
new investments as and when anticipated;

•     acts of God affecting
our properties;

•     our ability to
re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies occur;

•     our ability to timely
reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to assets sold;

•     operator/tenant or
joint venture partner bankruptcies or insolvencies;

•     the cooperation of
joint venture partners;

•     government regulations
affecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates and operational
requirements;

•     regulatory approval
and market acceptance of the products and technologies of life science tenants;

•     liability or contract
claims by or against operators/tenants;

•     unanticipated
difficulties and/or expenditures relating to future acquisitions;

•     environmental laws
affecting our properties;


•     changes
in rules or practices governing our financial reporting;

•     the movement of U.S.
and foreign currency exchange rates;

•     qualification as a REIT;

•     key management
personnel recruitment and retention; and

•     the risks described
below:

Risk factors related
to our operators’ revenues and expenses

Our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by
occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if
applicable. Expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of
labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues
from government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressure
due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating costs continue
to increase for our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues
and/or any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating
enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator and the value of
other collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extent the value of such
property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset.
Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such
sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively
affect our financial results.

The continued weakened economy may have an adverse
effect on our operators and tenants, including their ability to access credit
or maintain occupancy and/or private pay rates. If the operations, cash flows
or financial condition of our operators are materially adversely impacted by
economic conditions, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected.

Increased competition may affect our operators’ ability
to meet their obligations to

us

The operators of our properties compete on a local and
regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers
that provide comparable services. We cannot be certain that the operators of
all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate
levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Our
operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that
could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses.

Risk factors related to obligor bankruptcies

We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not
be able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,
which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that an obligor
might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons.
Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a
tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our
loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand
immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the
collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws
afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or
reorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings
may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of
a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and
to exercise other rights and remedies.

We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g.,
real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment
property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a
property to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease with
a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations,
we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the
new obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may
take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor
liabilities. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may
be adversely affected.

Transfers of health care facilities may require
regulatory approvals and these

facilities
may not have efficient alternative uses

Transfers of health care facilities to successor
operators frequently are subject to regulatory approvals or notifications,
including, but not limited to, change of ownership approvals under certificate
of need (“CON”) or determination of need laws, state licensure laws and
Medicare and Medicaid provider arrangements, that are not required for
transfers of other types of real estate. The replacement of a health care
facility operator could be delayed by the approval process of any federal,
state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the
replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility. Alternatively,
given the specialized nature of our facilities, we may be required to spend
substantial time and funds to adapt these properties to other uses. If we are
unable


to timely transfer properties to successor
operators or find efficient alternative uses, our revenue and operations may be
adversely affected.

Risk factors related to government regulations

Some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by
government reimbursement. To the extent that an operator/tenant receives a
significant portion of its revenues from government payors, primarily Medicare
and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,
retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs,
court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or
other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, government funding
restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities) and
interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations
and audits at such property. In recent years, government payors have frozen or
reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures. Health
care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to
federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate
timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial
condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no assurance that
adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any
property operator, whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare,
Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services
reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse
effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition and results of
operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its
obligations to us. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government
Regulations — Reimbursement” above.

Our operators and tenants generally are subject to
varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,
certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards.  Our operators’
or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standards
could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of
fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state health
care programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such actions may
have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to
us and, therefore, adversely impact us. See “Item 1 — Business —
Certain Government Regulations — Other Related Laws” above.

Many of our properties may require a license,
registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration,
or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would prevent a
facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants.
These events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’
ability to make rent payments to us.  State and local laws also may regulate
the expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of
medical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health care
facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval from a state agency.
See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations —
Licensing and Certification” above.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of
2010, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
(collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”), provides states with an increased
federal medical assistance percentage under certain conditions. On June 28,
2012, The United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the
Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The
ruling on Medicaid expansion will allow states not to participate in the
expansion—and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion—without losing their
existing Medicaid funding. Given that the federal government substantially
funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear whether any state will pursue this
option, although at least some appear to be considering this option at this
time. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual
effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but further
straining state budgets. While the federal government will pay for
approximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states will be
expected to begin paying for part of those additional costs in 2017. With
increasingly strained budgets, it is unclear how states will pay their share of
these additional Medicaid costs and what other health care expenditures could
be reduced as a result. A significant reduction in other health care related
spending by states to pay for increased Medicaid costs could affect our
tenants’ revenue streams. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain
Government Regulations — Reimbursement” above and “Item 7—Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Health
Care Industry—Health Reform Laws” below.

More generally, and because of the dynamic nature of
the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and
services, and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, we
cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative or
regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business or that of our
tenants.

Risk factors related to liability claims and insurance
costs

In recent years, skilled nursing and seniors housing
operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of
patient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liability
costs have increased in some markets. General and professional liability
insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affect
the property operators’ future


operations, cash flows
and financial condition, and may have a material adverse effect on the property
operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us.

Unfavorable resolution of pending and future
litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition.

From time to time, we may be directly involved in a
number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We may also be named as
defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of
our operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managers
have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various
claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective
businesses. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial
costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable
settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or
future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead
to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations.

Risk factors related to acquisitions

We are exposed to the risk that some of our
acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated
difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including
contingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significant
management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business.
If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the
project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the
project. Such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations.  Furthermore,
there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments,
the completion of which is subject to various conditions, will be consummated
in accordance with anticipated timing, on anticipated terms, or at all.

Risk factors related to joint ventures

We have entered into, and may continue in the future
to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities.
Joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other
methods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might become
insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to
meet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for
guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time have
economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent
with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our
partner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such
disputes and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability
of the joint venture; and that our partner may be in a position to take action
or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests. In addition, our
ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be
restricted. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right to
trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or
acquire our partner’s interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have
initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may
be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or
other capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interest
in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. Joint
ventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners,
which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures.
Even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require
partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property.

Risk factors related to our seniors housing operating
properties

We are exposed to various operational risks with
respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs
or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.  These risks include
fluctuations in occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable,
and private pay rates; economic conditions; competition; federal, state, local,
and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws,
regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of general
and professional liability insurance coverage; state regulation and rights of
residents related to entrance fees; the availability and increases in the cost
of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise).  Any one or a combination
of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations.

Risk factors related to life science facilities

Our tenants in the life science industry face high
levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect their
ability to make payments to us. Research, development and clinical testing of
products and technologies can be very expensive and sources of funds may not be
available to our life science tenants in the future. The products and technologies
that are developed and


manufactured by our life
science tenants may require regulatory approval prior to being made, marketed,
sold and used. The regulatory process can be costly, long and unpredictable.
Even after a tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance, the
product still presents regulatory and liability risks, such as safety concerns,
competition from new products and eventually the expiration of patent
protection. These factors may affect the ability of our life science tenants to
make timely payments to us, which may adversely affect our revenue and
operations.

Risk factors related to indebtedness

Permanent financing for our investments is typically
provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities
and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. The incurrence or assumption
of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could
(1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the
payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the
economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, or
(4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the
rating agencies.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants,
restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisions
require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and
impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and
make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenants could result in
defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in
addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments.
These defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

In addition, adverse economic conditions may impact
the availability of additional funds or could cause the terms on which we are
able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable. In those circumstances,
we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets. Our
access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or
no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market
conditions and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current
and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of
the shares of our capital stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our
obligations and commitments as they mature.

Risk factors related to our credit ratings

We plan to manage the Company to maintain a capital
structure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurance
that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrades in
terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a
material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in
turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
liquidity and/or financial condition.

Risk factors related to swaps

We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time
to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency
exchange rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk
that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these
arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing
our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.
When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a risk that we will
not complete the long-term borrowing against which the swap is intended to
hedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may be adversely
affected.

Risk factors related to environmental laws

Under various federal and state laws, owners or
operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release
of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property
damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental
contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. We may become liable to
reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the
contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the
person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarily
responsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we review
environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior
to taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “all
appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocent
purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments,
we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material
environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be present
in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or
the business or financial condition of our obligors.

Risk factors related to facilities that require
entrance fees


Certain of our seniors housing facilities require the
payment of an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may be
refundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are subject to substantial
oversight by state regulators relating to these funds. As a result of this
oversight, residents of these facilities may have a variety of rights,
including, for example, the right to cancel their contracts within a specified
period of time and certain lien rights. The oversight and rights of residents
within these facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the
operators of such facilities and therefore may negatively impact us.

Risk factors related to facilities under construction
or development

At any given time, we may be in the process of
constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON and
license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use. The
operator also may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enter
into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third party payor
contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary
CON, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the
completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn
any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a
license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider
agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is
able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the
necessary provider agreements or contracts.

In connection with our renovation, redevelopment,
development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, or
suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and
other required governmental permits and authorizations. These factors could
result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we
may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us
unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may not be able to
complete construction and lease-up of a property on schedule, which could
result in increased debt service expense or construction costs.

Additionally, the time frame required for development,
construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait
years for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash
distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations or
refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to
fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may not
produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall
financial performance.

In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular
property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that
property. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on
expected occupancy, rental rates and capital costs. If our financial
projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of
increases in capital costs or other factors, the property may fail to perform
as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs of
repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate,
which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. Additionally,
we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from
existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt
service associated with that property.

We do not know if our tenants will renew their
existing leases, and if they do not,

we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms, or at all

We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew
existing leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times.
If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants to
occupy those properties or sell them. There can be no assurance that we would
be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new
tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be
able to lease those properties at all.

Our ownership of properties through ground leases
exposes us to the loss of such

properties
upon breach or termination of the ground leases

We have acquired an interest in certain of our
properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the
building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the future
through the purchase of interests in ground leases. As the lessee under a
ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon
termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.

Illiquidity of real estate investments could
significantly impede our ability to

respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our
ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes
in economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can be given
that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell
for liquidity reasons. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the
performance of our investments could


adversely affect
our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed
to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in
particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the
real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our
ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us.

Risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds

From time to time, we will have cash available from
(1) the proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments
on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties, including
non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similar
financial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenues and
continue generating attractive returns, we expect to re-invest these proceeds
in a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad variety
of potential investors. This competition for attractive investments may
negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to
us.

Failure to properly manage our rapid growth could
distract our management or increase

our expenses

We have experienced rapid growth and development in a
relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the
future. This growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our
management. Future property acquisitions could place significant additional
demands on, and require us to expand, our management, resources and personnel.
Our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business
and, in particular, our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows, which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to
stockholders. Our growth could also increase our capital requirements, which
may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur
additional debt.

Ownership of property outside the United States may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our
domestic operations

We have operations in Canada and the United Kingdom.  International
development, ownership, and operating activities involve risks that are
different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and
operations.  These risks include, but are not limited to, any international
currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not
qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we
must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT;

challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash;
changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions, including
regionally, nationally, and locally; challenges in managing international
operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and
regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance,
operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings;

foreign
ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries; differences in
lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide
financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and economic
instability; and changes in applicable laws and regulations in the United
States that affect foreign operations.  If we are unable to successfully manage
the risks associated with international expansion and operations, our results
of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Risk factors related to changes in currency exchange
rates

As we expand our operations internationally, currency
exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial
position.  We expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and
expenses in such foreign currencies as the Canadian dollar and the British
pound.  Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial
institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our
exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currency
fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us.

We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT

We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believe we have and will
continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will
face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds
available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our
stockholders because:

•     we would not be
allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable
income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate
rates;

•     we could be subject to
the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local
taxes; and

•     unless we are entitled
to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax
as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were
disqualified.


Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number
of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and
if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and other
income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could
distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we would not be
required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT is not required
to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an
excise tax. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal
Income Tax Considerations” for a discussion of the provisions of the Code that
apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a REIT.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all
distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the
extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporate
stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and
individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally
applicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 20%) with
respect to distributions.

As a result of all these factors, our failure to
qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business
strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of
highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited
judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect
our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify
as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain
qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See
“Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax
Considerations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The 90% annual distribution requirement will decrease
our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial
transactions

To comply with the 90% distribution requirement
applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make
distributions to our stockholders. See “Item 1 — Business
— Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification
as a REIT — Annual Distribution Requirements” included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Although we anticipate that we generally will have
sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution
requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient
cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we may
decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to
avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due to timing differences between
the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the
one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in
arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible
expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures
in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash
or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In
the event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain
cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we
cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends,
if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in another
transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements.
This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations.

The lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable
REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements

We lease certain qualified health care properties to
taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liability companies of which the taxable
REIT subsidiaries are members), which lessees contract with managers (or
related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties.  The
rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee structure are treated as
qualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to an
arms-length lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable REIT
subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor
(as defined in the Code).  If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then
the rents will not be qualifying rents.  See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation —
Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Income Tests.”

If certain sale-leaseback transactions are not
characterized by the Internal Revenue Service as “true leases,” we may be
subject to adverse tax consequences

We have purchased certain properties and leased them
back to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter into similar transactions
in the future. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to be
structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true
lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific
transaction, the Internal Revenue Service might take the position that the
transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other
manner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and
successfully re-characterized by the Internal Revenue Service, we would not be
entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and


cost recovery generally
available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction
were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or
income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the
year of re-characterization.  See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal
Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Asset Tests” and “—
Income Tests.” Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be
recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distribution
requirements for a taxable year.  See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal
Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Annual Distribution
Requirements.”

Other risk factors

We are also subject to other risks. First, our certificate
of incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions on
share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval
requirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for
or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our
incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit or
discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.

Additionally, we are dependent on key personnel.
Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive
officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have an adverse
impact on our operations. We believe that losing more than one could have a
material adverse impact on our business.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, there are various legal proceedings pending to which we are
a party or to which some of our properties are subject arising in the normal
course of business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

In August 2012, we entered into a merger agreement with Sunrise Senior Living,
Inc. (“Sunrise”). Following the announcement of the merger agreement,
complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia and the Chancery Court for the State of Delaware challenging the
merger. The complaints challenge the merger on behalf of a putative class of
Sunrise public stockholders, and name as defendants Sunrise, its directors and
us. The complaints generally allege that the individual defendants breached
their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger and that the entity
defendants aided and abetted that breach. The complaint filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia additionally alleges that
the preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission by Sunrise fails to provide material information in violation of
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder.  The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief against
the merger, unspecified damages and an award of plaintiffs’ expenses, including
attorneys’ fees. On December 5, 2012, the parties executed a Memorandum of
Understanding (the “MOU”) that provisionally settles the lawsuits subject to a
number of conditions.  On January 17, 2013, the parties filed a Joint Motion to
Stay the Proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia based upon the MOU and, on January 23, 2013, the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Virginia entered an order staying the proceedings
for six (6) months as the parties complete the settlement process.  On February
11, 2013, the parties filed a [Proposed] Order Staying All Proceedings in the
Chancery Court for the State of Delaware and, on February 13, 2013, the
Chancery Court for the State of Delaware entered an order staying the
proceedings pending the completion of the settlement process in the lawsuit in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.  On January 9,
2013, we completed our acquisition of the Sunrise property portfolio. Please

Executive
Summary

Company
Overview

Health
Care REIT, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that has been at the
forefront of seniors housing and health care real estate since the company was
founded in 1970.  We are an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio. Our
portfolio spans the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real
estate, including seniors housing communities, skilled nursing/post-acute
facilities, medical office buildings, inpatient and outpatient medical centers
and life science facilities. Our capital programs, when combined with
comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a
single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing,
repositioning and monetizing real estate assets.

The
following table summarizes our consolidated portfolio as of December 31, 2012:

Business Strategy

Our
primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder
value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create
opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of
annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these
objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health
care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, customer
and geographic location.

Substantially
all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and
services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items
represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend
upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and
interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To
the extent that our customers/partners experience operating difficulties and become
unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a
material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity
and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments
through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our proactive
and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally
includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for
each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections,
and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes,
letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management
division actively manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio
with a comprehensive process including tenant relations, lease expirations, the
mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property
performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other
things. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database
to collect and analyze property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct
extensive research to ascertain industry trends.  We evaluate the operating
environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in
operating performance of the facility.  When we identify unacceptable trends,
we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we
are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative
trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the
value of our investment.

In
addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also structure our
investments to help mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are
normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition,
operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are
generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans,
operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.

For
the year ended December 31, 2012, rental income, resident fees and services and
interest and other income represented 61%, 37%, and 2% respectively, of total
revenues (including discontinued operations).  Substantially all of our
operating leases are designed


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

with escalating rent
structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized
on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a
collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent
rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental
payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a
number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal
amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate
adjustments.

Our
primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, resident fees and
services, borrowings under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement,
public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment
dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of
cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal
and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital
expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances,
property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses.  Depending
upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is
sufficient to fund these uses of cash.

We
also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments.  New
investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured
line of credit arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment
dispositions. Our investments generate cash from net operating income and
principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future
investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured line of
credit arrangement, has historically been provided through a combination of the
issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption
of secured debt.

Depending
upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in
the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate
returns to our stockholders. It is also possible that investment dispositions
may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new
investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected.
We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new
investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our
available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured line of
credit arrangement. At December 31, 2012, we had $1.0 billion of cash and cash
equivalents, $107.7 million of restricted cash and $2.0 billion of available
borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement. 
Please see Note 21 of our consolidated financial statements for information
regarding subsequent events that impact our liquidity.

Capital Market Outlook

The
capital markets remain supportive of our investment strategy. For the year
ended December 31, 2012, we raised over $6.0 billion in aggregate gross
proceeds through issuance of common and preferred stock, unsecured debt and a
Canadian denominated term loan. The capital raised, in combination with available
cash and borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured line of credit
arrangement, supported $4.9 billion in gross new investments for the year. We
expect attractive investment opportunities to remain available in the future as
we continue to leverage the benefits of our relationship investment strategy.

Key Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties

We
utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of
our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating
performance, credit strength  and concentration risk.  Management uses these
key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to
our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget
planning purposes.

Operating
Performance

. We believe that net income attributable to common stockholders
(“NICS”) is the most appropriate earnings measure. Other useful supplemental
measures of our operating performance include funds from operations (“FFO”),
net operating income from continuing operations (“NOI”) and same store cash NOI
(“SSCNOI”); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Please refer to the
section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion and
reconciliations of FFO, NOI and SSCNOI. These earnings measures and their
relative per share amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the
valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The
following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating
performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):

Credit Strength.

We measure our credit strength both in
terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how
much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt. The
coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges
(interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends). We
expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to
maintain compliance with our debt covenants. The coverage ratios are based on adjusted
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)
which is discussed in further detail, and reconciled to net income, below in
“Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely
used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison,
investment recommendations and rating of companies. The following table
reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the
periods presented:

Concentration Risk

. We
evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix, investment mix, customer
mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure in
understanding what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain
sectors were to experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our
investments that are real property. In order to qualify as an equity REIT, at
least 75% of our real estate investments must be real property whereby each
property, which includes the land, buildings, improvements, intangibles and
related rights, is owned by us. Investment mix measures the portion of our
investments that relate to our various property types. Customer mix measures
the portion of our investments that relate to our top five customers.
Geographic mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top
five states (or international equivalents). The following table reflects our
recent historical trends of concentration risk by investment balance for the
periods presented:


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

We evaluate our key performance
indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical
trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be
achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are
described in more detail in “Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors” and
other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management regularly
monitors economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans
designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. Our
ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to
effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging
economic and company-specific trends. Please refer to “Business,” “Risk
Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
discussion of these risk factors.

Corporate Governance

Maintaining
investor confidence and trust has become is important in today’s business
environment. Our Board of Directors and management are strongly committed to
policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business
practices. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our
business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value
while meeting all applicable legal requirements. These guidelines meet the
listing standards adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and are available on the
Internet at www.hcreit.com.

Operating Activities

. The
change in net cash provided from operating activities is primarily attributable
to increases in NOI which is primarily due to acquisitions.  Please see
“Results of Operations” for further discussion.

Investing Activities

.  The changes in net cash used in
investing activities are primarily attributable to net changes in real property
investments, real estate loans receivable and investments in unconsolidated
entities which are summarized above in “Key Transactions in 2012.”  Please
refer to Notes 3, 6 and 7 of our consolidated financial statements for
additional information.

Financing Activities

. The changes in net cash provided from
financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our
long-term debt arrangements, the issuance/redemptions of common and preferred
stock, and dividend payments which are summarized above in “Key Transactions in
2012.”  Please refer to Notes 9, 10 and 13 of our consolidated financial
statements for additional information.

consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December
31, 2012, we had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership
ranging from 10% to 50%. Please see Note 7 to our consolidated financial
statements for additional information.  We use financial derivative instruments
to hedge interest rate exposure. Please see Note 11 to our consolidated
financial statements for additional information.  At December 31, 2012, we had nine
outstanding letter of credit obligations. Please see Note 12 to our
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Contractual Obligations

The
following table summarizes our payment requirements under contractual
obligations as of December 31, 2012 (in thousands):


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

At
December 31, 2012, we had a $2,000,000,000 unsecured line of credit arrangement
that is described in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.  At
December 31, 2012, we had no balance outstanding under the unsecured line of
credit arrangement.  Please see Note 21 to our consolidated financial
statements for subsequent event information regarding our unsecured line of
credit arrangement.

We
have $6,145,457,000 of senior unsecured notes principal outstanding with fixed
annual interest rates ranging from 2.25% to 6.50%, payable semi-annually. A
total of $494,403,000 of our senior unsecured notes are convertible notes that
also contain put features.   Please see Note 10 to our consolidated financial
statements for additional information.   In addition, we have a $250,000,000
Canadian denominated unsecured term loan (approximately $251,054,000 USD at
exchange rates on December 31, 2012.)  The loan matures on July 27, 2015 and
includes an option to extend for an additional year at our discretion.  Total
contractual interest obligations on senior unsecured notes and the Canadian
term loan totaled $2,777,745,000 at December 31, 2012.

We
have consolidated secured debt with total outstanding principal of $2,311,586,000,
collateralized by owned properties, with annual interest rates ranging from 1.00%
to 10.00%, payable monthly. The carrying values of the properties securing the
debt totaled $3,953,516,000 at December 31, 2012. Total contractual interest
obligations on consolidated secured debt totaled $757,025,000 at December 31,
2012. Our share of non-recourse secured debt associated with unconsolidated entities
(as reflected in the contractual obligations table above) is $416,914,000 at December
31, 2012.  Our share of contractual interest obligations on our unconsolidated entities’
secured debt is $66,555,000 at December 31, 2012.

At
December 31, 2012, we had operating lease obligations of $699,990,000 relating
primarily to ground leases at certain of our properties and office space leases
and capital lease obligations of $85,853,000 relating to certain lease
investment properties that contain bargain purchase options.

Purchase
obligations include $2,047,400,000 representing the cash portion of the Sunrise
merger and management business sale commitments discussed in Note 21 to our
audited financial statements.  Purchase obligations also include unfunded
construction commitments and contingent purchase obligations. At December 31,
2012, we had outstanding construction financings of $162,984,000 for leased
properties and were committed to providing additional financing of
approximately $213,255,000 to complete construction. At December 31, 2012, we
had contingent purchase obligations totaling $79,963,000. These contingent
purchase obligations relate to unfunded capital improvement obligations and
contingent obligations on acquisitions. Upon funding, amounts due from the
tenant are increased to reflect the additional investment in the property.

Other
long-term liabilities relate to our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, which
is discussed in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.

Capital Structure

As
of December 31, 2012, we had total equity of $10,520,519,000 and a total debt
balance of $8,450,347,000, which represents a debt to total book capitalization
ratio of 45%. Our ratio of debt to market capitalization was 33% at December
31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our adjusted interest coverage
ratio was 3.31x and our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.58x. Also,
at December 31, 2012, we had $1,033,764,000 of cash and cash equivalents,
$107,657,000 of restricted cash and $2,000,000,000 of available borrowing
capacity under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement.

Our
debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default.
Certain agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum
net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2012, we
were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. Please
refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further
discussion. None of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration
which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our primary unsecured
line of credit arrangement, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used
to determine the fees and interest charged.  A summary of certain covenants and
our results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 is as follows:


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

We plan to manage the company to
maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent
with our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any
or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost
and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact
on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial
condition.

On
May 4, 2012, we filed an open-ended automatic or “universal” shelf
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering an
indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock,
preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units. As of January 31, 2013,
we had an effective registration statement on file in connection with our enhanced
dividend reinvestment plan under which we may issue up to 10,000,000 shares of
common stock. As of January 31, 2013, 3,752,914 shares of common stock remained
available for issuance under this registration statement. We have entered into
separate Equity Distribution Agreements with each of UBS Securities LLC, RBS
Securities Inc., KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and Credit Agricole Securities
(USA) Inc. relating to the offer and sale from time to time of up to
$630,015,000 aggregate amount of our common stock (“Equity Shelf Program”). As
of January 31, 2013, we had $457,112,000 of remaining capacity under the Equity
Shelf Program. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing
securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties
and to repay borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangements.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions
of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed seniors housing
triple-net properties from which we receive rent. Certain of our leases contain
annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price
Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s
properties.  These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is
recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash
rental payments due for the period.  If gross operating revenues at our facilities
and/or the Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may
not continue to increase.  Sales of real property would offset revenue
increases and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions, could result in
decreased revenues.  Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates,
resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  For the three months
ended December 31, 2012, we had no lease renewals but we had 12 leases with
rental rate increasers ranging from 0.16% to 0.30% in our seniors housing triple-net
portfolio.  The decrease in interest income is attributable to loan payoffs
(see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional
information).

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and
2010 represents $13,572,000, $15,306,000 and $15,111,000, respectively, of
secured debt interest expense offset by interest allocated to discontinued
operations.  The change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net
effect and timing of assumptions, extinguishments and principal amortizations.

debt principal activity (dollars in thousands):

In connection
with secured debt extinguishments, we recognized losses of $7,791,000 and
$2,405,000 during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2012, respectively.

Depreciation and
amortization increased primarily as a result of new property acquisitions and the
conversions of newly constructed investment properties. To the extent that we
acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for
depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.

Transaction costs represent costs incurred with property
acquisitions (including due diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation
services, and termination of pre-existing relationships computed based on the
fair value of the assets acquired), lease termination fees and other similar
costs.

Changes in gains
on sales of properties are related to property sales which totaled 31, 39 and
73 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.  We
recognized impairment losses on certain held-for-sale facilities as the fair
value less estimated costs to sell exceeded our carrying values. The following
illustrates the reclassification impact as a result of classifying the
properties sold prior to or held for sale at December 31, 2012 as discontinued
operations for the periods presented.  Please refer to Note 5 to our
consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we
recorded $29,684,000 of provision for loan losses, which is primarily
attributable to the write-off of loans related to certain early stage seniors
housing and CCRC development projects.  We did not record any provision for
loan loss or have any loan write-offs for seniors housing triple-net investments
during the year ended December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31,
2012, we wrote off loans totaling $27,008,000, which is attributable to the
write-off of one loan at an entrance fee community.  The provision for loan
losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for
loan losses and is discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 6 to
our consolidated financial statements.

During the year ended December 31, 2012 a portion of our seniors housing triple-net
properties were formed through partnership interests. Net income attributable
to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2012 represents our
partners’ share of net income (loss) relating to those properties. In
connection with a seniors housing triple-net partnership, we also acquired a
minority interest in a separate unconsolidated entity. This investment is
reflected as an investment in unconsolidated entities on our consolidated
balance sheet. Accordingly, our proportionate share of net income (loss) is
reflected as income (loss) from unconsolidated entities on our consolidated
income statement.

Seniors Housing Operating

As discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements,
we completed additional acquisitions within our seniors housing operating
segment during the year ended December 31, 2012. The results of operations for
these properties have been included in our consolidated results of operations
from the dates of acquisition. The seniors housing operating acquisitions were
structured under RIDEA, which is discussed in Note 18 to our consolidated
financial statements. When considering new acquisitions utilizing the RIDEA
structure, we look for opportunities with best-in-class operators with a strong
seasoned leadership team, high-quality real estate in attractive markets,
growth potential above the standard rent escalators in our triple-net lease
seniors housing portfolio, and alignment of economic interests with our
operating partner.  Our seniors housing operating properties offer us the
opportunity for external growth because we have the right to fund future
seniors housing investment opportunities sourced by our operating partners.
There were no seniors housing operating segment investments prior to September
1, 2010. As such, the increases in NOI are almost entirely attributable to
property acquisitions which totaled 32, 58, and 80 for the years ended December
31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. The following is a summary of our
seniors housing operating results of operations (dollars in thousands):

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Fluctuations in revenues and property operating expenses are
primarily a result of acquisitions subsequent to September 30, 2010. Interest
income relates to the Sunrise loan funded during the three months ended

December 31, 2012 (please see Note 6 to
our consolidated financial statements for additional information).

The
fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are due to acquisitions offset by
variations in amortization of short-lived intangible assets. To the extent that
we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts
will change accordingly. Loss from unconsolidated entities

during the year ended December 31, 2012

is
primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization of short-lived
intangible assets related to our joint venture with Chartwell described in Note
7 to our consolidated financial statements.

Interest expense represents secured debt interest expense as well as interest
expense related to our unsecured Canadian term loan discussed further in Note
10 of our audited consolidated financial statements.

principal activity, which excludes the Canadian term loan (dollars in

In connection with secured
debt extinguishments, we recognized gains of $979,000 and $2,697,000 during the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively.

In addition, during the year ended

December
31, 2012

, we recognized a
net realized gain on derivatives of $1,921,000 associated with our Chartwell
transaction discussed in Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial
statements.

Transaction
costs were incurred in connection with acquisitions that occurred during the
relevant periods. Transaction costs generally include due diligence costs and
fees for legal and valuation services, charges associated with the termination
of pre-existing relationships computed based on the fair value of the assets
acquired and lease termination fees. The decline in transaction costs from 2011
to 2012 is primarily attributable to termination of pre-existing relationships
incurred during 2011.  The majority of our seniors housing operating properties
are formed through partnership interests. Net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2012 represents our
partners’ share of net income (loss) related to those properties.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The increase in rental income is primarily
attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the construction
conversions of medical facilities from which we receive rent. Certain of our
leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the
Consumer Price Index.  These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent
is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash
rental payments due for the period.  If the Consumer Price Index does not
increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase.  Sales of
real property would offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they
exceed new acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues.  Our leases could
renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease
in rental income.  For the three months ended December 31, 2012, our
consolidated medical office building portfolio signed 50,323 square feet of new
leases and 172,647 square feet of renewals.  The weighted-average term of
these leases was five years, with a rate of $20.55 per square foot and tenant
improvement and lease commission costs of $8.77 per square foot.  Substantially
all of these leases during the referenced quarter contain an annual fixed or
contingent escalation rent structure ranging from the change in CPI to
3%.  For the three months ended December 31, 2012, we had no lease
renewals but we had one lease with a rental rate increaser of 2.0% in our
hospital portfolio.  Interest income increased from the prior period primarily
due to an increase in outstanding balances for medical facility real estate loans.

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010
represents $38,786,000, $31,477,000, and $24,926,000, respectively, of secured
debt interest expense offset by interest allocated to discontinued operations. 
The change in secured debt interest expense is primarily due to the net effect
and timing of assumptions, extinguishments and principal amortizations.  The
following is a summary of our medical facilities secured debt principal
activity (dollars in thousands):

In connection with secured debt extinguishments, we recognized a
loss of $1,308,000 and a gain of $483,000 during the years ended December 31,
2010 and 2012, respectively.

The increase in property operating expenses and depreciation and
amortization is primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions
of new medical facilities for which we incur certain property operating
expenses offset by property operating expenses associated with discontinued
operations.

Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2012 represent
costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of new properties.

During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $2,010,000 of
provision for loan losses, which is primarily attributable to the write-off of
a hospital loan.

Income from unconsolidated entities includes our share of net
income related to our joint venture investment with Forest City Enterprises and
certain unconsolidated property investments related to our strategic joint
venture relationship with a national medical office building company.  See Note
7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Changes in gains/losses on sales of properties is related
to property sales which totaled seven, three and 20 for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively.  We recognized impairment
losses on certain held for sale facilities as the fair value less estimated
costs to sell exceeded our carrying values.  The following illustrates the
reclassification impact as a result of classifying the properties sold prior to
or held for sale at December 31, 2012 as discontinued operations for the
periods presented.  Please refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial
statements for further discussion.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The change in interest expense on senior
unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments.  Please
refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional
information.  We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for
the construction of properties owned directly by us. The amount capitalized is
based upon the balances outstanding during the construction period using the
rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing. Our interest expense
is reduced by the amount capitalized.  Please see Note 11 to our consolidated
financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swap agreements and
their impact on interest expense.  Loan expense represents the amortization of
deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the issuance and amendments of
debt. Loan expense changes are due to amortization of charges for costs
incurred for senior unsecured note issuance.  The change in interest expense on
the unsecured line of credit arrangements is due primarily to the net effect
and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes.  Please refer
to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information
regarding our unsecured line of credit arrangements.

General and administrative expenses
as a percentage of consolidated revenues (including revenues from discontinued
operations) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 5.12%, 5.37%
and 7.78%, respectively.  The increase in general and administrative expenses
is primarily related to costs associated with our initiatives to attract and
retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives.  The decline
in percent of revenue is primarily related to the increasing revenue base as a
result of our acquisitions.

The
changes in preferred stock dividends and redemption charge are primarily
attributable to the net effect of issuances, redemptions and conversions. 
Please see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We
believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate
earnings measurement. However, we consider FFO to be a useful supplemental
measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real
estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of
real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the
provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically
risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts
have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies
that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as
a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes
historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means
net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses)
from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus
depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
entities.

Net
operating income from continuing operations (“NOI”) is used to evaluate the
operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues,
including tenant reimbursements, less property level operating expenses, which
exclude depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses,
impairments and interest expense. Property operating expenses represent costs
associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our seniors
housing operating and medical facility properties.  These expenses include, but
are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management
fees, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property
taxes and insurance.  General and administrative expenses represent costs
unrelated to property operations or transaction costs.  These expenses include,
but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office
expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets.  Same store cash NOI
(“SSCNOI”) is used to evaluate the cash-based operating performance of our
properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the
composition of our portfolio.  As used herein, same store is generally defined
as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the full three year
reporting period.  Any properties acquired, developed, transitioned or classified
in discontinued operations during that period are excluded from the same store
amounts.  We believe NOI and SSCNOI provide investors relevant and useful
information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at
the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSCNOI to make
decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level
performance of our properties.

EBITDA
stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We
believe that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from
operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides
additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our
operations. We primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio,
which represents EBITDA divided by total interest, and our fixed charge
coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges
include total interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred
dividends.

A covenant
in our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement and Canadian denominated
term loan contains a financial ratio based on a definition of EBITDA that is
specific to that agreement. Failure to satisfy these covenants could result in
an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and
availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on
our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.
Due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we
have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA as defined above and
adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses and
gain/loss on extinguishment of debt. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our
adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents Adjusted EBITDA divided
by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

basis.
Fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and
non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred
dividends. Our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge ratio of at least
1.50 times.

Other
than Adjusted EBITDA, our supplemental reporting measures and similarly
entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt
analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and
investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial
measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical
operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these
measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management.
Adjusted EBITDA is used solely to determine our compliance with a financial
covenant in our primary line of credit arrangement and Canadian denominated
term loan and is not being presented for use by investors for any other
purpose. None of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow
provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP
and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or
liquidity. Finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be
comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment
trusts or other companies.

The table below reflects the
reconciliation of FFO to net income attributable to common stockholders, the
most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented. The
provisions for depreciation and amortization include provisions for
depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations. Noncontrolling
interest amounts represent the noncontrolling interests’ share of transaction
costs and depreciation and amortization.  Unconsolidated entity amounts represent
our share of unconsolidated entities’ depreciation and amortization.  Amounts
are in thousands except for per share data.

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Health Care Industry

The demand for health care services,
and consequently health care properties, is projected to reach unprecedented
levels in the near future. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”) projects that national health expenditures will rise to $3.3 trillion
in 2015 or 18.2% of gross domestic product (“GDP”). The average annual growth
in national health expenditures for 2011 through 2021 is expected to be 5.9%.

While demographics are the primary driver of demand, economic
conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service
utilization rates. We believe the health care property market may be less
susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property
sectors. Investor interest in the market remains strong, especially in specific
sectors such as private-pay senior living and medical office buildings. As a
REIT, we believe we are situated to benefit from any turbulence in the capital
markets due to our access to capital.

The total U.S. population is projected to increase by 18.6%
through 2030. The elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase
by 78.3% through 2030. The elderly are an important component of health care
utilization, especially independent living services, assisted living services,
skilled nursing services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and
physician ambulatory care. Most health care services are provided within a
health care facility such as a hospital, a physician’s office or a seniors
housing community. Therefore, we believe there will be continued demand for
companies, such as ours, with expertise in health care real estate.

Health care real estate investment
opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases. 
We recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health
care service demand.  Health care providers require real estate to house their
businesses and expand their services.  We believe that investment opportunities
in health care real estate will continue to be present due to:

·

The specialized nature
of the industry, which enhances the credibility and experience of our company;

·

The projected
population growth combined with stable or increasing health care utilization
rates, which ensures demand; and

·

The on-going merger
and acquisition activity.

Health Reform Laws

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) and the Health
Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the PPACA
(collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”). The Health Reform Laws contain
various provisions that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of
our properties. Some provisions of the Health Reform Laws may have a positive
impact on our operators’ or tenants’ revenues, by, for example, increasing
coverage of uninsured individuals, while others may have a negative impact on
the reimbursement of our operators or tenants by, for example, altering the
market basket adjustments for certain types of health care facilities. The
Health Reform Laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions that
could apply to our operators and tenants, in the event of one or more
violations of the federal health care regulatory laws. In addition, there are
provisions that impact the health coverage that we and our operators and
tenants provide to our respective employees.   We cannot predict whether the
existing Health Reform Laws, or future health care reform legislation or
regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’
property or business. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of
our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the Health
Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely
affected as well.  On June 28, 2012, The United States Supreme Court upheld the
individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated the
expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion will allow States not
to participate in the expansion – and to forego funding for the Medicaid
expansion – without losing their existing Medicaid funding. Given that the
federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear
whether any state will pursue this option, although at least some appear to be
considering this option at this time.

Impact to Reimbursement of the Operators and Tenants of Our
Properties.

The Health
Reform Laws provide for various changes to the reimbursement that our operators
and tenants may receive. One such change is a reduction to the market basket
adjustments for inpatient acute hospitals, long−term care hospitals,
inpatient rehabilitation facilities, home health agencies, psychiatric
hospitals, hospice care and outpatient hospitals.  Since 2010, the otherwise
applicable percentage increase to the market basket for inpatient acute
hospitals has decreased.  Since 2012, inpatient acute hospitals have also faced
a downward adjustment of the annual percentage increase to the market basket
rate by a “productivity adjustment.” The productivity adjustment may cause the
annual percentage increase to be less than zero, which would mean that
inpatient acute hospitals could face payment rates for a fiscal year that are
less than the payment rates for the preceding year.

A similar productivity adjustment has applied to skilled
nursing facilities since 2012, which means that the payment rates for skilled
nursing facilities may decrease from one year to the next. Long−term care
hospitals have faced a specified percentage decrease


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

in
their annual update for discharges since 2010. Additionally, since 2012,
long−term care hospitals have been subject to the productivity
adjustments, which may decrease the federal payment rates for long−term
care hospitals. Similar productivity adjustments and other adjustments to
payment rates have applied to inpatient rehabilitation facilities, psychiatric
hospitals and outpatient hospitals since 2010.

The Health Reform Laws revise other reimbursement provisions
that may affect our business. For example, the Health Reform Laws reduce
states’ Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) allotments, starting
in 2014 through 2020. These allotments would have provided additional funding
for DSH hospitals that are operators or tenants of our properties, and thus,
any reduction might negatively impact these operators or tenants.

Additionally, under the Health Reform Laws, beginning in
fiscal year 2015, Medicare payments will decrease to hospitals for treatment
associated with hospital acquired conditions. This decreased payment rate may
negatively impact our operators or tenants. To account for excess readmissions,
the Health Reform Laws also call for a reduction of 1% in payments for those hospitals
with higher−than−average risk−adjusted readmission rates
beginning October 1, 2012, 2% beginning in fiscal year 2014, and 3% from fiscal
year 2015 onward. These reductions in payments to our operators or tenants may
affect their ability to make payments to us.

The Health Reform Laws additionally call for the creation of
the Independent Payment Advisory Board (the “Board”), which will be responsible
for establishing payment policies, including recommendations in the event that
Medicare costs exceed a certain threshold. Proposals for recommendations
submitted by the Board prior to December 31, 2018 may not include
recommendations that would reduce payments for hospitals, skilled nursing
facilities, and physicians, among other providers, prior to December 31, 2019. 
On March 22, 2012, the House of Representatives approved legislation that would
repeal the Board.  While this legislation was not passed by the Senate, if such
a repeal were signed into law in the future, reimbursement to our tenants and
operators may be impacted.

The Health Reform Laws also create other mechanisms that
could permit significant changes to payment. For example, the Health Reform
Laws establish the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test
innovative payment and service delivery models to reduce program expenditures
through the use of demonstration programs that can waive existing reimbursement
methodologies. As another example, on November 2, 2011, CMS published the final
rule implementing section 3022 of the Health Reform Laws, which contains
provisions relating to Medicare payment to providers and suppliers
participating in Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”) under the Medicare
Shared Servings Program. Under the program, Medicare will share a percentage of
savings with ACOs that meet certain quality and saving requirements, thereby
allowing providers to receive incentive payments in addition to their
traditional fee−for−service payments. Under the program, more
experienced providers may assume the risk of losses in exchange for greater
potential rewards: ACOs may share up to 50% of the savings under the
one−sided model and up to 60% of the savings under the two−sided
model, depending on their quality and performance. The amount of shared losses
for which an ACO is liable in the two−sided model may not exceed the
following percentages of its updated benchmark: 5% in the first performance
year, 7.5% in the second year, and 10% in the third year. These shared losses
could affect the ability of ACO operators or tenants to meet their financial
obligations to us. The Health Reform Laws also provide additional Medicaid
funding to allow states to carry out the expansion of Medicaid coverage to
certain financially−eligible individuals beginning in 2014, and also permit
states to expand their Medicaid coverage to these individuals since April 1,
2010, if certain conditions are met.   The Health Reform Laws also extend
certain payment rules related to long−term acute care hospitals found in
the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (“MMSEA”).

Additionally, although the Health Reform Laws delayed 
implementation of the Resource Utilization Group, Version Four
(“RUG−IV”), which revises the payment classification system for skilled
nursing facilities, the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010 repealed
this delay retroactively to October 1, 2010. The implementation of the RUG-IV
classification may impact our tenants and operators by revising the
classifications of certain patients.  The federal reimbursement for certain
facilities, such as skilled nursing facilities, incorporates adjustments to
account for facility case-mix. The Health Reform Laws also extend certain
payment rules related to long−term acute care hospitals found in the MMSEA. 
The MMSEA delayed the implementation of a policy referred to as the “25%
threshold rule” that would limit the proportion of patients who can be admitted
from a co-located or host hospital during a cost reporting period and be paid
under the long-term care hospital prospective payment system.  The Health
Reform Laws further extended the delay, which expired at various points in
calendar year 2012, depending on the start of the provider’s cost reporting
period.

Finally, many other changes resulting from the Health Reform
Laws, or implementing regulations or guidance may negatively impact our
operators and tenants. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the Health
Reform Laws and implementing regulations and guidance to determine other
potential effects of the reform.

Impact of Fraud and Abuse Provisions.

The Health
Reform Laws revise health care fraud and abuse provisions that will affect our
operators and tenants. Specifically, the Health Reform Laws allow for up to
treble damages under the Federal False Claims Act for violations related to
state−based health insurance exchanges authorized by the Health Reform
Laws, which will be implemented


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

beginning in 2014. The
Health Reform Laws also impose new civil monetary penalties for false
statements or actions that lead to delayed inspections, with penalties of up to
$15,000 per day for failure to grant timely access and up to $50,000 for a
knowing violation. Additionally, the Health Reform Laws require certain
entities – including providers, suppliers, Medicaid managed care organizations,
Medicare Advantage organizations, and prescription drug program sponsors – to
report and return overpayments to the appropriate payer by the later of (a)
sixty (60) days after the date the overpayment was “identified,” or (b) the
date that the “corresponding cost report” is due. The entity also must notify
the payer in writing of the reason for the overpayment. A violation of these
requirements may result in criminal liability, civil liability under the FCA,
and/or exclusion from the federal health care programs. On February 14, 2012,
CMS published a proposed rule implementing the Health Reform Laws requirement
that health care providers and suppliers report and return
self−identified overpayments by the later of 60 days after the date the
overpayment was identified, or the date any corresponding cost report is due,
if applicable. The Health Reform Laws also amend the Federal Anti−Kickback
Statute (“AKS”) to state that any items or services “resulting from” a
violation of the AKS constitutes a “false or fraudulent claim” under the
Federal False Claims Act. The Health Reform Laws also provide for additional
funding to investigate and prosecute health care fraud and abuse. Accordingly,
the increased penalties under the Health Reform Laws for fraud and abuse
violations may have a negative impact on our operators and tenants in the event
that the government brings an enforcement action or subjects them to penalties.

Further, CMS published final rulemaking to implement the
enhanced provider and supplier screening provisions called for in the Health
Reform Laws. Under the final rule, beginning March 25, 2011, all enrolling and
participating providers and suppliers are assessed an annual administrative fee
and are placed in one of three risk levels (limited, moderate, and high) based
on an assessment of the individual’s or entity’s overall risk of fraud, waste
and abuse. This rule also allows for the temporary suspension of Medicare
payments to providers or suppliers in the event CMS receives credible
information that an overpayment, fraud, or willful misrepresentation has
occurred. The Health Reform Laws granted the Secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services significant discretionary authority to suspend,
exclude, or impose fines on providers and suppliers based on the agency’s
determination that such a provider or supplier is “high−risk,” and, as a
result, this final rulemaking has the potential to materially adversely affect
our operators and tenants who may be evaluated under the enhanced screening
process.

On November 2, 2011, CMS and OIG jointly published the final
rule establishing waivers of certain fraud and abuse laws to ACOs. These
waivers include automatic AKS, Stark, and Civil Monetary Penalty Law waivers
that may be applied in certain situations and that will apply uniformly to each
ACO, ACO participant, and ACO provider/supplier. Notably, the final rule states
that CMS and OIG intend to closely monitor ACOs through June 2013 to ensure
that these waivers are not causing “undesirable effects” and need to be
narrowed to prevent fraud and abuse.

Additionally, provisions of Title VI of the Health Care
Reform Laws are designed to increase transparency and program integrity by
skilled nursing facilities, other nursing facilities and similar providers.
Specifically, skilled nursing facilities and other providers and suppliers will
be required to institute compliance and ethics programs. Additionally, the
Health Reform Laws make it easier for consumers to file complaints against
nursing homes by mandating that states establish complaint websites. The
provisions calling for enhanced transparency will increase the administrative
burden and costs on these providers.

Impact to the Health Care Plans Offered to Our Employees.

The
Health Reform Laws affect employers that provide health plans to their
employees. The new laws change the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D retiree
drug subsidy and extend dependent coverage for dependents up to age 26, among
other changes. We continue to evaluate our health care plans for these changes
as new reform laws are enacted. These changes may affect our operators and
tenants as well.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. 
Management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical if:

·

the nature of the
estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the
susceptibility of such matters to change; and

·

the impact of the
estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is
material.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its
critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to
them.  Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations
used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are
appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future.  However,
since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the
time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change.  If actual experience
differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating
amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting
changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.  Please refer to Note 1
of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on
significant accounting policies that impact us. There were no material changes
to these policies in 2012.

The following table presents information about our critical
accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to develop each
estimate:

Used

Principles of Consolidation

The
  consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our
  wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of joint venture entities in which
  we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and
  where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights have
  been granted to the noncontrolling interests.  In addition, we consolidate
  those entities deemed to be variable interest entities in which we are
  determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany
  transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

We make judgments about which entities are VIEs based on an
  assessment of whether (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do
  not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment
  at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without
  additional subordinated financial support. We

make judgments with respect to our
  level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not)
  the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors includes,
  but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most
  significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form of ownership
  interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and
  seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other investors to
  participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate
  the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or
  control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous
  basis when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation
  of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we perform a
  primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the
  variable interest entity, our assumptions may be different and may result in
  the identification of a different primary beneficiary.

Income Taxes

As
  part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements,
  significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with
  REIT requirements.

Our
  determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions
  may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments to
  income tax expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted
  by federal and state tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a
  REIT, (iii) the potential for built-in-gain recognized related to
  prior-tax-free acquisitions of C corporations, and (iv) changes in tax
  laws. Adjustments required in any given period are included in income.

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Nature of Critical

Accounting Estimate

Assumptions/Approach

Used

Business Combinations

Real
  property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of
  construction period interest. The cost of real property acquired is allocated
  to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their respective
  fair values. Tangible assets primarily consist of land, buildings and
  improvements. The remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable
  intangible assets primarily consisting of the above or below market component
  of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. The total amount of
  other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease
  values and customer relationship values based on management’s evaluation of
  the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease and the Company’s overall
  relationship with that respective tenant.

We
  make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of
  acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the
  relative fair value of each component. The most significant components of our
  allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings
  as-if-vacant, land and in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of
  buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our
  estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of
  depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the
  property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the value of
  in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the
  specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors considered include
  estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods,
  market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. Our assumptions affect
  the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease
  term for the acquired in-place leases.

We
  compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the
  straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives which range from
  15 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for improvements.
  Amortization periods for intangibles are based on the estimated remaining useful
  lives of the underlying agreements.

Allowance for Loan Losses

We
  maintain an allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The
  allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to
  absorb potential losses in our loans receivable.  The determination of the
  allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans.  If
  this evaluation indicates that there is a greater risk of loan charge-offs,
  additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be required.  A
  loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable
  that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to
  the contractual terms of the original loan agreement.  Consistent with this
  definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired.  To the extent
  circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we will
  return these loans to full accrual status.

The
  determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all
  outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated
  collectability of loan payments and principal. We evaluate the collectability
  of our loans receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not
  limited to, delinquency status, historical loan charge-offs, financial
  strength of the borrower and guarantors and value of the underlying property.

Impact
of Inflation

During the past three years, inflation has not
significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate.
Additionally, our earnings are primarily long-term investments with predictable
rates of return. These investments are mainly financed with a combination of
equity, senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our primary unsecured line
of credit arrangement. During inflationary periods, which generally are
accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely
affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate
than new borrowing costs. Presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate
and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that
inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

We are
exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from
adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We seek
to mitigate the

underlying
foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts
hedging these exposures.

We
seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the
terms of new investments with new long-term fixed rate borrowings to the extent
possible. We may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to
hedge interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on our
policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings, but are
also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and
our perception of the future volatility of interest rates. This section is
presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential
fluctuations in interest rates.

We
historically borrow on our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement to
acquire, construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing
properties. Then, as market conditions dictate, we will issue equity or
long-term fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our unsecured line of
credit arrangements.

A
change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with
our fixed rate debt. Interest rate changes, however, will affect the fair value
of our fixed rate debt. Changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity
of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and
earnings, depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt,
variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets. To illustrate the
impact of changes in the interest rate markets, we performed a sensitivity
analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in
net present values arising from a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates to
determine the instruments’ change in fair value. The following table summarizes
the analysis performed as of the dates indicated (in thousands):

Our variable rate debt, including our unsecured line
of credit arrangements, is reflected at fair value. At December 31, 2012, we
had no amounts outstanding related to our variable rate lines of credit and
$276,006,000 outstanding related to our variable rate secured debt. Assuming no
changes in outstanding balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would result
in increased annual interest expense of $2,760,000. At December 31, 2011, we
had $610,000,000 outstanding related to our variable rate line of credit and $415,101,000
outstanding related to our variable rate secured debt. Assuming no changes in
outstanding balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would have resulted in
increased annual interest expense of $10,251,000.

See Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements
for information on our derivative instruments.

We are subject to risks associated with debt
financing, including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced
or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of
current indebtedness. The majority of our borrowings were completed under
indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we
may incur. Accordingly, in the event that we are unable to raise additional
equity or borrow money because of these limitations, our ability to acquire
additional properties may be limited.

For additional information regarding fair values of
financial instruments, see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical
Accounting Policies” and Note 16 to our audited consolidated financial
statements.


Item 8.

Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Health Care
REIT, Inc. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated
statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in Item 15(a)(2) of this Form 10-K. These
financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Health Care REIT,
Inc. at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Health Care REIT, Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February
26, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

HEALTH CARE REIT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(1)

Includes amounts attributable to redeemable
noncontrolling interests.

See accompanying notes.


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Business

Health Care REIT, Inc., an S&P
500 company with headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, is an equity real estate
investment trust (“REIT”) that invests in seniors housing and health care real
estate. Our full service platform offers property management and development
services to our customers. As of December 31, 2012, our diversified portfolio
consisted of 1,025 properties in 46 states, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
Founded in 1970, we were the first real estate investment trust to invest
exclusively in health care facilities.

2. Accounting Policies and Related Matters

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control, through voting rights
or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.

At
inception of joint venture transactions, we identify entities for which control
is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities”
or “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary
of its operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either
(i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling
financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient
to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial
support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the
primary beneficiary.  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810,

Consolidations

(“ASC 810”), requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to
determining whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated on a continuous
basis. This evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and
influence the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that entity’s
economic performance.

For
investments in joint ventures, we evaluate the type of rights held by the
limited partner(s), which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which
the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership.
The assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption
of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be
made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed
if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the
rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or
decreases its ownership in the limited partnership, or (iii) there is an
increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership
interests. We similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited
liability companies.

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue
is recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires that revenue be
recognized after four basic criteria are met. These four criteria include
persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and
determinable income and reasonably assured collectability. Interest income on
loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding
subject to an evaluation of collectability risk. Substantially all of our
operating leases contain escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual
rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the
initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income
related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based
on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  Leases in our
medical office building portfolio typically include some form of operating
expense reimbursement by the tenant.  Certain payments made to operators are
treated as lease incentives and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the
lease term.  We recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in fees,
monthly as services are provided.  Lease agreements with residents generally
have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days’
notice.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less.

Restricted
Cash

Restricted
cash primarily consists of amounts held by lenders to provide future payments
for real estate taxes, insurance, tenant and capital improvements and amounts
held in escrow relating to acquisitions we are entitled to receive over a
period of time as outlined in the escrow agreement.

Deferred
Loan Expenses


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Deferred loan expenses are costs
incurred by us in connection with the issuance, assumption and amendments of
debt arrangements. We amortize these costs over the term of the debt using the
straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method.

Investments
in Unconsolidated Entities

Investments
in less than majority owned entities where our interests represent a general
partnership interest but substantive participating or kick-out rights have been
granted to the limited partners, or where our interests do not represent the
general partnership interest and we do not control the major operating and
financial policies of the entity, are reported under the equity method of
accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee’s
earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations. To the
extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity
level, the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the
related assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in our share
of equity in earnings of the entity.  The initial carrying value of investments
in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity
interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of
interests in the entity. Other equity investments include an investment in
available-for-sale securities. These equity investments represented a minimal
ownership interest in these companies. We evaluate our equity method
investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value
of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When we determine a
decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying
value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded.

Redeemable
Noncontrolling Interests

Certain
noncontrolling interests are redeemable at fair value.  Accordingly, we record
the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests at the greater of (i) the
initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling
interest’s share of net income or loss and its share of other comprehensive
income or loss and dividends or (ii) the redemption value.  In accordance with
ASC 810, the redeemable noncontrolling interests were classified outside of
permanent equity, as a mezzanine item, in the balance sheet.

Real
Property Owned

Real
property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of
construction period interest. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred.  Property acquisitions are accounted for as business
combinations where we measure the assets acquired, liabilities (including
assumed debt and contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests at their fair
values on the acquisition date.  The cost of real property acquired, which
represents substantially all of the purchase price, is allocated to net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair
values. These properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40 years for buildings and 5
to 15 years for improvements. Tangible assets primarily consist of land,
buildings and improvements, including those related to capital leases.  We
consider costs incurred in conjunction with re-leasing properties, including
tenant improvements and lease commissions, to represent the acquisition of
productive assets and, accordingly, such costs are reflected as investment
activities in our statement of cash flows.

The
remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable intangible assets
primarily consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases
and the value associated with the presence of in-place tenants or residents. 
The value allocable to the above or below market component of the acquired
in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount
rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the
difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the
lease over its remaining term, and (ii) management’s estimate of the
amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of
the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in
acquired lease intangibles and below market leases are included in other liabilities
in the balance sheet and are amortized to rental income over the remaining
terms of the respective leases.

The
total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to
in-place lease values and customer relationship values for in-place tenants
based on management’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each
tenant’s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant.
Characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the
nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant,
growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant’s
credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.  The
total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to
in-place lease values for in-place residents with such value representing (i)
value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating
costs that would be incurred in an assumed re-leasing period, and (ii) value
associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during an assumed
re-leasing period.  This intangible asset will be amortized over the assumed
re-leasing period.

The
net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by
property basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets
may be impaired or that the depreciable life may need to be changed. We
consider external factors relating to each asset and the existence of a master
lease which may link the cash flows of an individual asset to a larger
portfolio of assets leased to the same tenant. If these factors and the
projected undiscounted cash flows of the asset over the remaining


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

depreciation period indicate that the asset will not be
recoverable, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair market value.

In addition, we are exposed to the risks
inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the
seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estate
industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to
sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us.

Capitalization
of Construction Period Interest

We
capitalize interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of
properties owned directly by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the
balance outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest
which approximates our cost of financing. We capitalize interest costs related
to construction of real property owned by us. Our interest expense reflected in
the consolidated statements of comprehensive income has been reduced by the
amounts capitalized.

Gain on Sale
of Assets

We
recognize sales of assets only upon the closing of the transaction with the
purchaser. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as
deposits and classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Gains on assets sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing
when (i) the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, (ii) we
are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the
profit, (iii) we have received adequate initial investment from the purchaser and
(iv) other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may be
deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain
recognition on sales of real estate.

Real Estate
Loans Receivable

Real
estate loans receivable consist of mortgage loans and other real estate loans.
Interest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal
amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectability risks. The loans
are primarily collateralized by a first, second or third mortgage lien, a leasehold
mortgage on, or an assignment of the partnership interest in, the related
properties, corporate guaranties and/or personal guaranties.

Allowance
for Losses on Loans Receivable

The
allowance for losses on loans receivable is maintained at a level believed
adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The determination
of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of these loans, including
general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We
evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a combination of
factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, historical loan
charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors and value of the
underlying collateral. If such factors indicate that there is greater risk of
loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may
be required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events,
it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled
according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Consistent
with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. To the
extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we
will return these loans to full accrual status. While a loan is on non-accrual
status, any cash receipts are applied against the outstanding principal
balance.

Goodwill

We
account for goodwill in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Goodwill is tested annually
for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds
the reporting unit’s fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill is less
than the carrying amount of that goodwill.  We have not had any goodwill
impairments.

Fair
Value of Derivative Instruments

Derivatives
are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities.  The
valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the fair value of the instruments.  Fair values of our derivatives
are estimated by pricing models that consider the forward yield curves and discount
rates.  The fair value of our forward exchange contracts are estimated by
pricing models that consider foreign currency spot rates, forward trade rates
and discount rates.  Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts are
subject to significant estimates that may change in the future. See Note 11
for additional information.

Federal
Income Tax

We
have elected to be treated as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our
first taxable year, and made no provision for federal income tax purposes prior
to our acquisition of our “taxable REIT subsidiaries.” As a result of these as
well as subsequent acquisitions, we now record income tax expense or benefit
with respect to certain of our entities that are taxed as taxable REIT
subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular
corporations and not under the REIT provisions.


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and
liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our
financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred
tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any
increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change
in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about expected
future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such
changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe
it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset
will not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that
results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our
judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included
in the tax provision when such changes occur.  See Note 18 for additional
information.

Foreign
Currency

Certain of
our subsidiaries’ functional currencies are the local currencies of their
respective countries. We translate the results of operations of our foreign
subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange in effect during
the period, and we translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in
effect at the end of the period. We record resulting currency translation
adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
stockholders’ equity, on our consolidated balance sheets. We record transaction
gains and losses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Earnings Per
Share

Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the
period adjusted for non-vested shares of restricted stock. The computation of
diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that
the number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common
shares had been issued.

New
Accounting Standards

In May
2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-04, “Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820):
Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements
in U.S. GAAP and IFRS” (“ASU 2011-04”), which requires incremental fair value
disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.  We have adopted ASU
2011-04 effective January 1, 2012.  The adoption of this guidance did not have
a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In June
2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, “Presentation of Comprehensive Income”
(“ASU 2011-05”), which requires entities to present net income and other
comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two
separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive
income.  We have adopted ASU 2011-05 effective January 1, 2012 and presented
total comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of comprehensive
income.  Further disclosures including reconciliation from net income to total
comprehensive income will be required on an annual basis.  The provisions of
ASU No. 2011-12, “Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the
Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income in ASU 2011-05” delayed the requirement to present certain
reclassifications on the face of the financial statements.

Reclassifications

Certain
amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year
presentation.

3. Real Property Acquisitions and
Development

The total purchase price for all properties acquired has been allocated to the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets, liabilities and noncontrolling
interests based upon their respective fair values in accordance with our
accounting policies.

The results of operations for
these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results of operations
since the date of acquisition and are a component of the appropriate segments. 
Transaction costs primarily represent costs incurred with property
acquisitions, including due diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation
services and termination of pre-existing relationships computed based on the
fair value of the assets acquired, lease termination fees and other
acquisition-related costs.  During the year ended December 31, 2012, we

finalized
our purchase price allocation of certain previously reported acquisitions and
there were no material changes from those previously disclosed.

7. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

During the year ended December 31,
2010, we entered into a joint venture investment with Forest City Enterprises
(NYSE:FCE.A and FCE.B). We acquired a 49% interest in a seven-building life
science campus located at University Park in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is
immediately adjacent to the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. At December 31, 2012, our investment of $174,692,000 is recorded as
an investment in unconsolidated entities on the balance sheet. The aggregate
remaining unamortized basis difference of our investment in this joint venture
of $448,000 at December 31, 2012 is primarily attributable to real estate and
related intangible assets and will be amortized over the life of the related
properties and included in the reported amount of income from unconsolidated
entities.

On December 31, 2010, we formed a
strategic partnership with a national medical office building company whereby
the partnership invested in 17 medical office properties.  We own a controlling
interest in 11 properties and consolidate them.  Consolidation is based on a
combination of ownership interest and control of operational decision-making
authority.  We do not own a controlling interest in six properties and account for
them under the equity method.  Our investment in the strategic partnership
provides us access to health systems and includes development and property
management resources.

During the three months ended June
30, 2012, we entered into a joint venture with Chartwell Retirement Residences
(TSX:CSH.UN). The portfolio contains 42 properties in Canada, 39 of which are
owned 50% by us and Chartwell, and three of which we wholly own. All properties
are managed by Chartwell. In connection with the 39 properties, we invested
$223,134,000 of cash which was recorded as an investment in unconsolidated
entities on the balance sheet. The 39 properties are accounted for under the
equity method of accounting and do not qualify as VIEs (variable interest
entities). The joint venture is structured under RIDEA. The aggregate remaining
unamortized basis difference of our investment in this joint venture of
$8,656,000 at December 31, 2012 is primarily attributable to transaction costs
that will be amortized over the weighted-average useful life of the related
properties and included in the reported amount of income from unconsolidated
entities.

The results of operations for these
properties have been included in our consolidated results of operations from
the date of acquisition by the joint ventures and are reflected in our
statements of comprehensive income as income or loss from unconsolidated
entities. The following is a summary of our income from and investments in unconsolidated
entities (dollars in thousands):

9. Borrowings Under Line of Credit Arrangement and Related Items

Please
see Note 21 regarding line of credit activity that occurred subsequent to
December 31, 2012.  At December 31, 2012, we had a $2,000,000,000 unsecured
line of credit arrangement with a consortium of 31 banks with an option to
upsize the facility by up to an additional $500,000,000 through an accordion
feature, allowing for an aggregate commitment of up to $2,500,000,000.  The
revolving credit facility was scheduled to expire July 27, 2015.  Borrowings
under the agreement are subject to interest payable in periods no longer than
three months at either the agent bank’s prime rate of interest or the
applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate, at our option (1.56% at December
31, 2012). The applicable margin is based on certain of our debt ratings and
was 1.35% at December 31, 2012. In addition, we pay a facility fee annually to
each bank based on the bank’s commitment amount. The facility fee depends on certain
of our debt ratings and was 0.25% at December 31, 2012.  Principal is due upon
expiration of the agreement.  In addition, at December 31, 2012, we had a
$5,000,000 unsecured revolving demand note undrawn and bearing interest at
1-month LIBOR plus 110 basis points.

10. Senior Unsecured Notes and Secured
Debt

We may repurchase, redeem or refinance convertible and
non-convertible senior unsecured notes from time to time, taking advantage of
favorable market conditions when available. We may purchase senior notes for
cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender
offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities
pursuant to their terms.   The non-convertible senior unsecured notes are
redeemable at our option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at
a redemption price equal to the sum of (1) the principal amount of the
notes (or portion of such notes) being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon up to the redemption date and (2) any “make-whole” amount
due under the terms of the notes in connection with early redemptions.  
Redemptions and repurchases of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market
conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other
factors.  At December 31, 2012, the annual principal payments due on these debt
obligations were as follows (in thousands):

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we issued
$494,403,000 of 3.00% senior unsecured convertible notes due December 2029,
generating net proceeds of $486,084,000. The notes are convertible, in certain
circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, shares of common stock at an
initial conversion rate of 19.5064 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes,
which represents an initial conversion price of $51.27 per share. In general,
upon conversion, the holder of each note would receive, in respect of the
conversion value of such note, cash up to the principal amount of such note and
common stock for the note’s conversion value in excess of such principal
amount. In addition, on each of December 1, 2014, December 1, 2019
and December 1, 2024, holders may require us to purchase all or a portion
of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The
notes are bifurcated into a debt component and an equity component since they
may be settled in cash upon conversion. The value of the debt component is
based upon the estimated fair value of a similar debt instrument without the
conversion feature at the time of issuance. The difference between the
contractual principal on the debt and the value allocated to the debt of
$29,925,000 was recorded as an equity component and represents the conversion
feature of the instrument. The excess of the contractual principal amount of
the debt over its estimated fair value is amortized to interest expense using
the effective interest method over the period used to estimate the fair value.

Our debt agreements contain
various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Certain agreements
require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and
impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and
make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2012, we were in
compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements.

11. Derivative Instruments

We are exposed to various market risks, including
the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may elect
to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. These
decisions are principally based on our policy to manage the general trend in
interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future
volatility of interest rates.  In addition, non-U.S. investments expose us to
the potential losses associated with adverse changes in foreign currency to
U.S. Dollar exchange rates.  We elected to manage this risk through the use of
a forward exchange contract and issuing debt in the foreign currency.

Interest
Rate Swap Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

For instruments that are designated and qualify
as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”),
and reclassified into earnings in the same period, or periods, during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings.  Gains and losses on the derivative
representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the
assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings.  As of December 31,
2012, we had one interest rate swap for a total aggregate notional amount of
$11,905,000.  The swap hedges interest payments associated with long-term LIBOR
based borrowings and matures on December 31, 2013.   Approximately $1,973,000
of losses, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
(“AOCI”), are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.

Foreign Currency Hedges

For instruments that are designated and qualify
as net investment hedges, the variability in the foreign currency to U.S.
dollar of the instrument is recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment
component of OCI.  The balance of the cumulative translation adjustment
will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged investment is sold or
substantially liquidated.  On February 15, 2012, we entered into a forward
exchange contract to purchase $250,000,000 Canadian Dollars at a fixed rate in
the future.  The forward contract was used to limit exposure to
fluctuations in the Canadian Dollar to U.S. Dollar exchange rate associated
with our initial cash investment funded for the Chartwell transaction.  On
May 3, 2012, this forward exchange contract was settled for a gain of
$2,772,000, which was reflected on the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, and the proceeds were used to fund our investment.    On
May 3, 2012, we also entered into a forward contract to sell $250,000,000
Canadian dollars at a fixed rate on July 31, 2012 to hedge our net investment.
We settled the forward contract on July 31, 2012 with the net loss reflected in
OCI. Upon settlement of the forward contract we entered into a $250,000,000
Canadian Dollar term loan which has been designated as a net investment hedge
of our Chartwell investment and changes in fair value are reported in OCI as no
ineffectiveness is anticipated.

On August 30, 2012, we entered into two cross
currency swaps to purchase £125,000,000.  The swaps were used to limit
exposure to fluctuations in the Pound Sterling to U.S. Dollar exchange rate
associated with our initial cash investment funded for the Sunrise transaction
discussed in Note 21. The cross currency swaps have been designated as a net
investment hedge, and changes in fair value are reported in OCI as no
ineffectiveness is anticipated.

On September 17,
2012, we entered into two forward exchange contracts to purchase $14,000,000
Canadian Dollars and £23,000,000 at a fixed rate in the future.  The

associated with future international transactions.

12. Commitments and Contingencies

At
December 31, 2012, we had nine outstanding letter of credit obligations
totaling $7,172,000 and expiring between 2013 and 2014.  At December 31, 2012,
we had outstanding construction in process of $162,984,000 for leased
properties and were committed to providing additional funds of approximately
$213,255,000 to complete construction. At December 31, 2012, we had contingent
purchase obligations totaling $79,963,000, excluding our Sunrise-related
commitment described in Note 21. These contingent purchase obligations relate
to unfunded capital improvement obligations and contingent obligations on acquisitions.
Rents due from the tenant are increased to reflect the additional investment in
the property.

We
evaluate our leases for operating versus capital lease treatment in accordance
with ASC Topic 840 “Leases.”  A lease is classified as a capital lease if
it provides for transfer of ownership of the leased asset at the end of the
lease term, contains a bargain purchase option, has a lease term greater than
75% of the economic life of the leased asset, or if the net present value of
the future minimum lease payments are in excess of 90% of the fair value of the
leased asset. Certain leases contain bargain purchase options and have been
classified as capital leases.  At December 31, 2012, we had operating lease
obligations of $699,990,000 relating to certain ground leases and Company
office space. We incurred rental expense relating to company office space of $1,534,000,
$1,901,000 and $1,280,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. Regarding the ground leases, we have sublease agreements with
certain of our operators that require the operators to reimburse us for our
monthly operating lease obligations. At December 31, 2012, aggregate future
minimum rentals to be received under these noncancelable subleases totaled $47,632,000.

At
December 31, 2012, future minimum lease payments due under operating and
capital leases are as follows (in thousands):

14. Stock Incentive Plans

Our
Amended and Restated 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizes up to 6,200,000
shares of common stock to be issued at the discretion of the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors. The 2005 Plan replaced the 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The options
granted to officers and key employees under the 1995 Plan vested through 2010
and expire ten years from the date of grant. Our non-employee directors,
officers and key employees are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. The
2005 Plan allows for the issuance of, among other things, stock options,
restricted stock, deferred stock units and dividend equivalent rights. Vesting
periods for options, deferred stock units and restricted shares generally range
from three years for non-employee directors to five years for officers and key
employees. Options expire ten years from the date of grant.

Valuation Assumptions

The
fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions:

rates used were the 7-year U.S. Treasury Notes yield on the date of grant. The
expected life was based on historical experience of similar awards, giving
consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations
regarding future employee behavior.

at December 31, 2012.  During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under our stock incentive
plans was $6,186,000, $3,390,000 and $1,798,000, respectively (determined as of
the date of option exercise).  Cash received from option exercises under our
stock incentive plans was $13,949,000, $8,628,000 and $4,022,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

As of December 31, 2012, there was approximately $5,104,000
of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options
granted under our stock incentive plans.  That cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 4 years.  As of

16. Disclosure about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.

Mortgage Loans and Other Real Estate Loans Receivable

— The fair value of mortgage
loans and other real estate loans receivable is generally estimated by using
level two and level three inputs such as discounting the estimated future cash
flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers
with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The carrying amount
approximates fair value.

Available-for-sale Equity Investments

— Available-for-sale equity
investments are recorded at their fair value based on level one publicly
available trading prices.

Borrowings Under Unsecured Line of Credit Arrangements

— The carrying amount of the
unsecured line of credit arrangements approximates fair value because the
borrowings are interest rate adjustable.

Senior Unsecured Notes

— The fair value of the senior unsecured notes
payable was estimated based on level one publicly available trading prices.

Secured Debt

— The fair value of fixed rate secured debt is estimated
using level two inputs by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the
current rates at which similar loans would be made with similar credit ratings
and for the same remaining maturities.  The carrying amount of variable rate
secured debt approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate
adjustable.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

— Interest rate swap agreements
are recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair market
value.  Fair market value is estimated using level two inputs by utilizing
pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

— Foreign currency forward
contracts are recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair
market value.  Fair market value is determined using level two inputs by
estimating the future value of the currency pair based on existing exchange
rates, comprised of current spot and traded forward points, and calculating a
present value of the net amount using a discount factor based on observable
traded interest rates.

U.S. GAAP provides authoritative
guidance for measuring and disclosing fair value measurements of assets and
liabilities.  The guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The guidance
also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The guidance describes three
levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level
1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level
2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Please see
Note 2 for additional information.

Level
3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and
that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a
Recurring Basis

The market approach is utilized
to measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities reported at fair
value on a recurring basis.  The market approach uses prices and other relevant
information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable
assets or liabilities.

Items
Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

In addition to
items that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we also have assets
and liabilities in our balance sheet that are measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis.  As these assets and liabilities are not measured at fair
value on a recurring basis, they are not included in the tables above. Assets,
liabilities and noncontrolling interests that are measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis include those acquired/assumed in business combinations (see
Note 3) and asset impairments (see Note 5 for impairments of real property and
Note 6 for impairments of loans receivable). We have determined that the fair
value measurements included in each of these assets and liabilities rely
primarily on Company-specific inputs and our assumptions about the use of the
assets and settlement of liabilities, as observable inputs are not available.
As such, we have determined that each of these fair value measurements generally
reside within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We estimate the fair
value of real estate and related intangibles using the income approach and
unobservable data such as net operating income and estimated capitalization and
discount rates.  We also consider local and national industry market data
including comparable sales, and commonly engage an external real estate
appraiser to assist us in our estimation of fair value.  We estimate the fair
value of assets held for sale based on current sales price expectations or, in
the absence of such price expectations, Level 3 inputs described above.  We
estimate the fair value of secured debt assumed in business combinations using
current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be obtained on the
transaction date.

17. Segment Reporting

We
invest in seniors housing and health care real estate. We evaluate our business
and make resource allocations on our five operating segments: seniors housing
triple-net, seniors housing operating, medical office buildings, hospitals and
life science. Our seniors housing triple-net properties include skilled
nursing/post-acute facilities, assisted living facilities, independent
living/continuing care retirement communities and combinations thereof. Under
the seniors housing triple-net segment, we invest in seniors housing and health
care real estate through acquisition and financing of primarily single tenant
properties. Properties acquired are primarily leased under triple-net leases
and we are not involved in the management of the property. Our seniors housing
operating properties include seniors housing communities that are owned and/or
operated through RIDEA structures (see Note 3).

Our
medical facility properties include medical office buildings, hospitals and
life science buildings which are aggregated into our medical facilities
reportable segment. Our medical office buildings are typically leased to
multiple tenants and generally require a certain level of property management.
Our hospital investments are leased and we are not involved in the management
of the property. Our life science investment represents an investment in an
unconsolidated entity (see Note 7).

The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2). The results of
operations for all acquisitions described in Note 3 are included in our
consolidated results of operations from the acquisition dates and are
components of the appropriate segments.  There are no intersegment sales or
transfers.

We
evaluate performance based upon net operating income from continuing operations
(“NOI”) of each segment. We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant
reimbursements, less property level operating expenses, which exclude
depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, transaction
costs, provision for loan losses and interest expense. We believe NOI provides investors
relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance
of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to
make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level
performance of our properties.

Non-segment
revenue consists mainly of interest income on non-real estate investments and
other income. Non-segment assets consist of corporate assets including cash,
deferred loan expenses and corporate offices and equipment among others.
Non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual
segments in determining NOI.

Summary
information for the reportable segments (which excludes unconsolidated
entities) during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows

Income
Taxes and Distributions

We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing
with our first taxable year.  To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, at least 90% of taxable income (excluding 100% of net capital gains)
must be distributed to stockholders.  REITs that do not distribute a certain
amount of current year taxable income in the current year are also subject to a
4% federal excise tax. The main differences between undistributed net income
for federal income tax purposes and financial statement purposes are the
recognition of straight-line rent for reporting purposes, basis differences in
acquisitions, recording of impairments, differing useful lives and depreciation
and amortization methods for real property and the provision for loan losses
for reporting purposes versus bad debt expense for tax purposes.

Cash distributions paid to common
stockholders, for federal income tax purposes, are as follows for the periods
presented:

REITs generally are not
subject to U.S. federal income taxes on that portion of REIT taxable income or
capital gain that is distributed to stockholders.  For the tax year ended December
31, 2012, as a result of acquisitions located in Canada and the United Kingdom,
we were subject to foreign income taxes under the respective tax laws of these
jurisdictions.  The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31,
2012 primarily relates to state taxes, foreign taxes, requirements of ASC
740-10, and taxes on TRS income.

For the tax year ended
December 31, 2012, the Canadian and United Kingdom tax expense amount included
in the consolidated provision for income taxes was $596,000.  We did not hold
an interest in any entity located in a foreign jurisdiction for the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010.

At December 31, 2012, we
recorded a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets of our U.S.
taxable REIT subsidiaries and Canadian entities. These tax attributes are
carried forward in order to offset taxable income in future years.  The
valuation allowances have been established for these assets based upon our
assessment of whether it is more likely than not that such assets may not be
realized. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the valuation allowance
increased primarily due to additional deferred tax assets recorded for Canadian
net operating losses.  At December 31, 2012, we had a net operating loss
(“NOL”) carryforward related to Canadian entities of $32,061,000.  These
Canadian losses have a 20-year carryforward period.  The valuation allowance
rollforward is summarized as follows for the periods presented (dollars in

As a result of certain
acquisitions, we are subject to corporate level taxes for any related asset
dispositions that may occur during the ten-year period immediately after such
assets were owned by a C corporation (“built-in gains tax”). The amount of
income potentially subject to this special corporate level tax is generally
equal to the lesser of (a) the excess of the fair value of the asset over its
adjusted tax basis as of the date it became a REIT asset, or (b) the actual
amount of gain. Some but not all gains recognized during this period of time
could be offset by available net operating losses and capital loss
carryforwards.  As of December 31, 2012, we have acquired an additional 40
assets with built-in gains as of the date of acquisition that could be subject
to the built-in gains tax if disposed of prior to the expiration of the
applicable ten-year period.  We have not recorded a deferred tax liability as a
result of the potential built-in gains tax based on our intentions with respect
to such properties and available tax planning strategies.

Under the provisions of the
REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”), for taxable
years beginning after July 30, 2008, the REIT may lease “qualified health care
properties” on an arm’s-length basis to a TRS if the property is operated on
behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “eligible independent
contractor.” Generally, the rent received from the TRS will meet the related
party rent exception and will be treated as “rents from real property.” A
“qualified health care property” includes real property and any personal
property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital,
nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified
continuing care facility, or other licensed facility which extends medical or
nursing or ancillary services to patients.  We have entered into various joint
ventures that were structured under RIDEA.


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Resident
level rents and related operating expenses for these facilities are reported in
the consolidated financial statements and are subject to federal taxes as the
operations of such facilities are included in a TRS.  Certain net operating
loss carryforwards could be utilized to offset taxable income in future years.

Generally, we are subject to
audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
for the year ended December 31, 2008 and subsequent years and are subject to
audit by state taxing authorities for the year ended December 31, 2007 and
subsequent years. In the future, we will be subject to audit by the Canada
Revenue Agency (“CRA”) and provincial authorities generally for periods
subsequent to our REIT acquisition in May 2012 related to entities acquired or
formed in connection with the acquisition, and by HM Revenue & Customs for
periods subsequent to our REIT acquisition in August 2012 related to entities
acquired or formed in connection with the acquisition.

At December 31, 2012, we had
a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward related to the REIT of $96,253,000. 
Due to our uncertainty regarding the realization of certain deferred tax
assets, we have not recorded a deferred tax asset related to NOLs generated by
the REIT.  These amounts can be used to offset future taxable income (and/or
taxable income for prior years if an audit determines that tax is owed), if
any. The REIT will be entitled to utilize NOLs and tax credit carryforwards
only to the extent that REIT taxable income exceeds our deduction for dividends
paid.  The NOL carryforwards will expire through 2032.

We apply the rules under ASC
740-10 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” for uncertain tax positions
using a “more likely than not” recognition threshold for tax positions.
Pursuant to these rules, we will initially recognize the financial statement
effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical
merits of the tax position, that such a position will be sustained upon
examination by the relevant tax authorities. If the tax benefit meets the “more
likely than not” threshold, the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on
our estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if audited by the
taxing authority.  The following table summarizes the activity related to our
unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

Of the total $6,098,000 of
total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012,
$5,916,000 (exclusive of accrued interest and penalties) relates to the April
1, 2011 Genesis HealthCare Corporation transaction (“Genesis Acquisition”) and
is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet.  As a part of the Genesis Acquisition, we received a full
indemnification from FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC covering income taxes or
other taxes as well as  interest and penalties relating to tax positions taken
by FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC prior to the acquisition.  Accordingly, an
offsetting indemnification asset is recorded in receivables and other assets on
the consolidated balance sheet.  Such indemnification asset is reviewed for
collectability periodically.

There is no amount of
unrecognized tax benefits, currently accrued for, that would have a material
impact on the effective tax rate to the extent that would be recognized.  There
were insignificant uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2012 for which it
is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits would
decrease during 2013.  Interest and penalties totaled $299,000 and $815,000, respectively,
for the year ended December 31, 2012 and are included in income tax expense. 
Of these amounts, $221,000 and $638,000 of interest and penalties,
respectively, relate to the Genesis Acquisition and are offset by the
indemnification asset.

19. Retirement
Arrangements

Under the retirement plan and trust (the “401(k)
Plan”), eligible employees may make contributions, and we may make matching
contributions and a profit sharing contribution. Our contributions to the
401(k) Plan totaled $2,140,000, $1,558,000 and $1,341,000 in 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively.

We have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(“SERP”), a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan, which provides one
executive officer with supplemental deferred retirement benefits. The SERP
provides an opportunity for the participant to receive


HEALTH

CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

retirement
benefits that cannot be paid under our tax-qualified plans because of the
restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Benefits are based on compensation and length of service and the SERP
is unfunded. Benefit payments are expected to total $4,043,000 during the next
five fiscal years and $2,479,000 thereafter. We use a December 31 measurement
date for the SERP. The accrued liability on our balance sheet for the SERP was
$6,665,000 at December 31, 2012 ($5,623,000 at December 31, 2011).

Subsequent Events

Line of Credit Modification

On January 8, 2013, we closed a
$2,750,000,000 unsecured line of credit arrangement consisting of a $2,250,000,000
revolver and a $500,000,000 term loan.  The facility replaced our existing $2,000,000,000
unsecured line of credit arrangement described in Note 9. The revolver matures
on March 31, 2017, but can be extended for an additional year at our option. 
The term loan matures on March 31, 2016, but can be extended up to two years at
our option.  The revolver bears interest at LIBOR plus 117.5 basis points and
has an annual facility fee of 22.5 basis points.  The term loan bears interest
at LIBOR plus 135 basis points. We have an option to upsize the facility by up
to an additional $1,000,000,000 through an accordion feature, allowing for
aggregate commitments of up to $3,750,000,000.  The facility also allows us to
borrow up to $500,000,000 in alternate currencies.

Sunrise Merger

In August 2012, we entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Sunrise
Senior Living, Inc. (“Sunrise”), pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Sunrise
in an all-cash merger (the “Merger”) in which Sunrise stockholders would
receive $14.50 in cash for each share of Sunrise common stock. Subsequent to
December 31, 2012, we completed our acquisition of the Sunrise property
portfolio.  The total estimated purchase price of approximately $3,281,300,000
(which includes certain seniors housing operating investments that occurred
during the year ended December 31, 2012 and are included in Notes 3 and 6) is
comprised of approximately $3,084,400,000 cash consideration and $133,900,000
of assumed debt (excluding our pro rata share of debt at unconsolidated
entities) and excludes fair value and other purchase price accounting
adjustments.  As of December 31, 2012, we were committed to fund an additional
$2,021,400,000 in cash which was sourced from cash on-hand and our new
unsecured line of credit arrangement described above.

In connection with the
Merger Agreement, Sunrise agreed to sell its management business and certain
additional assets and liabilities to Red Fox Management, LP (the “Management
Business Buyer”). Immediately prior to our acquisition of the Sunrise property
portfolio on January 9, 2013, the Management Business Buyer acquired the
Sunrise management company for $130,000,000, with the Company investing
$26,000,000 for a 20% ownership interest. The Management Business Buyer will
provide management services to the communities under an incentive-based
management contract.

Initial accounting for the entire acquisition is
incomplete as of February 26, 2013 due to the complexity of the transaction. 
No measurement period adjustments were recognized for the year ending December
31, 2012 as the transaction closed after year-end.  Pro forma financial
information has not been provided herein due to a lack of sufficient
information at the time of the filing.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period
covered by this report.

Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012 based on the criteria established by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in a report entitled
Internal Control — Integrated Framework.  Based on this assessment, using
the criteria above, management concluded that the Company’s system of internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.

The independent registered
public accounting firm of Ernst & Young LLP, as auditors of the
Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report
on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) occurred during the fourth quarter
of the one-year period covered by this report that materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.


Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited Health Care REIT,
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). Health Care REIT, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Health Care REIT, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012,
based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets of Health Care REIT, Inc. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and
the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 and our
report dated February 26, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
