ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF
    CONTENTS



PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a
    self-administered, equity real estate investment trust that
    invests across the full spectrum of senior housing and health
    care real estate, including independent living/continuing care
    retirement communities, assisted living facilities, skilled
    nursing facilities, hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals
    and medical office buildings. Founded in 1970, we were the first
    real estate investment trust to invest exclusively in health
    care properties. Through the Windrose Medical Properties
    Division, we have property management capabilities and expertise
    in the medical office and hospital sector. Through our HADC
    subsidiary, we offer project management, facility planning and
    property development services. As of December 31, 2006, we
    had $4,132,749,000 of net real estate investments, inclusive of
    credit enhancements, in 578 properties located in
    37 states. At that date, the portfolio included 204
    assisted living facilities, 221 skilled nursing facilities, 47
    independent living/continuing care retirement communities,
    89 medical office buildings and 17 specialty care
    facilities.

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and
    enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash
    dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase
    dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual
    increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To
    meet these objectives, we invest in the full spectrum of senior
    housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment
    portfolio by property type, operator/tenant and geographic
    location.

Depending on the availability and cost of external capital, we
    anticipate investing in additional properties and providing
    loans to qualified obligors. Capital for future investments may
    be provided by borrowing under our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements, public or private offerings of debt or equity
    securities, or the incurrence or assumption of secured
    indebtedness.

References herein to “we,” “us,”
    “our” or the “Company” refer to Health Care
    REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless specifically noted
    otherwise.

Windrose
    Medical Properties Trust Merger

On December 20, 2006, we completed our merger with Windrose
    Medical Properties Trust, a self-managed real estate investment
    trust based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The aggregate purchase
    price was approximately $1,018,345,000, including direct
    acquisition costs of approximately $29,918,000. The Windrose
    merger diversified our portfolio of investments throughout the
    health care delivery system. Windrose shareholders received
    approximately 9,679,000 shares of our common stock (valued
    at $41.00 per share) and Windrose preferred shareholders
    received 2,100,000 shares of our 7.5% Series G
    Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (valued at
    $29.58 per share). Additionally, our investment in Windrose
    includes $183,139,000 of cash provided to Windrose to extinguish
    secured debt, the assumption of $301,641,000 of debt and the
    assumption of other liabilities and minority interests totaling
    $44,683,000. The results of operations for Windrose have been
    included in our consolidated results of operations from the date
    of acquisition.

Property
    Types

Our primary property types include investment properties and
    operating properties. Investment properties are those in which
    we do not participate in the management of the property and
    include skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities,
    independent living/continuing care retirement communities and
    specialty care facilities. Our operating properties are those in
    which we are responsible for the management of the property and
    are primarily medical office buildings. Our properties include
    stand-alone facilities that provide one level of service,
    combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service,
    and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of
    services. The following is a summary of our various property
    types.

Assisted
    Living Facilities

Assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties
    that provide the same services as independent living facilities,
    but also provide supportive care from trained employees to
    residents who require assistance with activities of daily
    living, including management of medications, bathing, dressing,
    toileting, ambulating and eating.

Alzheimer’s/Dementia Care
    Facilities

Certain assisted living facilities may
    include state licensed settings that specialize in caring for
    those afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease

and/or

similar forms of dementia.

Skilled
    Nursing Facilities

Skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental
    properties where the majority of individuals require

24-hour

nursing

and/or

medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for
    Medicaid

and/or

Medicare reimbursement.

Independent
    Living/Continuing Care Retirement Communities

These communities may include one or more of the following
    property types.

Continuing Care Retirement Communities

Continuing care retirement communities include a
    combination of detached homes, an independent living facility,
    an assisted living facility

and/or

a
    skilled nursing facility on one campus. These communities are
    appealing to residents because there is no need for relocating
    when health and medical needs change. Resident payment plans
    vary, but can include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental
    fees.



Active Adult Communities

Active adult
    communities contain primarily for-sale single-family homes,
    townhomes, cluster homes, mobile homes

and/or

condominiums with no specialized services. These communities are
    typically restricted or targeted to adults at least
    55 years of age or older. Residents generally lead an
    independent lifestyle. Communities may include amenities such as
    a clubhouse, golf course and recreational spaces.

Independent Living Facilities

Independent
    living facilities are age-restricted multifamily properties with
    central dining facilities that provide residents access to meals
    and other services such as housekeeping, linen service,
    transportation and social and recreational activities.

Specialty
    Care Facilities

Our specialty care facilities include acute care hospitals,
    long-term acute care hospitals and other specialty care
    hospitals. Acute care hospitals provide a wide range of
    inpatient and outpatient services, including, but not limited
    to, surgery, rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories.
    Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for
    patients with complex medical conditions that require more
    intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than that
    available in most skilled nursing facilities. Other specialty
    care hospitals provide specialized inpatient and outpatient care
    for specific illnesses or diseases, including, among others,
    orthopedic, neurosurgical and behavioral care.

Medical
    Office Buildings

Medical office buildings are office and clinic facilities, often
    located near hospitals or on hospital campuses, specifically
    constructed and designed for the use of physicians and other
    health care personnel to provide services to their patients.
    They may also include ambulatory surgery centers that are used
    for general or specialty surgical procedures not requiring an
    overnight stay in a hospital. Medical office buildings typically
    contain sole and group physician practices and may provide
    laboratory and other patient services.

Investments

We invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health
    care real estate. We diversify our investment portfolio by
    property type, operator/tenant and geographic location. In
    determining whether to invest in a property, we focus on the
    following: (1) the experience of the tenant’s or
    borrower’s management team; (2) the historical and
    projected financial and operational performance of the property;
    (3) the credit of the tenant or borrower; (4) the
    security for the lease or loan; and (5) the capital
    committed to the property by the tenant or borrower. We conduct
    market research and analysis for all potential investments. In
    addition, we review the value of all properties, the interest
    rates and covenant requirements of any debt to be assumed and
    the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that
    is not to be assumed.

We monitor our investments through a variety of methods
    determined by the type of property and operator/tenant. Our
    asset management process generally includes review of monthly
    financial statements and other operating data for each property,
    periodic review of obligor creditworthiness, periodic property
    inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to
    licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other
    collateral. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a
    proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific
    data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain
    industry trends and risks.

Through asset management and research, we evaluate the operating
    environment in each property’s market to determine whether
    payment risk is likely to increase. When we identify
    unacceptable levels of payment risk, we seek to mitigate,
    eliminate or transfer the risk. We categorize the risk as
    obligor, property or market risk. For obligor risk, we typically
    find a substitute operator/tenant to run the property. For
    property risk, we usually work with the operator/tenant to
    institute property-level management changes to address the risk.
    Finally, for market risk, we often encourage an obligor to
    change its capital structure, including refinancing the property
    or raising additional equity. Through these asset management and
    research efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early
    stage to address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the
    collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new
    investments will be available in the future with spreads over
    our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to
    our stockholders.



Investment
    Properties

Our investment properties are those in which we do not
    participate in the management of the property and are primarily
    land, building, improvements and related rights that are leased
    to operators under long-term operating leases. The net value of
    our investment properties aggregated approximately
    $2,823,331,000 at December 31, 2006. The leases generally
    have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain
    one or more five to

15-year

renewal options. Most of our rents are received under

triple-net

leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional
    charges incurred in the operation of the leased property. The
    tenants are required to repair, rebuild and maintain the leased
    properties. Substantially all of these operating leases are
    designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent
    structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are
    generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial
    lease period, subject to a collectibility assessment. Rental
    income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is
    generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments
    due for the period.

At December 31, 2006, 86% of our investment properties were
    subject to master leases. A master lease is a lease of multiple
    properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement.
    From time to time, we may acquire additional properties that are
    then leased to the tenant under the master lease. The tenant is
    required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all
    the properties that are subject to the master lease. Typically,
    the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the
    properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all
    leased properties at the same time. This bundling feature
    benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or
    renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the
    leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing
    properties. This spreads our risk among the entire group of
    properties within the master lease. The bundling feature may
    provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in
    bankruptcy. Subject to certain restrictions, a debtor in
    bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases.
    It is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required
    to assume or reject the master lease as a whole, rather than
    deciding on a property by property basis.

We currently provide for the construction of properties for
    tenants as part of long-term operating leases. We capitalize
    certain interest costs associated with funds used to pay for the
    construction of properties owned by us. The amount capitalized
    is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period
    using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of
    financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount
    capitalized. We also typically charge a transaction fee at the
    commencement of construction. The construction period commences
    upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion
    of the applicable property or the end of a specified period.
    During the construction period, we advance funds to the tenants
    in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which
    require, among other things, site visits by a Company
    representative prior to advancement of funds. During the
    construction period, we generally require an additional credit
    enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds

and/or

completion guaranties. At December 31, 2006, we had
    outstanding construction investments of $138,222,000 and were
    committed to providing additional funds of approximately
    $342,754,000 to complete construction.

Hospital Affiliates Development Corporation (“HADC”)
    is a taxable REIT subsidiary of the Company that was
    incorporated in 1989 in Indiana. The primary objective of HADC
    is to develop quality specialty medical properties for the
    Company, but HADC also provides a select amount of these
    services for third-parties, especially those that are expected
    to be a source of long-term relationships and potential property
    acquisitions. HADC develops and constructs new

“build-to-suit”

and multi-tenant facilities. HADC earns fees from third-parties
    by providing services such as property development, facility
    planning, medical equipment planning and implementation
    services, leasing services and property management. As a taxable
    REIT subsidiary, HADC pays income taxes at regular corporate
    rates on its taxable income.

Operating
    Properties

Our operating properties are those in which we are responsible
    for the property and are typically multi-tenant medical office
    buildings that are leased to multiple health care providers
    (typically hospitals and physician practices) under a gross,
    modified gross or

triple-net

lease structure. Under a gross or modified gross lease, all or a
    portion of our operating expenses are not reimbursed by tenants.
    Accordingly, we incur certain property operating expenses, such
    as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property
    management fees, utilities and insurance. At



December 31, 2006, 39% of our owned medical office
    buildings are managed by a third party property management
    company. At December 31, 2006, 36% of our operating
    property leases are leased to multiple tenants under gross or
    modified gross leases pursuant to which we are responsible for
    certain operating expenses. Substantially all of our leases at
    operating properties include annual base rent escalation clauses
    that are either predetermined fixed increases or are a function
    of an inflation index, and typically have an initial term
    ranging from one to 20 years, with a weighted average
    remaining term of approximately five years as of
    December 31, 2006. Operating property leases are normally
    credit enhanced by guaranties

and/or

letters of credit. The net value of our operating properties
    aggregated approximately $974,298,000 at December 31, 2006.

Mortgage
    Loans

Our investments in mortgage loans are typically structured to
    provide us with interest income, principal amortization and
    transaction fees and are generally secured by a first or second
    mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage. At December 31, 2006,
    we had outstanding mortgage loans of $177,615,000. The interest
    yield (excluding any loans on non-accrual) averaged
    approximately 9.0% per annum on our outstanding mortgage loan
    balances. Our yield on mortgage loans depends upon a number of
    factors, including the stated interest rate, average principal
    amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest
    rate adjustments. The mortgage loans outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 are generally subject to three to

20-year

terms with principal amortization schedules

and/or

balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the
    end of the term. Typically, mortgage loans are cross-defaulted
    and cross-collateralized with other mortgage loans, operating
    leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its
    affiliates.

Working
    Capital Loans

Working capital loans are generally either unsecured or secured
    by the obligor’s leasehold rights, corporate guaranties

and/or

personal guaranties. These loans have terms generally ranging
    from three months to ten years. At December 31, 2006, we
    had outstanding working capital loans of $16,833,000. The
    average interest yield (excluding any loans on non-accrual) was
    approximately 8.7% per annum on our outstanding working
    capital loan balances. At December 31, 2006, we had
    provided working capital loans to nine obligors.

Equity
    Investments

Equity investments consist primarily of investments in private
    companies where we do not have the ability to exercise
    influence. Under the cost method of accounting, investments in
    private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value, distributions of earnings and additional
    investments. For investments in public companies, if any, that
    have readily determinable fair market values, we classify our
    equity investments as

available-for-sale

and, accordingly, record these investments at their fair market
    values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income, a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. These investments represent a minimal
    ownership interest in these companies. In connection with the
    Windrose merger, we assumed a $1,000,000 investment in an
    unconsolidated subsidiary that holds trust preferred securities
    and is accounted for under the cost method.

Segment
    Reporting

Our business consists of two business segments —
    investment properties and operating properties. For additional
    information regarding business segments, see Note 18 to our
    audited consolidated financial statements.

Borrowing
    Policies

We utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund the purchase
    of new properties and to provide loan financing. Our debt and
    equity levels are determined by management to maintain a
    conservative credit profile. Generally, we intend to issue
    unsecured, fixed rate public debt with long-term maturities to
    approximate the maturities on our leases and loans. For
    short-term purposes, we may borrow on our unsecured lines of
    credit arrangements. We replace these borrowings with long-term
    capital such as senior unsecured notes, common stock or
    preferred stock. When terms are deemed favorable, we may invest
    in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. In
    addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged
    properties in which we have invested or



may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. It is
    our intent to limit secured indebtedness. In our agreements with
    our lenders, we are subject to restrictions with respect to
    secured and unsecured indebtedness.

Competition

We compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate
    partnerships, banks, insurance companies, finance companies,
    government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds
    and other investors in the acquisition, development, leasing and
    financing of health care and senior housing properties. We
    compete for investments based on a number of factors including
    rates, financings offered, underwriting criteria and reputation.
    The operators/tenants of our properties compete on a local and
    regional basis with operators/tenants of properties that provide
    comparable services. Operators/tenants compete for patients and
    residents based on a number of factors including quality of
    care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, services
    offered, family preferences, physicians, staff and price. We
    also face competition from other health care facilities for
    tenants, such as physicians and other health care providers,
    that provide comparable facilities and services.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we employed 113 full-time
    employees.



Certain
    Government Regulations

Health
    Law Matters — Generally

We invest in assisted living, skilled nursing, independent
    living facilities/continuing care retirement communities,
    medical office buildings and specialty care facilities, which
    represented approximately 25%, 34%, 13%, 22% and 6%,
    respectively, of our investments at December 31, 2006.

Typically, operators of assisted living and independent living
    facilities do not receive significant funding from governmental
    programs and are regulated by the states, not the federal
    government. Operators of skilled nursing and specialty care
    facilities are subject to federal and state laws that regulate
    the type and quality of the medical

and/or

nursing care provided, ancillary services (e.g., respiratory,
    occupational, physical and infusion therapies), qualifications
    of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy
    of the physical plant and equipment, distribution of
    pharmaceuticals, reimbursement and rate, setting and operating
    policies. In addition, as described below, some of our property
    operators are subject to extensive laws and regulations
    pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including kickbacks,
    physician self-referrals and false claims. Hospitals, physician
    group practice clinics, and other health care facilities in our
    portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local
    licensure, certification, and inspection laws and regulations.
    Our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws could
    result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement,
    imposition of fines, suspension or decertification from federal
    and state health care programs, loss of license or closure of
    the facility.

Licensing
    and Certification

The primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities
    are the states’ licensing laws. In granting and renewing
    these licenses, the regulatory authorities consider numerous
    factors relating to a property’s physical plant and
    operations including, but not limited to, admission and
    discharge standards and staffing and training. A decision to
    grant or renew a license is also affected by a property’s
    record with respect to consumer rights and medication guidelines
    and rules.

Generally, our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are
    required to be licensed on an annual or bi-annual basis and to
    be certified for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs. The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any
    required license or regulatory approval or the failure to
    correct serious survey deficiencies could prevent them from
    continuing operations at a property. In addition, if a property
    is found out of compliance with the conditions of participation
    in Medicare, Medicaid or other health care programs, the
    property may be barred from participation in government
    reimbursement programs. Any of these occurrences may impair the
    ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us. If we
    have to replace a property operator, our ability to replace the
    operator may be affected by federal and state rules and policies
    governing changes in control. This may result in payment delays,
    an inability to find a replacement operator, a significant
    working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other
    difficulties.

Reimbursement

Assisted Living Facilities.

Approximately 33%
    of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, were
    attributable to assisted living facilities. The majority of the
    revenues received by the operators of our assisted living
    facilities are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue
    source is primarily Medicaid waiver programs. As a part of the
    Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) of 1981,
    Congress established a waiver program enabling some states to
    offer Medicaid reimbursement to assisted living facilities as an
    alternative to institutional long-term care services. The
    provisions of OBRA and the subsequent OBRA Acts of 1987 and 1990
    permit states to seek a waiver from typical Medicaid
    requirements to develop cost-effective alternatives to long-term
    care, including Medicaid payments for assisted living and home
    health. At December 31, 2006, seven of our 25 assisted
    living operators received Medicaid reimbursement pursuant to
    Medicaid waivers programs. For the twelve months ended
    September 30, 2006, approximately 13% of the revenues at
    our assisted living facilities were from Medicaid reimbursement.

Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and
    are largely determined by local market conditions and operating
    costs. Generally, facilities receive a higher payment per day
    for a private pay resident than for a Medicaid beneficiary who
    requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid
    reimbursement varies from



state to state. Thus, the revenues generated by operators of our
    assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor
    mix, acuity level, and changes in Medicaid eligibility and
    reimbursement levels. In addition, a state could lose its
    Medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize Medicaid
    dollars to reimburse for assisted living services. Changes in
    revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an
    operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us.

Skilled Nursing Facilities and Specialty Care
    Facilities.

Skilled nursing and specialty care
    facilities typically receive most of their revenues from
    Medicare and Medicaid, with the balance representing private
    pay, including private insurance. Consequently, changes in
    federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely
    affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses,
    including our rent or debt service. Skilled nursing and
    specialty care facilities are subject to periodic pre- and
    post-payment reviews and other audits by federal and state
    authorities. A review or audit of claims of a property operator
    could result in recoupments, denials or delays of payments in
    the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the
    operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us. Due to
    the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor
    settlement accounting, no assurance can be given as to the
    adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators
    for potential adjustments to reimbursements for payor
    settlements. Due to budgetary constraints, governmental payors
    may limit or reduce payments to skilled nursing and specialty
    care facilities. As a result of government reimbursement
    programs being subject to such budgetary pressures and
    legislative and administrative actions, an operator’s
    ability to meet its obligations to us may be significantly
    impaired.

Medicare Reimbursement and Skilled Nursing
    Facilities.

For the twelve months ended
    September 30, 2006, approximately 29% of the revenues at
    our skilled nursing facilities (which comprised 48% of our
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006) were
    from Medicare reimbursement. In an effort to reduce federal
    spending on health care, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997
    (“BBA”) fundamentally altered Medicare payment
    methodologies for skilled nursing facilities by mandating the
    institution of the skilled nursing property prospective payment
    system. The prospective payment system caused Medicare per diem
    reimbursement for skilled nursing property services to decrease.
    The reductions in Medicare payments resulted in immediate
    financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and caused
    a number of operators to seek bankruptcy protection. The federal
    government subsequently passed legislation to lessen the
    negative financial impact from the prospective payment system.
    These payment increases have since expired.

Skilled nursing facilities received a 3.1% inflationary market
    basket increase in Medicare payments for federal fiscal year
    2007, which represents $560 million of additional Medicare
    spending. However, Section 5004 of the Deficit Reduction
    Act of 2005 (“DRA”) reduced Medicare reimbursement to
    skilled nursing facilities for bad debt costs. Section 5008
    of the DRA directs the Secretary (as defined in that statute) to
    conduct a demonstration program beginning January 1, 2008
    assessing the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from
    hospitals in a variety of post-acute care settings, including
    skilled nursing facilties, home care and other settings. The
    outcome of that demonstration program could lead to significant
    changes in Medicare coverage and reimbursement for post-acute
    care. It is not known how either the deomonstration program, or
    as yet unannounced changes in Medicare reimbursement, might
    impact tenants of the Company’s properties.

The moratorium on the therapy caps for Part B outpatient
    rehabilitation services, which had applied through
    December 31, 2005, expired. The therapy caps were mandated
    by the BBA. The annual payment cap of $1,780 per patient
    applies to occupational therapy and a separate $1,780 cap
    applies to speech and physical therapy. Patients exceeding the
    cap will be able to obtain additional Medicare coverage through
    a waiver program if the therapy is deemed medically necessary;
    however, the program is set to expire in December 2007.
    Otherwise, the patient would need to use private funds to pay
    for the cost of therapy above the caps.

Medicare Reimbursement and Specialty Care
    Facilities.

For the twelve months ended
    September 30, 2006, approximately 59% of the revenues at
    our specialty care facilities (which comprised 5% of our
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006) were
    from Medicare. Specialty care facilities generally are
    reimbursed by Medicare under either the diagnosis related group
    prospective payment system reimbursement methodology for
    inpatient hospitals, or the long-term acute care hospital
    prospective payment system for long-term acute care hospitals.
    Acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and
    outpatient services including, but not limited to, surgery,
    rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories. Long-term
    acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for



patients with complex medical conditions that require more
    intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than that
    available in most skilled nursing facilities.

With respect to Medicare’s diagnosis related
    group/outpatient prospective payment system methodology for
    regular hospitals, reimbursement for inpatient services is on
    the basis of a fixed, prospective rate based on the principal
    diagnosis of the patient. Diagnoses are grouped into more than
    500 diagnosis related groups. In some cases, a hospital might be
    able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s
    losses exceed a threshold.

Medicaid Reimbursement.

Medicaid is a major
    payor source for residents in our skilled nursing and specialty
    care facilities. For the twelve months ended September 30,
    2006, approximately 53% of the revenues of our skilled nursing
    facilities and 25% of the revenues of our specialty care
    facilities were attributable to Medicaid payments. The federal
    government and the states share responsibility for financing
    Medicaid. The federal matching rate, known as the Federal
    Medical Assistance Percentage, varies by state based on relative
    per capita income. On average, Medicaid is the largest component
    of total state spending, representing approximately 22.2% of
    total state spending. The percentage of Medicaid dollars used
    for long-term care varies from state to state due in part to
    different ratios of elderly population and eligibility
    requirements. With certain federal guidelines, states have a
    wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and
    reimbursement methodology. Many states reimburse long-term care
    facilities using fixed daily rates, which are applied
    prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs
    incurred in providing patient care. Reasonable costs typically
    include allowances for staffing, administrative and general, and
    property and equipment (e.g., real estate taxes, depreciation
    and fair rental).

In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of
    providing skilled nursing services. Certain states are
    attempting to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid expenditures
    by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits.
    States in which we have skilled nursing property investments
    increased their per diem Medicaid rates roughly 3.5% on average
    for fiscal year 2007. Four of our states effectively froze rates
    in fiscal year 2007, which impacts profitability to the extent
    that expenses continue to rise. In addition, Medicaid rates may
    decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to
    fund budgeted expenditures.

The Medicare Part D drug benefit became effective
    January 1, 2006. The direct impact on nursing facilities is
    that residents dually eligible for Medicare (and enrolled in one
    of the new Part D Plans) and Medicaid now receive
    reimbursement for drugs through Medicare Part D rather than
    through Medicaid. Participants began enrolling in the new
    Part D prescription drug plans on November 15, 2005.
    Part D will result in increased administrative
    responsibilities for nursing home operators because residents
    have the choice of multiple prescription drug plans. Operators
    may also experience increased expenses to the extent that
    patients’ drugs are not covered by their prescription drug
    plan formulary.

The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care
    facilities continue to evolve. Federal and state authorities
    have considered and may seek to implement new or modified
    reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health
    care property operations. The impact of any such change, if
    implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our
    skilled nursing and specialty care property operations. No
    assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels
    will be maintained. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
    payments under a government reimbursement program are currently,
    or will be in the future, sufficient to fully reimburse the
    property operators for their operating and capital expenses. As
    a result, an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to
    us could be adversely impacted.

Other
    Related Laws

Skilled nursing and specialty care facilities (and assisted
    living facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to
    federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the
    operations and financial and other arrangements that may be
    entered into by health care providers. Certain of these laws
    prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose
    of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical
    products or services reimbursable by governmental programs.
    Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary
    services and submit to the government valid and accurate
    statements for each service. Still other laws require providers
    to comply with a variety of safety, health and other
    requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property
    and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violation of
    these laws and regulations may include, but are not limited to,
    criminal

and/or

civil
    penalties and fines and a loss of licensure and immediate
    termination of



governmental payments. In certain circumstances, violation of
    these rules (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent
    behavior) with respect to one property may subject other
    facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions,
    including disqualification from participation in the Medicare
    and Medicaid programs. In the ordinary course of its business, a
    property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries,
    investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that
    oversee these laws and regulations.

Each skilled nursing and specialty care property (and any
    assisted living property that receives Medicaid payments) is
    subject to the federal anti-kickback statute that generally
    prohibits persons from offering, providing, soliciting or
    receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an
    individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which
    payment may be made under a federal health care program such as
    the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Skilled nursing and
    specialty care facilities are also subject to the federal Ethics
    in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the
    Stark Law. The Stark Law generally prohibits the submission of
    claims to Medicare for payment if the claim results from a
    physician referral for certain designated services and the
    physician has a financial relationship with the health service
    provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a
    financial relationship under the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions
    on physician self-referrals and submission of claims apply to
    state Medicaid programs. Further, skilled nursing and specialty
    care facilities (and assisted living facilities that receive
    Medicaid payments) are subject to substantial financial
    penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the False
    Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the False Claims
    Act’s “whistleblower” provisions. Private
    enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part
    to amendments to the False Claims Act that encourage private
    individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These
    whistleblower suits by private individuals, known as qui tam
    actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and
    former patients, nurses and other employees. Recent action under
    the federal False Claims Act have asserted claims for treble
    damages and up to $11,000 per claim on the basis of the
    alleged failure of a property to meet applicable regulations
    relating to the operation of the property. Prosecutions,
    investigations or qui tam actions could have a material adverse
    effect on a property operator’s liquidity, financial
    condition and results of operations which could adversely affect
    the ability of the operator to meet its obligations to us.
    Finally, various state false claim and anti-kickback laws also
    may apply to each property operator. Violation of any of the
    foregoing statutes can result in criminal

and/or

civil
    penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the
    ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
    which became effective January 1, 1997, greatly expanded
    the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and
    broadened its scope to include private health care plans in
    addition to government payors. It also greatly increased funding
    for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation
    and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of
    Health and Human Services to audit, investigate and prosecute
    suspected health care fraud.

Additionally, the administrative simplification provisions of
    this law provide for communication of health information through
    standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and
    security of health information. In order to comply with the
    regulations, health care providers must undergo significant
    operational and technical changes.

Finally, government investigation and enforcement of health care
    laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and
    is expected to continue. Some of these enforcement actions
    represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application
    of false claims laws. The costs for an operator of a health care
    property associated with both defending such enforcement actions
    and the undertakings in settlement agreements can be substantial
    and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an
    operator to meet its obligations to us.

Environmental
    Laws

A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and
    occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect
    health care facility operations or special medical properties.
    Under various federal, state and local environmental laws,
    ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a
    secured lender (such as the Company) may be liable for the costs
    of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at,
    under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well
    as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic
    substances (including government fines and damages for injuries
    to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required
    remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and
    the owner’s or secured lender’s liability



therefor could exceed the value of the property,

and/or

the
    assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence
    of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or
    remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s
    ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such
    property as collateral which, in turn, would reduce our revenue.

Taxation

Federal
    Income Tax Considerations

The following summary of the taxation of the Company and the
    material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and
    equity securities is for general information only and is not tax
    advice. This summary does not address all aspects of taxation
    that may be relevant to certain types of holders of stock or
    securities (including, but not limited to, insurance companies,
    tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
    persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging,
    integrated conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a
    straddle, traders in securities that use a

mark-to-market

method of accounting for their securities, investors in
    pass-through entities and foreign corporations and persons who
    are not citizens or residents of the United States).

This summary does not discuss all of the aspects of
    U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in
    light of your particular investment or other circumstances. In
    addition, this summary does not discuss any state or local
    income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax
    consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal
    income tax law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal
    income tax law, including changes in law or differing
    interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have
    a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax
    consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our
    securities as set forth in this summary. Before you purchase our
    securities, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding
    the particular U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and
    other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our
    securities.

General

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (or
    “REIT”) commencing with our first taxable year. We
    intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as
    a REIT, but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain
    qualified as a REIT for subsequent years. Qualification and
    taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety of
    qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with
    respect to income, assets, distribution level and diversity of
    share ownership as discussed below under
    “— Qualification as a REIT.” There can be no
    assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate
    in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified.

In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general, we will
    not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT
    taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to
    stockholders. We may, however, be subject to tax at normal
    corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not
    distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net
    long-term capital gain, stockholders are required to include
    their proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital
    gain in income, but they will receive a refundable credit for
    their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain.

Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to federal income
    and excise tax as follows:

•

To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital
    gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our
    “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject
    to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax
    rates;

•

We may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on
    certain items of tax preference to the extent that this tax
    exceeds our regular tax;

•

If we have net income from the sale or other disposition of
    “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale
    to customers in the ordinary course of business or other
    non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be
    subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on this income;



•

Any net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in
    general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily
    for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other
    than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of
    property due to an involuntary conversion) will be subject to a
    100% tax;

•

If we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95% gross income tests
    (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our qualification
    as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be
    subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross
    income attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross
    income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes
    of the 75% gross income test (discussed below) or (ii) 95%
    of our gross income (90% of our gross income for taxable years
    beginning on or before October 22, 2004) over the
    amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% gross
    income test (discussed below) multiplied by (2) a fraction
    intended to reflect our profitability;

•

If we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of
    (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year,
    (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year
    (other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on)
    and (3) any undistributed taxable income from preceding
    periods, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of
    such required distribution over amounts actually
    distributed; and

•

We will also be subject to a tax of 100% on the amount of any
    rents from real property, deductions or excess interest paid to
    us by any of our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” that
    would be reduced through reallocation under certain federal
    income tax principles in order to more clearly reflect income of
    the taxable REIT subsidiary. See “— Qualification
    as a REIT — Investments in Taxable REIT
    Subsidiaries.”

If we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been
    a “C” corporation in a carryover basis transaction, we
    could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited
    from the “C” corporation. A “C” corporation
    is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay
    full corporate level federal income tax. If we recognize gain on
    the disposition of the assets during the ten-year period
    beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us,
    then to the extent of the assets’ “built-in gain”
    (i.e., the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the
    adjusted tax basis in the asset, in each case determined as of
    the beginning of the ten-year period), we will be subject to tax
    on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable.
    The results described in this paragraph with respect to the
    recognition of built-in gain assume that the built-in gain
    assets, at the time the built-in gain assets were subject to a
    conversion transaction (either where a “C” corporation
    elected REIT status or a REIT acquired the assets from a
    “C” corporation), were not treated as sold to an
    unrelated party and gain recognized.

Qualification
    as a REIT

A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or association:

(1)

which is managed by one or more trustees or directors;

(2)

the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable
    shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;

(3)

which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the
    federal income tax law relating to REITs;

(4) which is neither a financial institution nor an
    insurance company;

(5)

the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons
    in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first taxable
    year;

(6)

not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is
    owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding its
    first taxable year, directly or indirectly, by or for five or
    fewer individuals (which includes certain entities) (the
    “Five or Fewer Requirement”); and

(7)

which meets certain income and asset tests described below.

Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the
    entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at
    least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or
    during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than
    12 months. For purposes of conditions (5) and (6),
    pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated
    as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception
    in the case of condition (6).



Based on publicly available information, we believe we have
    satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in
    (5) and (6) above. In addition, Article VI of our
    Amended and Restated By-Laws provides for restrictions regarding
    ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are
    intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share
    ownership requirements described in (5) and (6) above.
    These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all
    cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements
    described in (5) and (6) above.

We have complied with, and will continue to comply with,
    regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our
    stockholders requesting information regarding the actual
    ownership of our stock. If despite sending the annual letters,
    we do not know, or after exercising reasonable diligence would
    not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer
    Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer
    Requirement. If we fail to comply with these regulatory rules,
    we will be subject to a monetary penalty. If our failure to
    comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement, the
    penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply
    were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty
    would be imposed.

We may own a number of properties through wholly owned
    subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified
    REIT subsidiary” if 100% of its stock is owned by a REIT
    and the REIT does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable
    REIT subsidiary. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” will
    not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets,
    liabilities and items of income, deductions and credits of a
    “qualified REIT subsidiary” will be treated as assets,
    liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT. A
    “qualified REIT subsidiary” is not subject to federal
    income tax, and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified
    REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against
    ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more
    than 10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or
    more than 5% of the value of our total assets, as described
    below under “— Asset Tests.”

If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability company or a
    trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will
    be deemed to own a proportionate share of the
    partnership’s, limited liability company’s or
    trust’s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving
    our share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited
    liability company or trust, and the gross income will retain the
    same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the
    partnership, limited liability company or trust. These
    “look-through” rules apply for purposes of the income
    tests and assets tests described below.

Income Tests.

There are two separate
    percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we
    must satisfy for each taxable year.

•

At least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
    directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from
    “rents from real property,” other income from
    investments relating to real property or mortgages on real
    property or certain income from qualified temporary investments.

•

At least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
    directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the
    sources qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from
    dividends (including dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries)
    and interest.

For taxable years beginning on or before October 22, 2004,
    (1) payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap
    agreement, option, futures contract, forward rate agreement or
    any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce
    interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred
    and (2) gain from the sale or other disposition of any such
    investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95% gross
    income test. As to transactions entered into in taxable years
    beginning after October 22, 2004, any of our income from a
    “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is
    entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or
    indirectly, to manage the risk of interest rate movements, price
    changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or
    obligations incurred or to be incurred by us, or such other
    risks that are prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is
    excluded from the 95% gross income test. In general, a hedging
    transaction is “clearly identified” if (1) the
    transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the
    end of the day on which it is entered into and (2) the
    items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially
    contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction. An
    identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is
    made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging
    transaction.



Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real
    property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests
    for a REIT only if several conditions are met:

•

The amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the
    income or profits of any person, although rents generally will
    not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed
    percentage or percentages of receipts or sales.

•

Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real
    property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT,
    also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant,
    unless the tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain
    other requirements are met with respect to the real property
    being rented.

•

If rent attributable to personal property leased in connection
    with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total
    rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent
    attributable to such personal property will not qualify as
    “rents from real property.”

•

For rents to qualify as rents from real property, we generally
    must not furnish or render services to tenants, other than
    through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an “independent
    contractor” from whom we derive no income, except that we
    may directly provide services that are “usually or
    customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the
    property is located in connection with the rental of real
    property for occupancy only, or are not otherwise considered
    “rendered to the occupant for his convenience.”

For taxable years beginning after August 5, 1997, a REIT
    has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of
    impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts
    received with respect to that property as rent from real
    property. The amount received or accrued by the REIT during the
    taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a
    property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by
    the REIT directly or indirectly from the property. The amount
    received for any service or management operation for this
    purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150% of the direct
    cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or
    providing the management or operation. Furthermore,
    impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable
    REIT subsidiary subject to certain conditions, and we may still
    treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from
    real property.

The term “interest” generally does not include any
    amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in
    part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount
    generally will not be excluded from the term
    “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed
    percentage of receipts or sales.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income
    tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a
    REIT for such year if we are eligible for relief. For taxable
    years beginning on or before October 22, 2004, these relief
    provisions generally will be available if (1) our failure
    to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to
    willful neglect; (2) we attach a schedule of the sources of
    our income to our return; and (3) any incorrect information
    on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax.
    For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, these
    relief provisions generally will be available if
    (1) following our identification of the failure, we file a
    schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross
    income and (2) the failure to meet such tests was due to
    reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.

It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under
    which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
    provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is
    imposed on an amount equal to (a) the gross income
    attributable to (1) 75% of our gross income over the amount
    of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% income test
    and (2) 95% of our gross income (90% of our gross income
    for taxable years beginning on or before October 22,
    2004) over the amount of qualifying gross income for
    purposes of the 95% income test, multiplied by (b) a
    fraction intended to reflect our profitability.

Asset Tests.

Within 30 days after the
    close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy
    several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our
    assets determined in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. At least 75% of the value of our total
    assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash
    items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of
    our operation), government securities and qualified temporary
    investments. Although the remaining 25% of our assets generally
    may be invested without restriction, we are prohibited from
    owning securities representing more than 10% of either the vote
    (the “10% vote



test”) or value (the “10% value test”) of the
    outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified REIT
    subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Further,
    no more than 20% of the total assets may be represented by
    securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (the
    “20% asset test”) and no more than 5% of the value of
    our total assets may be represented by securities of any
    non-governmental issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary
    (the “5% asset test”), another REIT or a taxable REIT
    subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test and
    the 20% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each
    quarter. There are special rules which provide relief if the
    value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the
    value of the assets of a REIT.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000,
    certain items are excluded from the 10% value test, including
    (1) straight debt securities of an issuer (including
    straight debt that provides certain contingent payments);
    (2) any loan to an individual or an estate; (3) any
    rental agreement described in Section 467 of the Internal
    Revenue Code, other than with a “related person”;
    (4) any obligation to pay rents from real property;
    (5) certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision
    thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, or any
    political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto
    Rico; (6) any security issued by a REIT; and (7) any
    other arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary of the
    Treasury, is excepted from the definition of security
    (“excluded securities”). Special rules apply to
    straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities
    taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If a
    REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds (1) straight
    debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and
    (2) securities of such issuer that are not excluded
    securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1% of such
    issuer’s outstanding securities, the straight debt
    securities will be included in the 10% value test.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, a
    REIT’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not
    treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value
    test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt
    instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for
    purposes of applying the 10% value test (1) to the extent
    of the REIT’s interest as a partner in the partnership and
    (2) if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income
    (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would
    qualify for the 75% gross income test. For taxable years
    beginning after October 22, 2004, for purposes of the 10%
    value test, a REIT’s interest in a partnership’s
    assets is the REIT’s proportionate interest in any
    securities issued by the partnership (other than the excluded
    securities described in the preceding paragraph).

With respect to corrections of failures for which the
    requirements for corrections are satisfied after
    October 22, 2004, regardless of whether such failures
    occurred in taxable years beginning on, before or after such
    date, as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test
    or the 5% asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a
    REIT by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that
    does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT’s assets at
    the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided that
    the disposition occurs within six months following the last day
    of the quarter in which the REIT first identified the assets.
    For violations of any of the REIT asset tests due to reasonable
    cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds
    described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid
    disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter
    by taking certain steps, including disposition of sufficient
    assets within the six month period described above to meet the
    applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to the greater of
    $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net
    income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period
    of time that the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and
    filing a schedule with the Internal Revenue Service that
    describes the non-qualifying assets.

Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.

For
    taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, REITs may
    own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in
    taxable REIT subsidiaries. We and any taxable corporate entity
    in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to
    treat such entity as a “taxable REIT subsidiary.”

Several of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a
    taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject
    to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but
    are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that
    cannot be performed directly by REITs without jeopardizing their
    REIT status. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries will attempt to
    minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can be no
    assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to
    minimize taxes will be successful. To the extent our taxable
    REIT subsidiaries are required to pay federal, state or local
    taxes, the cash available for distribution as dividends to us
    from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced.



The amount of interest on related-party debt that a taxable REIT
    subsidiary may deduct is limited. Further, a 100% tax applies to
    any interest payments by a taxable REIT subsidiary to its
    affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate is not
    commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT subsidiary is permitted
    to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of
    these restrictions.

The Internal Revenue Service may reallocate costs between a REIT
    and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is a lack of
    arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any deductible
    expenses allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would
    increase its tax liability. Further, any amount by which a REIT
    understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable
    REIT subsidiary will, subject to certain exceptions, be subject
    to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may
    be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an
    interest.

Annual Distribution Requirements.

In order to
    avoid being taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to
    make distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to
    our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction
    in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of (i) 90%
    of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard
    to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and
    (ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from
    foreclosure property, minus (2) a portion of certain items
    of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid in the
    taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable
    year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that
    year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution
    payment after such declaration. The amount distributed must not
    be preferential. This means that every stockholder of the class
    of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the
    same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of
    stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its
    dividend rights as a class. To the extent that we do not
    distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least
    90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,”
    as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed
    amount at regular corporate tax rates. Finally, as discussed
    above, we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet
    certain other distribution requirements. We intend to make
    timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual
    distribution requirements.

It is possible that, from time to time, we may not have
    sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%
    distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount
    as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to,
    among other things, (1) timing differences between
    (i) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of
    deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and
    deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or
    (2) the payment of severance benefits that may not be
    deductible to us. In the event that timing differences occur, we
    may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or, if possible,
    pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to
    meet the distribution requirement.

Under certain circumstances, in the event of a deficiency
    determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be able to
    rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement
    for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to
    stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our
    deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year. Thus, we
    may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as
    deficiency distributions; however, we will be required to pay
    applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any
    deduction taken for deficiency distributions.

Failure
    to Qualify as a REIT

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable
    year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any
    applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at
    regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any
    year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be
    deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be
    required to be made in any year. All distributions to
    stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of
    current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these
    distributions and, subject to certain limitations, will be
    eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate
    stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory
    provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT
    for the four taxable years following the year during which
    qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in
    all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief.
    Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to
    incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay
    potentially significant resulting tax liabilities.



In addition to the relief described above under
    “— Income Tests” and
    ‘‘— Asset Tests,” relief is available
    in the event that we violate a provision of the Internal Revenue
    Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if
    (1) the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to
    willful neglect, (2) we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each
    failure to satisfy the provision, and (3) the violation
    does not include a violation described under
    “— Income Tests” or “— Asset
    Tests” above. It is not now possible to determine the
    circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of
    these relief provisions.

Federal
    Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock

Treatment of Taxable
    U.S. Stockholders.

The following summary
    applies to you only if you are a
    “U.S. stockholder.” A
    “U.S. stockholder” is a stockholder of shares of
    stock who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is:

•

a citizen or resident of the United States;

•

a corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a
    corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
    organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any
    political subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•

an estate, the income of which is subject to United States
    federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•

a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise
    primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one
    or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal
    Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the
    trust’s substantial decisions.

So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, distributions on
    shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated
    earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not
    designated as capital gain dividends) will be includable as
    ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. None of these
    distributions will be eligible for the dividends received
    deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.

Generally, for taxable years ending after May 6, 2003
    through December 31, 2008, the maximum marginal rate of tax
    payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations
    that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15%. Except in
    limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to dividends
    paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not
    subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable
    income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The
    reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that
    portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect to
    our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received
    by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT
    subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect
    to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax
    during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute
    100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or
    (3) the amount of any earnings and profits that were
    distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year.

Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will
    be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not
    exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year),
    without regard to the period for which you held our stock.
    However, if you are a corporation, you may be required to treat
    a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income.

If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net long-term
    capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital
    gain, your proportionate share of this net long-term capital
    gain. You would also receive a refundable tax credit for your
    proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained
    capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of
    your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable
    capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid.

You may not include in your federal income tax return any of our
    net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules
    may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and
    preferences be apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution
    declared by us in October, November or December of any year on a
    specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid
    by us and received by you on December 31 of that year,
    provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later
    than January 31 of the following year.



We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to
    treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required
    to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise
    tax discussed under “— General” and
    “— Qualification as a REIT — Annual
    Distribution Requirements” above. As a result, you may be
    required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions
    that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital.
    Moreover, any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as
    a dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as
    the case may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any
    other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings
    and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these
    distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your
    shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax
    basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these
    distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero, after
    which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if
    the shares of our stock are held as a capital asset. The tax
    basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain
    or loss, if any, realized upon sale of the shares of our stock.
    Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which
    were held for six months or less (after application of certain
    holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term
    capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain
    distributions with respect to these shares of our stock.

Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with
    a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of
    our stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us,
    you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the
    difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange
    and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock. This
    gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock
    as a capital asset.

If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment can only be
    determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of
    redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as
    opposed to dividend income) equal to the difference between the
    amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax
    basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption results in a
    “complete termination” of your interest in all classes
    of our equity securities, is a “substantially
    disproportionate redemption” or is “not essentially
    equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you. In applying
    these tests, there must be taken into account your ownership of
    all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common stock,
    preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must
    take into account any equity securities that are considered to
    be constructively owned by you.

If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you no
    longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity
    securities or only own (actually and constructively) an
    insubstantial percentage of our equity securities, then it is
    probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered
    “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and, thus,
    would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a
    distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a
    dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances,
    and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption,
    you should consult your tax advisor to determine their
    application to the particular situation.

Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests described
    above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of
    your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a
    dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or
    accumulated earnings and profits. If the redemption is taxed as
    a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will
    be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If
    you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain
    circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related
    person, or it may be lost entirely.

Gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than
    one year is taxed at a maximum long-term capital gain rate,
    which is currently 15%. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service
    guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends
    as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as
    gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt
    U.S. Stockholders.

Tax-exempt entities,
    including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts
    and individual retirement accounts (“Exempt
    Organizations”), generally are exempt from federal income
    taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their
    unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The
    Internal Revenue Service has issued a published revenue ruling
    that dividend distributions from a REIT to an exempt employee
    pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares
    of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or
    business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on this
    ruling, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations
    generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt
    Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock
    with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI
    pursuant to the



“debt financed property” rules. Likewise, a portion of
    the Exempt Organization’s income from us would constitute
    UBTI if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage
    investment conduit.

In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns
    more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a percentage of
    our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension trust
    holding more than 10% of our stock only if (1) the
    percentage of our income that is UBTI (determined as if we were
    a pension trust) is at least 5%, (2) we qualify as a REIT
    by reason of the modification of the Five or Fewer Requirement
    that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as
    holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the
    pension trust, and (3) either (i) one pension trust
    owns more than 25% of the value of our stock or (ii) a
    group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of
    the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the
    value of our stock.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

Under certain circumstances, you may
    be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments
    made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of,
    shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply only if you:
    (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
    number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your
    social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer
    identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
    Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments
    of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under
    penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer
    identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has
    not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made
    to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and
    tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor
    regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding,
    and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding
    is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup
    withholding with respect to payment to a stockholder will be
    allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s United
    States federal income tax liability and may entitle such
    stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information
    is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition,
    withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to
    stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to
    certify their non-foreign status.

Taxation of Foreign Stockholders.

The
    following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign
    person. The federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly
    complex matter that may be affected by many considerations.

Except as discussed below, distributions to you of cash
    generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary
    dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital
    assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax
    at a rate of 30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that
    tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower
    rate.

In general, you will be subject to United States federal income
    tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with
    respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is
    “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade
    or business in the United States. A corporate foreign
    stockholder that receives income that is, or is treated as,
    effectively connected with a United States trade or business may
    also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in
    addition to regular United States corporate income tax. The
    following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose
    investment in us is not so effectively connected. We expect to
    withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the
    gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless
    (1) you file an Internal Revenue Service

Form W-8ECI

with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively
    connected” or (2) certain other exceptions apply.

Distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale
    or exchange of a United States real property interest will be
    taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax
    Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were
    gains “effectively connected” with a United States
    trade or business. Accordingly, you will be taxed at the normal
    capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on
    these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax
    and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident
    alien individuals. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be
    subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate
    foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption.



We will be required to withhold from distributions subject to
    FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of
    designated capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the
    amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital
    gain dividends. In addition, if we designate prior distributions
    as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions, up to the
    amount of the prior distributions not withheld against, will be
    treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.

For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, any
    capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is
    “regularly traded” on an established securities market
    will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign
    stockholder did not own more than 5% of such class of stock at
    any time during the taxable year. Once this provision takes
    effect, foreign stockholders generally will not be required to
    report distributions received from us on U.S. federal
    income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends
    for U.S. federal income tax purposes including any capital
    gain dividend will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax
    (unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as
    discussed above. In addition, the branch profits tax will no
    longer apply to such distributions.

Unless our shares constitute a “United States real property
    interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively
    connected with a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our
    shares by you generally will not be subject to United States
    taxation. Our shares will not constitute a United States real
    property interest if we qualify as a “domestically
    controlled REIT.” We do, and expect to continue to, qualify
    as a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled
    REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing
    period less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or
    indirectly by foreign stockholders. However, if you are a
    nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States
    for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain
    other conditions apply, you will be subject to a 30% tax on such
    capital gains. In any event, a purchaser of our shares from you
    will not be required under FIRPTA to withhold on the purchase
    price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded”
    on an established securities market or if we are a domestically
    controlled REIT. Otherwise, under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be
    required to withhold 10% of the purchase price and remit such
    amount to the Internal Revenue Service.

Backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally
    not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States
    that are treated as (1) dividends to which the 30% or lower
    treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies;
    (2) capital gains dividends; or (3) distributions
    attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of
    U.S. real property interests. Payment of the proceeds of a
    sale of stock within the United States or conducted through
    certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is subject to
    both backup withholding and information reporting unless the
    beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or
    she is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have
    actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a
    U.S. person) or otherwise established an exemption. You may
    obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
    withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund
    with the Internal Revenue Service.

U.S. Federal
    Income Taxation of Holders of Depositary Shares

Owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were
    owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the
    depositary shares. Thus, you will be required to take into
    account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled
    if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock.

Conversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred
    Stock.

No gain or loss will be recognized upon
    the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary
    shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will,
    upon exchange, be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the
    depositary shares exchanged. If you held your depositary shares
    as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of
    preferred stock, the holding period for your shares of preferred
    stock will include the period during which you owned the
    depositary shares.

U.S. Federal
    Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Debt
    Securities

The following is a general summary of the United States federal
    income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder
    that is a

non-U.S. holder,

as defined below, the United States federal estate tax
    consequences, of purchasing, owning and disposing of debt
    securities periodically offered under one or more indentures,
    the forms of which have been filed as exhibits to this
    registration statement (the “notes”). This summary
    assumes that you hold the notes as capital assets. This summary
    applies to you only if you are the initial holder of the notes
    and you acquire



the notes for a price equal to the issue price of the notes. The
    issue price of the notes is the first price at which a
    substantial amount of the notes is sold other than to bond
    houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in
    the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers.
    In addition, this summary does not consider any foreign, state,
    local or other tax laws that may be applicable to us or a
    purchaser of the notes.

U.S. Holders

The following summary applies to you only if you are a
    U.S. holder, as defined below.

Definition of a U.S. Holder.

A
    “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a note or
    notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes:

•

a citizen or resident of the United States;

•

a corporation or partnership, or other entity classified as a
    corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
    organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any
    political subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•

an estate, the income of which is subject to United States
    federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•

a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise
    primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one
    or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal
    Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the
    trust’s substantial decisions.

Payments of Interest.

Stated interest on the
    notes generally will be taxed as ordinary interest income from
    domestic sources at the time it is paid or accrues in accordance
    with your method of accounting for tax purposes.

Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of
    Notes.

The adjusted tax basis in your note
    acquired at a premium will generally be your cost. You generally
    will recognize taxable gain or loss when you sell or otherwise
    dispose of your notes equal to the difference, if any, between:

•

the amount realized on the sale or other disposition, less any
    amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will be
    taxable in the manner described under “— Payments
    of Interest” above; and

•

your adjusted tax basis in the notes.

Your gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. This
    capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if
    at the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the
    notes for more than one year. Subject to limited exceptions,
    your capital losses cannot be used to offset your ordinary
    income.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

In general, “backup
    withholding” may apply to any payments made to you of
    principal and interest on your note, and to payment of the
    proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your note before
    maturity, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder and
    (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
    number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your
    social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer
    identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
    Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments
    of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under
    penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer
    identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has
    not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.

The amount of any reportable payments, including interest, made
    to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of
    tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be
    reported to you and to the Internal Revenue Service for each
    calendar year. You should consult your tax advisor regarding
    your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and
    the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable.
    The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be
    credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability,
    provided that correct information is provided to the Internal
    Revenue Service.

Non-U.S. Holders

The following summary applies to you if you are a beneficial
    owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above
    (a

“non-U.S. holder”).



Special rules may apply to certain

non-U.S. holders

such as “controlled foreign corporations,”
    “passive foreign investment companies” and
    “foreign personal holding companies.” Such entities
    are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the
    United States federal, state, local and other tax consequences
    that may be relevant to them.

U.S. Federal Withholding Tax.

Subject to
    the discussion below, U.S. federal withholding tax will not
    apply to payments by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as
    such, of principal and interest on your notes under the
    “portfolio interest” exception of the Internal Revenue
    Code, provided that:

•

you do not, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively,
    own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
    classes of our stock entitled to vote;

•

you are not (1) a controlled foreign corporation for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related, directly
    or indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership, as
    provided in the Internal Revenue Code, or (2) a bank
    receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
    Internal Revenue Code;

•

such interest is not effectively connected with your conduct of
    a U.S. trade or business; and

•

you provide a signed written statement, under penalties of
    perjury, which can reliably be related to you, certifying that
    you are not a U.S. person within the meaning of the
    Internal Revenue Code and providing your name and address to:

•

us or our paying agent; or

•

a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial
    institution that holds customers’ securities in the
    ordinary course of its trade or business and holds your notes on
    your behalf and that certifies to us or our paying agent under
    penalties of perjury that it, or the bank or financial
    institution between it and you, has received from you your
    signed, written statement and provides us or our paying agent
    with a copy of such statement.

Treasury regulations provide that:

•

if you are a foreign partnership, the certification requirement
    will generally apply to your partners, and you will be required
    to provide certain information;

•

if you are a foreign trust, the certification requirement will
    generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners depending
    on whether you are a “foreign complex trust,”
    “foreign simple trust,” or “foreign grantor
    trust” as defined in the Treasury regulations; and

•

look-through rules will apply for tiered partnerships, foreign
    simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts.

If you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, you should
    consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these
    Treasury regulations and the certification requirements
    applicable to you.

If you cannot satisfy the portfolio interest requirements
    described above, payments of interest will be subject to the 30%
    United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a
    properly executed (1) Internal Revenue Service

Form W-8BEN

claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the
    benefit of an applicable treaty or (2) Internal Revenue
    Service

Form W-8ECI

stating that interest paid on the note is not subject to
    withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your
    conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Alternative
    documentation may be applicable in certain circumstances.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States
    and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct
    of that trade or business, you will be required to pay United
    States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis
    (although you will be exempt from the 30% withholding tax
    provided the certification requirement described above is met)
    in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as
    otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a
    foreign corporation, you may be required to pay a branch profits
    tax on the earnings and profits that are effectively connected
    to the conduct of your trade or business in the United States.

Sale, Exchange or other Disposition of
    Notes.

You generally will not have to pay
    U.S. federal income tax on any gain or income realized from
    the sale, redemption, retirement at maturity or other
    disposition of your notes, unless:



•

in the case of gain, you are an individual who is present in the
    United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year
    of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific
    other conditions are met;

•

you are subject to tax provisions applicable to certain United
    States expatriates; or

•

the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a
    U.S. trade or business.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States
    and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected
    with the conduct of that trade or business, you generally will
    be subject to U.S. income tax on a net basis on the gain.
    In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be
    subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected
    earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for
    certain items.

U.S. Federal Estate Tax.

If you are an
    individual and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the
    United States, as specially defined for U.S. federal estate
    tax purposes, at the time of your death, your notes will
    generally not be subject to the U.S. federal estate tax,
    unless, at the time of your death (1) you owned actually or
    constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of
    all our classes of stock entitled to vote or (2) interest
    on the notes is effectively connected with your conduct of a
    U.S. trade or business.

Backup Withholding and Information
    Reporting.

Backup withholding will not apply to
    payments of principal or interest made by us or our paying
    agent, in its capacity as such, to you if you have provided the
    required certification that you are a

non-U.S. holder

as described in “— U.S. Federal Withholding
    Tax” above, and provided that neither we nor our paying
    agent have actual knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as
    described in “— U.S. Holders” above. We
    or our paying agent may, however, report payments of interest on
    the notes.

The gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes may be
    subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If
    you sell your notes outside the United States through a

non-U.S. office

of a

non-U.S. broker

and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United
    States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information
    reporting requirements generally will not apply to that payment.
    However, U.S. information reporting, but not backup
    withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if
    that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell your
    notes through a

non-U.S. office

of a broker that:

•

is a U.S. person, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code;

•

derives 50% or more of its gross income in specific periods from
    the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;

•

is a “controlled foreign corporation” for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes; or

•

is a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year,
    one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who in the
    aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests
    in the partnership, or the foreign partnership is engaged in a
    U.S. trade or business, unless the broker has documentary
    evidence in its files that you are a

non-U.S. person

and certain other conditions are met or you otherwise establish
    an exemption. If you receive payments of the proceeds of a sale
    of your notes to or through a U.S. office of a broker, the
    payment is subject to both U.S. backup withholding and
    information reporting unless you provide a

Form W-8BEN

certifying that you are a

non-U.S. person

or you otherwise establish an exemption.

You should consult your own tax advisor regarding application of
    backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the
    availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from
    backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup
    withholding rules from a payment to you will be allowed as a
    refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax
    liability, provided the required information is furnished to the
    Internal Revenue Service.

U.S. Federal
    Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Warrants

Exercise of Warrants.

You will not generally
    recognize gain or loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your
    basis in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares
    or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise
    of the warrant will be equal to the sum of your adjusted tax
    basis in the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding
    period in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary
    shares or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the
    exercise of the warrant will not include the period during which
    the warrant was held by you.



Expiration of Warrants.

Upon the expiration of
    a warrant, you will recognize a capital loss in an amount equal
    to your adjusted tax basis in the warrant.

Sale or Exchange of Warrants.

Upon the sale or
    exchange of a warrant to a person other than us, you will
    recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
    between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your
    adjusted tax basis in the warrant. Such gain or loss will be
    capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss
    if the warrant was held for more than one year. Upon the sale of
    the warrant to us, the Internal Revenue Service may argue that
    you should recognize ordinary income on the sale. You are
    advised to consult your own tax advisors as to the consequences
    of a sale of a warrant to us.

Potential
    Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax
    Consequences

Current and prospective securities holders should recognize that
    the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us
    may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative
    action at any time and that any such action may affect
    investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing
    with federal income taxation are constantly under review by
    persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal
    Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in
    revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of
    established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in
    federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could
    adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.

    Factors

Forward-Looking
    Statements and Risk Factors

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements
    that constitute “forward-looking statements” as that
    term is defined in the federal securities laws. These
    forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
    those regarding:

•

the possible expansion of our portfolio;

•

the sale of properties;

•

the performance of our operators/tenants and properties;

•

our ability to enter into agreements with new viable tenants for
    properties that we take back from financially troubled tenants,
    if any;

•

our ability to retain or increase occupancies in our medical
    office buildings at similar or higher rates;

•

our ability to make distributions to stockholders;

•

our policies and plans regarding investments, financings and
    other matters;

•

our tax status as a real estate investment trust;

•

our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity;

•

our ability to access capital markets or other sources of
    funds; and

•

our ability to meet our earnings guidance.

When we use words such as “may,” “will,”
    “intend,” “should,” “believe,”
    “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate”
    or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking
    statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of



future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Our
    expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may
    differ materially from our expectations. This may be a result of
    various factors, including, but not limited to:

•

the status of the economy;

•

the status of capital markets, including prevailing interest
    rates;

•

issues facing the health care industry, including compliance
    with, and changes to, regulations and payment policies and
    operators’/tenants’ difficulty in cost-effectively
    obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;

•

changes in financing terms;

•

competition within the health care and senior housing industries;

•

negative developments in the operating results or financial
    condition of operators, including, but not limited to, their
    ability to pay rent and repay loans;

•

our ability to transition or sell facilities with profitable
    results;

•

the failure to make new investments as and when anticipated;

•

the failure of closings to occur as and when anticipated;

•

acts of God affecting our properties;

•

our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies
    occur;

•

our ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to
    assets sold;

•

operator bankruptcies or insolvencies;

•

government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid
    reimbursement rates;

•

liability or contract claims by or against operators;

•

unanticipated difficulties

and/or

expenditures relating to future acquisitions;

•

environmental laws affecting our properties;

•

changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting;

•

other legal and operational factors, including REIT
    qualification and key management personnel recruitment and
    retention; and

•

the risks described below:

Risk
    factors related to our operators’ revenues and
    expenses

Our investment property operators’ revenues are primarily
    driven by occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if
    applicable, and private pay rates. Expenses for these facilities
    are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities,
    taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from
    government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under
    pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.
    Liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for
    our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues

and/or

any
    increase in operating expenses result in a property not
    generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our
    operator and the value of other collateral would have to be
    relied upon.

Risk
    factors related to obligor bankruptcies

We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to
    meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,
    which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that
    an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency
    proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease
    agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand
    immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our
    loans



provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation,
    demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest,
    foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the
    bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party
    that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An obligor in
    bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to
    limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of
    a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case
    of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies.

We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate
    taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment
    property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property

and/or

transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we
    have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property
    to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided
    working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new
    obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new
    tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may
    expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events
    occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely
    affected.

Transfers
    of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and
    these facilities may not have efficient alternative
    uses

Transfers of health care facilities to successor operators may
    be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for
    transfers of other types of real estate. The replacement of an
    operator could be delayed by the approval process of any
    federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the
    facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage
    the facility. Alternatively, given the specialized nature of our
    facilities, we may be required to spend substantial time and
    funds to adapt these properties to other uses. If we are unable
    to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find
    efficient alternative uses, our revenue and operations may be
    adversely affected.

Risk
    factors related to government regulations

Our obligors’ businesses are affected by government
    reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that an
    operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues
    from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such
    revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,
    retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments
    or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,
    payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries, government
    funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to
    specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments due
    to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such
    property. In recent years, governmental payors have frozen or
    reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary
    pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be
    of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We
    cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect
    any future legislative reforms may have on the financial
    condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no
    assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be
    available for services provided by any property operator,
    whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare,
    Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of
    services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could
    have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity,
    financial condition and results of operations, which could
    adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its
    obligations to us. See “Item 1 —
    Business — Certain Government Regulations —
    Reimbursement” above.

Our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive
    federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection
    laws and regulations. Our operators’ or tenants’
    failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of
    accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines,
    suspension or decertification from federal and state health care
    programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such
    actions may have an effect on our operators’ or
    tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and,
    therefore, adversely impact us.

Many of our medical properties may require a license

and/or

certificate of need to operate. Failure to obtain a license or
    certificate of need, or loss of a required license or
    certificate of need would prevent a facility from operating in
    the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events
    could materially adversely affect our operators’ or
    tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us. State and
    local laws also may regulate expansion, including the addition
    of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and
    the construction of health care facilities, by requiring a
    certificate of need or other similar approval.



Risk
    factors related to liability claims and insurance
    costs

Long-term care property operators (skilled nursing facilities,
    assisted living facilities, and independent living/continuing
    care retirement communities) have experienced substantial
    increases in both the number and size of patient care liability
    claims in recent years, particularly in the states of Texas and
    Florida. As a result, general and professional liability costs
    have increased and may continue to increase. Long-term care
    liability insurance rates are increasing nationwide because of
    large jury awards. Over the past four years, both Texas and
    Florida have adopted skilled nursing property liability laws
    that modify or limit tort damages. Despite some of these
    reforms, the long-term care industry overall continues to
    experience very high general and professional liability costs.
    Insurance companies have responded to this claims crisis by
    severely restricting their capacity to write long-term care
    general and professional liability policies. No assurances can
    be given that the climate for long-term care general and
    professional liability insurance will improve in any of the
    foregoing states or any other states where the property
    operators conduct business. Insurance companies may continue to
    reduce or stop writing general and professional liability
    policies for long-term care facilities. Thus, general and
    professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or
    very costly, which may adversely affect the property
    operators’ future operations, cash flows and financial
    condition, and may have a material adverse effect on the
    property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us.

Risk
    factors related to acquisitions

We are exposed to the risk that our future acquisitions may not
    prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated
    difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired
    properties, including contingent liabilities, and newly acquired
    properties might require significant management attention that
    would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree
    to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the
    project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure
    completion of the project. Moreover, if we issue equity
    securities or incur additional debt, or both, to finance future
    acquisitions, it may reduce our per share financial results.
    These costs may negatively affect our results of operations.

Risk
    factors related to environmental laws

Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of
    real estate may be required to respond to the presence or
    release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held
    liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that
    result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous
    substances. We may become liable to reimburse the government for
    damages and costs it incurs in connection with the
    contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person
    based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our
    tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition
    of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site
    assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to
    taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to
    meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we
    believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if
    environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we
    do not believe that any of our properties are subject to
    material environmental contamination. However, environmental
    liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur
    costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the
    business or financial condition of our obligors.

Risk
    factors related to facilities that require entrance
    fees

Certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of
    an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may
    be refundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are
    subject to substantial oversight by state regulators. As a
    result of this oversight, residents of these facilities may have
    a variety of rights, including, for example, the right to cancel
    their contracts within a specified period of time and certain
    lien rights. The oversight and rights of residents within these
    facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of
    the operators of such facilities and therefore may negatively
    impact us.



Risk
    factors related to facilities under construction or
    development

At any given time, we may be in the process of constructing one
    or more new facilities that ultimately will require a license
    before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended
    use. The operator also will need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid
    provider agreements or third party payor contracts. In the event
    that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary licensure,
    provider agreements on contracts  after the completion of
    construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn
    any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator
    obtains a license to operate the new facility and the necessary
    provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract
    with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate
    the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider
    agreements or contracts.

In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development
    and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain,
    or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use,
    building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and
    authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or
    our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be
    able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us
    unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may
    not be able to complete construction and

lease-up

of
    a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt
    service expense or construction costs.

Additionally, the time frame required for development,
    construction and

lease-up

of
    these properties means that we may have to wait years for
    significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash
    distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from
    operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to
    borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly
    developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow
    that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall
    financial performance.

In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property,
    we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of
    that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our
    investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates. If our
    financial projections with respect to a new property are
    inaccurate, and the property is unable to achieve the expected
    occupancy and rental rates, it may fail to perform as we
    expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs
    of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove
    to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our
    profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties
    not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may
    be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service
    associated with that property.

We do
    not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases, and if
    they do not, we may be unable to lease the properties on as
    favorable terms, or at all

We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases
    at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times
    through 2021. If these leases are not renewed, we would be
    required to find other tenants to occupy those properties. There
    can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable
    replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on
    terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would
    be able to lease those properties at all.

Our
    ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the
    loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground
    leases

We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by
    acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the
    building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in
    the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases.
    As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the
    possibility of losing the property upon termination of the
    ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.



Illiquidity
    of real estate investments could significantly impede our
    ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our
    properties

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to
    quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to
    changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No
    assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for
    any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons.
    Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance
    of our investments could adversely affect our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Risk
    factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds

From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the
    proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments
    on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,
    including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master
    leases or similar financial support arrangements. We must
    re-invest these proceeds, on a timely basis, in properties or in
    qualified short-term investments. We compete for real estate
    investments with a broad variety of potential investors. This
    competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our
    ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us.
    Delays in acquiring properties may negatively impact revenues
    and perhaps our ability to make distributions to stockholders.

Failure
    to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our
    management or increase our expenses

We have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively
    short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in
    the future. Our rapid growth has resulted in increased levels of
    responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions
    could place significant additional demands on, and require us to
    expand, our management, resources and personnel. Our failure to
    manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business
    and, in particular, our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows, which could negatively affect our
    ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our rapid growth
    could also increase our capital requirements, which may require
    us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur
    additional debt.

Other
    risk factors

We are also subject to a number of other risks. First, we might
    fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. We intend to
    operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe we
    have and will continue to operate in such a manner. Since REIT
    qualification requires us to meet a number of complex
    requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them,
    and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of
    federal taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the
    amount we could distribute to our stockholders. Also, if we were
    not a REIT, we would not be required to make distributions to
    stockholders since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends
    to stockholders amounting to at least the sum of (1) 85% of our
    REIT ordinary income for such year (other than capital gain that
    we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (2) any undistributed
    taxable income from preceding periods. See
    “Item 1 — Business —
    Taxation” for a discussion of the provisions of the
    Internal Revenue Code that apply to us and the effects of
    non-qualification.

Second, our Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
    Amended and Restated By-Laws contain anti-takeover provisions
    (staggered board provisions, restrictions on share ownership and
    transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements
    for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for
    or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the
    approval of our incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and
    agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could
    reduce the market value of our common stock.

Third, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we have
    entered into employment agreements with our executive officers,
    losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have an
    adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more
    than one would have a material adverse impact on our business.

Includes $0.3409 prorated dividend
    paid on December 28, 2006 in connection with the Windrose
    merger.

Our Board of Directors approved a new quarterly dividend rate of
    $0.66 per share of common stock per quarter, commencing
    with the May 2007 dividend. Our dividend policy is reviewed
    annually by the Board of Directors. The declaration and payment
    of quarterly dividends remains subject to the review and
    approval of the Board of Directors.

On September 29, 2003, we issued 1,060,000 shares of
    6% Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the
    consolidated financial statements of Health Care REIT, Inc. for
    the periods presented and should be read together with the notes
    thereto contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Other important factors are identified in
    “Item 1 — Business” and

Executive
    Overview

Business

Health Care REIT, Inc. is a self-administered, equity real
    estate investment trust that invests in the full spectrum of
    senior housing and health care real estate. Founded in 1970, we
    were the first REIT to invest exclusively in health care
    properties. The following table summarizes our portfolio as of

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and
    enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash
    dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase
    dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual
    increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To
    meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of
    senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our
    investment portfolio by property type, operator/tenant and
    geographic location.

Substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from
    operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest
    earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent
    our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are
    dependent upon our obligors’ continued ability to make
    contractual rent and interest payments to us. To the extent that
    our obligors experience operating difficulties and are unable to
    generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be
    a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our
    investments through a variety of methods determined by the type
    of property and operator/tenant. Our asset management process
    includes review of monthly financial statements for each
    property, periodic review of obligor credit, periodic property
    inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to
    licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other
    collateral. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a
    proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific
    data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain
    industry trends and risks. Through these asset management and
    research efforts, we are typically able to intervene at an early
    stage to address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the
    collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment.

In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we
    also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. We
    typically limit our investments to no more than 90% of the
    appraised value of a property.



Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by
    guaranties

and/or

letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically
    structured as master leases and loans are generally
    cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans,
    operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and
    its affiliates.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, rental income and
    interest income represented 93% and 6%, respectively, of total
    gross revenues (including discontinued operations).
    Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with
    either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures. Leases
    with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on
    a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to
    a collectibility assessment. Rental income related to leases
    with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our
    yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors,
    including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount
    outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate
    adjustments.

Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we
    anticipate investing in additional properties. New investments
    are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our
    unsecured lines of credit arrangements, internally generated
    cash and the proceeds from sales of real property. Our
    investments generate internal cash from rent and interest
    receipts and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent
    financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn
    under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements, is expected to
    be provided through a combination of public and private
    offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or
    assumption of secured debt. We believe our liquidity and various
    sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations,
    meet debt service obligations (both principal and interest),
    make dividend distributions and finance future investments.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new
    investments will be available in the future with spreads over
    our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to
    our stockholders. We expect to complete gross new investments of
    $1,000,000,000 to $1,200,000,000 in 2007, including acquisitions
    of $700,000,000 to $800,000,000 and funded new development of
    $300,000,000 to $400,000,000. We anticipate the sale of real
    property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling
    approximately $100,000,000 to $200,000,000 during 2007. It is
    possible that additional loan repayments or sales of real
    property may occur in the future. To the extent that loan
    repayments and real property sales exceed new investments, our
    revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely
    affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any loan
    repayments and real property sales in new investments. To the
    extent that new investment requirements exceed our available
    cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured lines of
    credit arrangements. At December 31, 2006, we had
    $36,216,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $515,000,000 of
    available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements. Our investment activity may exceed our borrowing
    capacity under our unsecured lines of credit. To the extent that
    we are unable to issue equity or debt securities to provide
    additional capital, we may not be able to fund all of our
    potential investments, which could have an adverse effect on our
    revenues and cash flows from operations.

Key
    Transactions in 2006

We completed the following key transactions during the year
    ended December 31, 2006:

•

our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to
    $0.64 per share, which represented a two cent increase from
    the quarterly dividend of $0.62 paid for 2005. The dividend
    declared for the quarter ended December 31, 2006
    represented the 143rd consecutive dividend payment;

•

we completed a $1.0 billion merger with Windrose Medical
    Properties Trust on December 20, 2006;

•

we completed $559,209,000 of gross investments offset by
    $140,791,000 of investment payoffs;

•

we completed a public offering of 3,222,800 shares of
    common stock with net proceeds of approximately $109,749,000 in
    April 2006;

•

we extended our $40,000,000 unsecured line of credit which
    matured in May 2006 to May 2007 and reduced pricing by
    40 basis points;

•

we closed on a $700,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility
    to replace our $500,000,000 facility, which was scheduled to
    mature in June 2008. Among other things, the new facility
    provides us with additional



financial flexibility and borrowing capacity, extends our
    agreement to July 2009 and adds two new lenders to the bank
    group in addition to commitment increases by eight of the ten
    existing lenders; and

•

we issued $345,000,000 of 4.75% convertible notes due
    December 2026 in November and December 2006.

Windrose
    Medical Properties Trust Merger

On December 20, 2006, we completed our merger with Windrose
    Medical Properties Trust, a self-managed real estate investment
    trust based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The aggregate purchase
    price was approximately $1,018,345,000, including direct
    acquisition costs of approximately $29,918,000. The Windrose
    merger diversified our portfolio of investments throughout the
    health care delivery system. Windrose shareholders received
    approximately 9,679,000 shares of our common stock (valued
    at $41.00 per share) and Windrose preferred shareholders
    received 2,100,000 shares of our 7.5% Series G
    Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (valued at
    $29.58 per share). Additionally, our investment in Windrose
    includes $183,139,000 of cash provided to Windrose to extinguish
    secured debt, the assumption of $301,641,000 of debt and the
    assumption of other liabilities and minority interests totaling
    $44,683,000. The results of operations for Windrose have been
    included in our consolidated results of operations from the date
    of acquisition.

Key
    Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties

We utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the
    various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed
    below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and
    concentration risk. Management uses these key performance
    indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to
    our historical operating results, in making operating decisions
    and for budget planning purposes.

Operating Performance.

We believe that net
    income available to common stockholders (“NICS”) is
    the most appropriate earnings measure. Other useful supplemental
    measures of our operating performance include funds from
    operations (“FFO”) and funds available for
    distribution (“FAD”); however, these supplemental
    measures are not defined by U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principals (“U.S. GAAP”). Please refer
    to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures” for further discussion of FFO and FAD and for
    reconciliations of FFO and FAD to NICS. These earning measures
    and their relative per share amounts are widely used by
    investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and
    investment recommendations of REITs. The following table
    reflects the recent historical trends of our operating
    performance measures (in thousands, except per share data):

Credit Strength.

We measure our credit
    strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios.
    Our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization, debt to
    gross assets and debt to market capitalization. The leverage
    ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is
    related to long-term debt. Our coverage ratios include interest
    coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio. The coverage
    ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed
    charges (interest plus preferred dividends and secured debt
    principal amortizations). We expect to maintain capitalization
    ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain investment
    grade ratings with Moody’s Investors Service,
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch
    Ratings. The coverage ratios are based on earnings before
    interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    (“EBITDA”) which is discussed in further detail, and
    reconciled to net income, below in “Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures.” Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are



widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the
    valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of
    companies. The following table reflects the recent historical
    trends for our credit strength measures:

Concentration Risk.

We evaluate our
    concentration risk in terms of asset mix, investment mix,
    customer mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a
    valuable measure in understanding what portion of our
    investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to
    experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our
    investments that are real property. In order to qualify as an
    equity REIT, at least 75% of our real estate investments must be
    real property whereby each property, which includes the land,
    buildings, improvements, intangibles and related rights, is
    owned by us and leased to an operator pursuant to a long-term
    operating lease. Investment mix measures the portion of our
    investments that relate to our various property types. Customer
    mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our
    top five customers. The following table reflects our recent
    historical trends of concentration risk:

(1)

As a result of our significant
    independent living/continuing care retirement community
    acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2005, we began to
    separately disclose this property classification in our
    portfolio reporting. We adopted the National Investment Center
    definitions and reclassified certain of our existing facilities
    to this classification.

(2)

In September 2005, Alterra
    Healthcare Corporation, one of our tenants, became an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookdale Senior Living Inc. as a
    result of Brookdale’s merger with FEBC-ALT Investors LLC.
    In April 2006, Brookdale completed the acquisition of Southern
    Assisted Living, Inc.

We evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with
    current expectations to determine if historical trends are
    indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be
    achieved and actual results may differ materially from our
    expectations. Management regularly monitors various economic and
    other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed
    to improve performance and maximize our competitive position.
    Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent
    upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to
    appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific
    trends. Please refer to “Item 1A — Risk
    Factors” above for further discussion.

Portfolio
    Update

Investment
    Properties

Payment coverages of the operators in our investment property
    portfolio continue to improve. Our overall payment coverage is
    at 1.93 times and represents an increase of one basis point from
    2005 and 15 basis points from 2004. The following table
    reflects our recent historical trends of portfolio coverages.
    Coverage data reflects the 12 months ended for the periods

Operating
    Properties

Our consolidated financial results for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 include twelve days of revenues and
    expenses from operating properties due to the Windrose merger
    completed on December 20, 2006. The primary performance
    measure for our operating properties is net operating income
    (“NOI”) as discussed below in Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures. For the twelve days ended December 31, 2006, our
    operating properties generated $2,359,000 of net operating
    income which represents $3,474,000 of rental income less
    $1,115,000 of property operating expenses.

Corporate
    Governance

Maintaining investor confidence and trust has become
    increasingly important in today’s business environment.
    Our Board of Directors and management are strongly committed to
    policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of
    ethical business practices. Our corporate governance guidelines
    provide the framework for our business operations and emphasize
    our commitment to increase stockholder value while meeting all
    applicable legal requirements. The Board of Directors adopted
    and annually reviews its Corporate Governance Guidelines. These
    guidelines meet the listing standards adopted by the New York
    Stock Exchange and are available on our Web site at
    www.hcreit.com and from us upon written request sent to the
    Senior Vice President — Administration and Corporate
    Secretary, Health Care REIT, Inc., One SeaGate, Suite 1500,
    P.O. Box 1475, Toledo, Ohio,

43603-1475.



Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Sources
    and Uses of Cash

Our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts,
    borrowings under unsecured lines of credit arrangements, public
    and private offerings of debt and equity securities, proceeds
    from the sales of real property and principal payments on loans
    receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend
    distributions, debt service payments (including principal and
    interest), real property acquisitions, loan advances and general
    and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of cash are
    reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are
    discussed in further detail below.

Operating Activities.

The increases in net
    cash provided from operating activities are primarily
    attributable to increases in net income, excluding depreciation
    and amortization, stock-based compensation and net straight-line
    rental income. Net income and the provisions for depreciation
    and amortization increased primarily as a result of net new
    investments in properties owned by us. See the discussion of
    investing activities below for additional details. To the extent
    that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the
    future, our net income and provisions for depreciation and
    amortization will change accordingly.

Gross straight-line rental income represents the non-cash
    difference between contractual cash rent due and the average
    rent recognized pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 13

Accounting for Leases

(“SFAS 13”) for leases with fixed rental
    escalators, net of collectibility reserves, if any. This amount
    is positive in the first half of a lease term (but declining
    every year due to annual increases in cash rent due) and is
    negative in the second half of a lease term. The decrease in
    gross straight-line rental income is primarily due to annual
    increases in cash rent due on leases with fixed increases. The
    increase in non-recurring cash receipts is primarily
    attributable to cash received upon renegotiation of a lease in
    connection to the acquisition of Commonwealth Communities
    Holdings LLC by Kindred Healthcare, Inc. in February 2006.



Investing Activities.

The changes in net cash
    used in investing activities are primarily attributable to the
    Windrose merger and net changes in loans receivable and real
    property investments. The following is a summary of our
    investment and disposition activities, excluding the Windrose
    merger (dollars in thousands):

The investment in Windrose primarily represents $183,139,000 of
    cash provided to Windrose to extinguish secured debt and cash
    used to pay advisory fees, lender consents and other
    merger-related costs totaling $15,301,000. These cash uses have
    been offset by $15,591,000 of cash assumed from Windrose on the
    merger effective date.



Financing Activities.

The changes in net cash
    provided from or used in financing activities are primarily
    attributable to changes related to our long-term debt, common
    stock issuances, preferred stock issuances and cash
    distributions to stockholders.

We repaid $40,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes upon
    maturity in April 2004. In May 2005, we redeemed all of our
    outstanding $50,000,000 8.17% senior unsecured notes due March
    2006, we completed a public tender offer for $57,670,000 of our
    outstanding $100,000,000 7.625% senior unsecured notes due
    March 2008, and we redeemed $122,500,000 of our outstanding
    $175,000,000 7.5% senior unsecured notes due August 2007. The
    increase in principal payments on secured debt during 2005 is
    primarily due to early extinguishments of outstanding mortgages.
    During the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid off
    mortgages with outstanding balances of $72,309,000 and average
    interest rates of 7.481%.

The change in common stock is primarily attributable to public
    and private issuances and common stock issuances related to our
    dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan
    (“DRIP”). The remaining difference in common stock
    issuances is primarily due to issuances pursuant to stock
    incentive plans.

In September 2004, we closed on a public offering of
    7,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series F Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock, which generated net proceeds of
    approximately $169,107,000. The proceeds were used to repay
    borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements and
    to invest in additional properties.

In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (including
    100% of capital gains) to our stockholders. The increases in
    dividends are primarily attributable to increases in outstanding
    common and preferred stock shares as discussed above and
    increases in our annual common stock dividend per share and the
    payment of a prorated dividend of $0.3409 in December 2006 in
    conjunction with the Windrose merger.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit
    of certain insurance companies that provide workers’
    compensation insurance to one of our tenants. Our obligation
    under the letter of credit matures in 2009. At December 31,
    2006, our obligation under the letter of credit was $2,450,000.

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may or
    may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge
    interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on
    the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates, our
    perception of the future volatility of interest rates and our
    relative levels of variable rate debt and variable rate
    investments. As of December 31, 2006, we participated in
    two interest rate swap agreements related to our long-term debt.
    Our interest rate swaps are discussed below in “Contractual
    Obligations.”

We have a $52,215,000 liability to a subsidiary trust issuing
    trust preferred securities that was assumed in the Windrose
    merger. On March 24, 2006, Windrose’s wholly-owned
    subsidiary, Windrose Capital Trust I (the
    “Trust”), completed the issuance and sale in a private
    placement of $50,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of
    fixed/floating rate preferred securities. The trust preferred
    securities mature on March 30, 2036, are redeemable at our
    option beginning March 30, 2011, and require quarterly
    distributions of interest to the holders of the trust preferred
    securities. The trust preferred securities bear a fixed rate per
    annum equal to 7.22% through March 30, 2011, and a variable
    rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 2.05% thereafter.

The common stock of the Trust was purchased by an operating
    partnership of Windrose for $1,000,000. The Trust used the
    proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities
    together with the proceeds from the sale of the common stock to
    purchase $51,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of unsecured
    fixed/floating junior subordinated notes due March 30, 2036
    issued by an operating partnership. The operating partnership
    received approximately $49,000,000 in net proceeds, after the
    payment of fees and expenses, from the sale of the junior
    subordinated notes to the Trust. In accordance with FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities, we have not consolidated the trust because
    the operating partnership is not considered the primary
    beneficiary.

Unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements reflected at 100% capacity.

We have an unsecured credit arrangement with a consortium of
    twelve banks providing for a revolving line of credit
    (“revolving credit facility”) in the amount of
    $700,000,000, which expires on July 26, 2009 (with the
    ability to extend for one year at our discretion if we are in
    compliance with all covenants). The agreement specifies that
    borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to
    interest payable in periods no longer than three months at
    either the agent bank’s prime rate of interest or the
    applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate, at our option
    (6.275% at December 31, 2006). The applicable margin is
    based on our ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.9% at
    December 31, 2006. In addition, we pay a facility fee
    annually to each bank based on the bank’s commitment under
    the revolving credit facility. The facility fee depends on our
    ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.015%
    at December 31, 2006. We also pay an annual agent’s
    fee of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the
    agreement. We have another unsecured line of credit arrangement
    with a bank for a total of $40,000,000, which expires
    May 31, 2007. Borrowings under this line of credit are
    subject to interest at either the bank’s prime rate of
    interest (8.25% at December 31, 2006) or 0.9% over
    LIBOR interest rate, at our option. Principal is due upon
    expiration of the agreement. At December 31, 2006, we had
    $225,000,000 outstanding under the unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements and estimated total contractual interest
    obligations of $35,196,000. Contractual interest obligations are
    estimated based on the assumption that the balance of
    $225,000,000 at December 31, 2006 is constant until
    maturity at interest rates in effect at December 31, 2006.

We have $1,539,830,000 of senior unsecured notes principal
    outstanding with fixed annual interest rates ranging from 4.75%
    to 8.0%, payable semi-annually. Total contractual interest
    obligations on senior unsecured notes totaled $890,675,000 at
    December 31, 2006. Additionally, we have 63 mortgage
    loans totaling with total outstanding principal of $378,400,000,
    collateralized by owned properties, with annual interest rates
    ranging from 4.89% to 8.5%, payable monthly. The carrying values
    of the properties securing the mortgage loans totaled
    $559,513,000 at December 31, 2006. Total contractual
    interest obligations on mortgage loans totaled $146,427,000 at
    December 31, 2006.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
    of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
    debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps
    are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we
    utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The
    Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a
    fixed rate of 6% and pay a variable rate based on six-month



LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2006, total
    contractual interest obligations were estimated to be
    $42,490,000 at interest rates in effect at that time.

At December 31, 2006, we had operating lease obligations of
    $37,378,000 relating to our ground leases at certain of our
    properties and office space leases.

Purchase obligations are comprised of unfunded construction
    commitments and contingent purchase obligations. At
    December 31, 2006, we had outstanding construction
    financings of $138,222,000 for leased properties and were
    committed to providing additional financing of approximately
    $342,754,000 to complete construction. At December 31,
    2006, we had contingent purchase obligations totaling
    $32,282,000. These contingent purchase obligations primarily
    relate to deferred acquisition fundings and capital
    improvements. Deferred acquisition fundings are contingent upon
    a tenant satisfying certain conditions in the lease. Upon
    funding, amounts due from the tenant are increased to reflect
    the additional investment in the property.

Capital
    Structure

As of December 31, 2006, we had stockholders’ equity
    of $1,978,793,000 and a total outstanding debt balance of
    $2,198,001,000, which represents a debt to total book
    capitalization ratio of 53%. Our ratio of debt to market
    capitalization was 39% at December 31, 2006. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, our coverage ratio of EBITDA to
    interest was 2.97 to 1.00. For the year ended December 31,
    2006, our coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges was 2.39 to
    1.00. Also, at December 31, 2006, we had $36,216,000 of
    cash and cash equivalents and $515,000,000 of available
    borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require
    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth
    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
    create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of
    December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all of the
    covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements
    contain provisions for acceleration that could be triggered by
    our debt ratings. However, under our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used
    to determine the fees and interest payable.

Our senior unsecured notes are rated Baa3 (ratings watch
    positive), BBB- (stable) and BBB- (positive) by Moody’s
    Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services and Fitch Ratings, respectively. We plan to manage the
    Company to maintain investment grade status with a commensurate
    capital structure consistent with our current profile. Any
    downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the
    noted rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on
    our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a
    material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition.

On May 12, 2006, we filed an open-ended automatic or
    “universal” shelf registration statement with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission covering an indeterminate
    amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock,
    preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units. Also, as
    of February  16, 2007, we had an effective
    registration statement on file in connection with our enhanced
    DRIP program under which we may issue up to
    6,314,213 shares of common stock. As of February 16,
    2007, 1,101,020 shares of common stock remained available
    for issuance under this registration statement. Depending upon
    market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our
    registration statements to invest in additional properties and
    to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements.

The increase in gross revenues is primarily attributable to
    increased rental income resulting from the acquisitions of new
    properties from which we receive rent. See the discussion of
    investing activities in “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” above for further information. Certain of our
    leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon
    changes in the Consumer Price Index

and/or

changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s
    properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line
    rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on
    the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. While
    this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay
    dividends, it is anticipated that we will generate additional
    organic growth and minimize non-cash straight-line rent over
    time. If gross operating revenues at our facilities

and/or

the
    Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues
    may not continue to increase. Sales of real property would
    offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new
    acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues. Our leases
    could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an
    increase or decrease in rental income.

Interest income decreased in 2006 primarily due to recognition
    of additional interest income of approximately $4,523,000 in
    2005. The additional interest income related to the payoffs of
    loans that were either on non-accrual or partial accrual and all
    contractual interest was received from the borrowers. The
    decrease from 2004 to 2006 is primarily due to the decrease in
    outstanding loans receivable from $258,734,000 at
    December 31, 2003 to $194,448,000 at December 31, 2006.

The increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to
    increases in interest expense and the provisions for
    depreciation and amortization offset by the recognition of
    losses on extinguishment of debt in 2005. The increases in
    interest expense are primarily due to higher average borrowings
    and changes in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting
    interest expense. If we borrow under our unsecured lines of
    credit arrangements, issue additional senior unsecured notes or
    assume additional secured debt, our interest expense will
    increase.

We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used
    to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us.
    The amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding
    during the construction period using the rate of interest that
    approximates our cost of financing. Our interest expense is
    reduced by the amount capitalized. Capitalized interest for the
    years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 totaled
    $875,000, $665,000 and $4,470,000, respectively.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
    of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
    debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. We receive
    a fixed rate of 6.0% and pay a variable rate based on six-month
    LIBOR plus a spread. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    we incurred $197,000 of losses related to our Swaps that was
    recorded as an addition to interest expense. For the years ended
    December 31, 2005, and 2004, we generated $972,000 and
    $1,770,000, respectively, of savings related to our Swaps that
    was recorded as a reduction of interest expense.

Property operating expenses represent 12 days of expenses
    in 2006 related to Windrose’s operating properties acquired
    on December 20, 2006. These expenses include ground leases,
    property taxes and other expenses not reimbursed by tenants.

Depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of
    additional investments in properties owned directly by us. See
    the discussion of investing activities in “Liquidity and
    Capital Resources” above for further information. To the
    extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in
    the future, our provision for depreciation will change
    accordingly.

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues
    (including discontinued operations) for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, were 8.27% as compared with 5.89% and
    6.54% for the same periods in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
    2006 increase is directly attributable to $5,213,000 of merger
    related expenses and $1,287,000 of accelerated stock-based
    compensation expenses. The change from 2004 to 2005 is due to
    increased costs to attract and retain appropriate personnel to
    achieve our business objectives offset by a decrease in
    professional service fees and other operating costs as a result
    of focused expense control.

The change in loan expense was primarily due to increased costs
    in 2006 related to amending our primary unsecured line of credit
    arrangement and costs related to the issuance of senior
    unsecured notes.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, it was determined
    that the projected undiscounted cash flows from one of our
    properties did not exceed its related net book value and an
    impairment charge of $314,000 was recorded to reduce the
    property to its estimated fair market value. The estimated fair
    market value of the property was determined by an independent
    appraisal. We did not record any impairment charges for the
    years ended December 31, 2005 or December 31, 2006.

The provision for loan losses is related to our critical
    accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is
    discussed below in “Critical Accounting Policies.”

Three assisted living facilities were held for sale at
    December 31, 2006 and were sold subsequent to year-end.
    During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, we
    sold properties with carrying values of $37,710,000, $88,098,000
    and $75,989,000 for net losses of $143,000 and net gains of
    $3,227,000 and $1,267,000, respectively.



In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 144, we have reclassified the income and expenses
    attributable to the properties sold subsequent to
    January 1, 2002 and attributable to assets held for sale at
    December 31, 2006 to discontinued operations. These
    properties generated $3,306,000 and $1,213,000 of income after
    deducting depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue
    for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005,
    respectively and a loss of $2,021,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. Please refer to Note 16 of our
    audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

The increase in preferred dividends is primarily due to the
    increase in average outstanding preferred shares. The following

In conjunction with the acquisition of Windrose Medical
    Properties Trust in December 2006, we issued
    2,100,000 shares of 7.5% Series G Cumulative
    Convertible Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation
    value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly in
    arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity, may
    be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per
    share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to the
    redemption date, on or after June 30, 2010. Each
    Series G Preferred Share is convertible by the holder into
    our common stock at a conversion price of $34.93, equivalent to
    a conversion rate of 0.7157 common shares per Series G
    Preferred Share. These shares were recorded at $29.58 per share,
    which was deemed to be the fair value at the date of issuance.

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures

We believe that net income available to common stockholders, as
    defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings
    measurement. However, we consider FFO and FAD to be useful
    supplemental measures of our operating performance. Historical
    cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate
    assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the
    provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values
    have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many
    industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of
    operating results for real estate companies that use historical
    cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National
    Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
    (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental measure of
    operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost
    depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means
    net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
    excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus
    depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FAD represents
    FFO excluding the net straight-line rental adjustments, rental
    income related to above/below market leases and amortization of
    deferred loan expenses and less cash used to fund capital
    expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
    Statement No. 145 that requires gains and losses on
    extinguishment of debt to be classified as income or loss from
    continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as
    previously required under Statement No. 4. We adopted the
    standard effective January 1, 2003 and have properly
    reflected the $21,484,000, or $0.39 per diluted share, of
    losses on extinguishment of debt for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. These charges have not been added back
    for the calculations of FFO, FAD or EBITDA.

In October 2003, NAREIT informed its member companies that the
    SEC had changed its position on certain aspects of the NAREIT
    FFO definition, including impairment charges. Previously, the
    SEC accepted NAREIT’s view that impairment charges were
    effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an
    impending sale of



property and thus should be added back to net income in the
    calculation of FFO and FAD similar to other gains and losses on
    sales. However, the SEC’s clarified interpretation is that
    recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added
    back to net income in the calculation of FFO and FAD. We have
    adopted this interpretation and have not added back impairment
    charges of $314,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, recorded
    for the year ended December 31, 2004.

EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization. We believe that EBITDA, along with net income
    and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an
    important supplemental measure because it provides additional
    information to assess and evaluate the performance of our
    operations. Additionally, restrictive covenants in our long-term
    debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on EBITDA. We
    primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio,
    which represents EBITDA divided by total interest, and our fixed
    charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by fixed
    charges. Fixed charges include total interest, secured debt
    principal amortization and preferred dividends.

FFO, FAD and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used
    by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in
    the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations
    of companies. Management uses these financial measures to
    facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical
    operating results and in making operating decisions.
    Additionally, FFO and FAD are utilized by the Board of Directors
    to evaluate management. FFO, FAD and EBITDA do not represent net
    income or cash flow provided from operating activities as
    determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be
    considered as alternative measures of profitability or
    liquidity. Finally, FFO, FAD and EBITDA, as defined by us, may
    not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other
    real estate investment trusts or other companies.

Net operating income (“NOI”) is used to evaluate the
    operating performance of certain real estate properties such as
    medical office buildings. We define NOI as rental revenues,
    including tenant reimbursements, less property level operating
    expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, general
    and administrative expenses, impairments, interest expense and
    discontinued operations. We believe NOI provides investors
    relevant and useful information because it measures the
    operating performance of our medical office buildings at the
    property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to make
    decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property
    level performance of our medical office buildings.

The table below reflects the reconciliation of FFO to net income
    available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable
    U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented. The
    provisions for depreciation and amortization includes provisions
    for depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations.
    Amounts are in thousands except for per share data.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
    with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and
    assumptions. Management considers an accounting estimate or
    assumption critical if:

•

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to
    the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for
    highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters
    to change; and

•

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial
    condition or operating performance is material.



Management has discussed the development and selection of its
    critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
    disclosure presented below relating to them. Management believes
    the current assumptions and other considerations used to
    estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial
    statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to
    change in the future. However, since these estimates require
    assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the
    estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual
    experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations
    used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated
    financial statements, the resulting changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
    operations, liquidity

and/or

financial condition. Please refer to Note 1 of our audited
    consolidated financial statements for further information on
    significant accounting policies that impact us. There were no
    material changes to these policies in 2006.

We adopted the fair value-based method of accounting for
    share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the
    prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148,
    Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition
    and Disclosure. Because Statement 123(R) must be applied
    not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are
    not fully vested on the effective date of Statement 123(R),
    and because we adopted Statement 123 using the prospective
    transition method (which applied only to awards granted,
    modified or settled after the adoption date of
    Statement 123), compensation cost for some previously
    granted awards that were not recognized under Statement 123
    has been recognized under Statement 123(R). Additionally,
    we amortize compensation cost for share based payments to the
    date that the awards become fully vested or to the expected
    retirement date, if sooner. Effective with the adoption of
    Statement 123(R) we began recognizing compensation cost to
    the date the awards become fully vested or to the retirement
    eligible date, if sooner. Had we adopted Statement 123(R)
    in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have
    approximated the impact of Statement 123 as described in
    the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share to
    our audited consolidated financial statements. The adoption of
    Statement 123(R) increased compensation cost by
    approximately $1,287,000 for 2006 as a result of amortizing
    share based awards to the retirement eligible date.

The following table presents information about our critical
    accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to
    develop each estimate:

Nature of Critical

Assumptions/

Accounting Estimate

Approach Used

Allowance for Loan
    Losses

We maintain an allowance for loan
    losses in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
    Loan, as amended, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
    No. 102, Selected Loan Loss Allowance Methodology and
    Documentation Issues. The allowance for loan losses is
    maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential
    losses in our loans receivable. The determination of the
    allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding
    loans. If this evaluation indicates that there is a greater risk
    of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on
    non-accrual status may be required. A loan is impaired when,
    based on current information and events, it is probable that we
    will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according
    to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement.
    Consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are
    deemed impaired. To the extent circumstances improve and the
    risk of collectibility is diminished, we will return these loans
    to full accrual status.

The determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectibility of loan payments and principal. We evaluate the collectibility of our loans receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, historical loan charge-offs, financial
strength of the borrower and guarantors and value of the underlying property or other collateral.

For the year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded $1,000,000 as provision for loan losses, resulting in an allowance for loan losses of $7,406,000 relating to loans with outstanding balances of $78,113,000 at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, we had loans with outstanding balances of $10,529,000
on non- accrual status.

Depreciation and
    Amortization and Useful
    Lives

Substantially all of the properties
    owned by us are leased under operating leases and are recorded
    at cost. The cost of our real property is allocated to land,
    buildings, improvements and intangibles in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
    Business Combinations. The allocation of the acquisition costs
    of properties is based on appraisals commissioned from
    independent real estate appraisal firms.

We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40 years for buildings, five to 15 years for improvements and five years for intangibles.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $79,284,000, $17,955,000 and $325,000 as provisions for depreciation and
amortization relating to buildings, improvements and intangibles, respectively, including amounts reclassified as discontinued

operations. The average useful
    life of our buildings and improvements was 32.1 years and
    11.5 years, respectively, at December 31, 2006. The
    amortization of lease intangibles represents 12 days of
    amortization expenses due to the Windrose merger on
    December 20, 2006.

Impairment of Long-Lived
    Assets

We review our long-lived assets for
    potential impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
    and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. An impairment charge must be
    recognized when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not
    recoverable. The carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds
    the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
    the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is
    determined that a permanent impairment of a long-lived asset has
    occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair
    value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference
    between the carrying value and the fair value.

The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment. These indicators may include anticipated operating losses at the property level, the tenant’s inability to make rent payments, a decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and changes in the
market that may permanently reduce the value of the property. If indicators of impairment exist, then the undiscounted future cash flows from the most likely use of the property are compared to the current net book value. This analysis requires us to determine if indicators of impairment exist and to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows to be generated from the property during the period the
property is expected to be held.

We did not record any impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Fair Value of Derivative
    Instruments

The valuation of derivative
    instruments is accounted for in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
    (‘SFAS133”), as amended by Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain
    Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. SFAS133,
    as amended, requires companies to record derivatives at fair
    market value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities.

The valuation of derivative
    instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values for our
    derivatives are estimated by a third party consultant, which
    utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and
    discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts
    are subject to significant estimates which may change in the
    future. At December 31, 2006, we participated in two
    interest rate swap agreements related to our long-term debt. At
    December 31, 2006, the swaps were reported at their fair
    value as a $902,000 other asset. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, we incurred $197,000 of losses related
    to our swaps that was recorded as an addition to interest
    expense.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recorded in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13,
    Accounting for Leases, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
    No. 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as
    amended (‘SAB104‘). SAB104 requires that revenue be
    recognized after four basic criteria are met. These four
    criteria include persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the
    rendering of service, fixed and determinable income and
    reasonably assured collectibility. If the collectibility of
    revenue is determined incorrectly, the amount and timing of our
    reported revenue could be significantly affected. Interest
    income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal
    amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectibility
    risk. Substantially all of our operating leases contain either
    fixed or contingent escalating rent structure. Leases with fixed
    annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-
    line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a
    collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with
    contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the
    contractual cash rental payments due for the period.

We evaluate the collectibility of our revenues and related receivables on an on-going basis. We evaluate collectibility based on assumptions and other considerations including, but not limited to, the certainty of payment, payment history, the financial strength of the investment’s underlying operations as measured by cash flows and payment coverages, the value of
the underlying collateral and guaranties and current economic conditions.

If our evaluation indicates that collectibility is not reasonably assured, we may place an investment on non-accrual or reserve against all or a portion of current income as an offset to revenue.

For the year ended December 31, 2006 we recognized $18,829,000 of interest income and $305,635,000 of rental income,
including discontinued operations. Cash receipts on leases with deferred revenue provisions were $20,561,000 as compared to gross straight-line rental income recognized of $9,432,000. At December 31, 2006, our straight-line receivable balance was $53,281,000, net of reserves totaling $5,902,000. Also at December 31, 2006, we had loans with outstanding balances of $10,529,000 on non-accrual status.

Impact of
    Inflation

During the past three years, inflation has not significantly
    affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate.
    Additionally, our earnings are primarily long-term investments
    with fixed rates of return. These investments are mainly
    financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes
    and borrowings under our



unsecured lines of credit arrangements. During inflationary
    periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest
    rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the
    yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new
    borrowing costs. Presuming the current inflation rate remains
    moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase
    significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the
    availability of equity and debt financing for us.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We seek to
    mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by
    matching the terms of new investments with new long-term fixed
    rate borrowings to the extent possible. We may or may not elect
    to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate
    exposure. These decisions are principally based on our policy to
    fund our fixed rate investments with long-term fixed rate debt
    and equity, but are also based on the general trend in interest
    rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future
    volatility of interest rates. The following section is presented
    to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential
    fluctuations in interest rates.

We historically borrow on our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements to acquire, construct or make loans relating to
    health care and senior housing properties. Then, as market
    conditions dictate, we will issue equity or long-term fixed rate
    debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements.

A change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense
    associated with our fixed rate debt. Interest rate changes,
    however, will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt. At
    December 31, 2006, we had $1,539,830,000 of outstanding
    principal balances related to our senior unsecured notes. A 1%
    increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair
    value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately $71,108,000
    at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2005, we had
    $1,194,830,000 of outstanding principal balances related to our
    senior unsecured notes. A 1% increase in interest rates would
    result in a decrease in fair value of our senior unsecured notes
    by approximately $36,770,000 at December 31, 2005. At
    December 31, 2006, we had $363,848,000 of outstanding
    principal balances related to our fixed rate secured debt. A 1%
    increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair
    value of our fixed rate secured debt by approximately
    $17,214,000 at December 31, 2006. At December 31,
    2005, we had $107,540,000 of outstanding principal balances
    related to our fixed rate secured debt. A 1% increase in
    interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our
    fixed rate secured debt by approximately $3,962,000 at
    December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had
    $51,000,000 of outstanding principal balances related to our
    liability to a subsidiary trust issuing preferred securities. A
    1% increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair
    value of this liability by approximately $1,891,000 at
    December 31, 2006. Changes in the interest rate environment
    upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on
    our future cash flows and earnings, depending on whether the
    debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt, variable rate debt
    or equity, or repaid by the sale of assets.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
    of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
    debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps
    are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we
    utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The
    Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a
    fixed rate of 6.0% and pay a variable rate based on six-month
    LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    Swaps were reported at their fair values as a $902,000 and
    $2,211,000 other asset, respectively. A 1% increase in interest
    rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our Swaps by
    approximately $4,659,000 and $6,435,000 at December 31,
    2006 and 2005.

Our variable rate debt, including our unsecured lines of credit
    arrangements and one mortgage loan, is reflected at fair value.
    At December 31, 2006, we had $239,552,000 outstanding
    related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in
    outstanding balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would
    result in increased annual interest expense of $2,396,000. At
    December 31, 2005, we had $195,000,000 outstanding related
    to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding
    balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would have resulted in
    increased annual interest expense of $1,950,000.



We are subject to risks associated with debt financing,
    including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be
    refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as
    favorable as the terms of current indebtedness. The majority of
    our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual
    agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.
    Accordingly, in the event that we are unable to raise additional
    equity or borrow money because of these limitations, our ability
    to acquire additional properties may be limited.

For additional information regarding fair values of financial
    instruments, see “Item 7 — Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Critical Accounting Policies” and
    Note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements.

Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Stockholders and Directors

Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Health Care REIT, Inc. as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedules listed in
    Item 15(a)(2) of this

Form 10-K.

These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility
    of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Health Care REIT, Inc. at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed
    its method of accounting for stock-based compensation to conform
    to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment.”

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Health Care REIT, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Accounting
    Policies and Related Matters

Industry

We are a self-administered, equity real estate investment trust
    that invests across the full spectrum of senior housing and
    health care real estate including skilled nursing facilities,
    independent living facilities/continuing care retirement
    communities, assisted living facilities, hospitals, long-term
    acute care hospitals and medical office buildings.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries after the
    elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
    reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and SEC
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition
    in Financial Statements, as amended (“SAB 104”).
    SAB 104 requires that revenue be recognized after four
    basic criteria are met. These four criteria include persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and
    determinable income and reasonably assured collectibility.
    Interest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the
    principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of
    collectibility risk. Substantially all of our operating leases
    contain either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures.
    Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease
    period, subject to a collectibility assessment. Rental income
    related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally
    recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for
    the period.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid
    investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

Loans
    Receivable

Loans receivable consist of mortgage loans, construction loans
    and working capital loans. Interest income on loans is
    recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding
    subject to an evaluation of collectibility risks. The mortgage
    loans and construction loans are primarily collateralized by a
    first or second mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage on, or an
    assignment of the partnership interest in, the related
    properties. Working capital loans are generally either unsecured
    or secured by the operator’s leasehold rights, corporate
    guaranties

and/or

personal guaranties.

Allowance
    for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed
    adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The
    determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly
    evaluation of these loans, including general economic conditions
    and estimated collectibility of loan payments. We evaluate the
    collectibility of our loans receivable based on a combination of
    factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status,
    historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower
    and guarantors and value of the underlying collateral. If such
    factors



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

indicate that there is greater risk of loan charge-offs,
    additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be
    required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information
    and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all
    amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of
    the original loan agreement. Consistent with this definition,
    all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. At
    December 31, 2006, we had loans with outstanding balances
    of $10,529,000 on non-accrual status ($16,770,000 at
    December 31, 2005). To the extent circumstances improve and
    the risk of collectibility is diminished, we will return these
    loans to full accrual status. While a loan is on non-accrual
    status, any cash receipts are applied against the outstanding
    balance.

Real
    Property Owned

Real property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the
    capitalization of construction period interest. The cost of real
    property acquired is allocated to net tangible and identifiable
    intangible assets based on their respective fair values in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 141, Business Combinations. The allocation of the
    acquisition costs of tangible assets (land, building and
    equipment) is based on appraisals commissioned from independent
    real estate appraisal firms. Substantially all of the properties
    owned by us are leased under operating leases and are recorded
    at cost. These properties are depreciated on a straight-line
    basis over their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to
    40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for
    improvements.

The remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable
    intangible assets primarily consisting of the above or below
    market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place
    leases.

The value allocable to the above or below market component of
    the acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present
    value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated
    with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the
    contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its
    remaining term, and (ii) management’s estimate of the
    amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the
    remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above
    market leases are included in acquired lease intangibles and
    below market leases are included in other liabilities in the
    balance sheet and are amortized to rental income over the
    remaining terms of the respective leases.

The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further
    allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship
    values based on management’s evaluation of the specific
    characteristics of each tenant’s lease and the
    Company’s overall relationship with that respective tenant.
    Characteristics considered by management in allocating these
    values include the nature and extent of the Company’s
    existing business relationships with the tenant, growth
    prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the
    tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals,
    among other factors. The estimated aggregate amortization
    expense for acquired lease intangibles is approximately
    $16,816,000 for each of the next five years.

The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on
    a property by property basis to determine if facts and
    circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that
    the depreciable life may need to be changed. We consider
    external factors relating to each asset. If these external
    factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of the asset
    over the remaining depreciation period indicate that the asset
    will not be recoverable, the carrying value may be reduced to
    the estimated fair market value.

Capitalization
    of Construction Period Interest

We capitalize interest costs associated with funds used to
    finance the construction of properties owned directly by us. The
    amount capitalized is based upon the balance outstanding during
    the construction period using the rate of interest which
    approximates our cost of financing. We capitalized interest
    costs of $4,470,000, $665,000, and $875,000, during 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively, related to construction of real property
    owned by us. Our interest expense reflected in the consolidated
    statements of income has been reduced by the amounts capitalized.



HEALTH

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Deferred
    Loan Expenses

Deferred loan expenses are costs incurred by us in connection
    with the issuance, assumption and amendments of short-term and
    long-term debt. We amortize these costs over the term of the
    debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the
    interest yield method.

Equity
    Investments

Equity investments consist of investments in private companies
    where we do not have the ability to exercise influence and are
    accounted for under the cost method. Under the cost method of
    accounting, investments in private companies are carried at cost
    and are adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value, distributions of earnings and additional
    investments. For investments in public companies, if any that
    have readily determinable fair market values, we classify our
    equity investments as

available-for-sale

and, accordingly, record these investments at their fair market
    values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income, a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. These investments represent a minimal
    ownership interest in these companies. In connection with the
    Windrose merger, we assumed a $1,000,000 investment in an
    unconsolidated subsidiary that holds trust preferred securities
    and is accounted for under the cost method.

Segment
    Reporting

We report consolidated financial statements in accordance with
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 131,
    Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information. Segments are based on our method of internal
    reporting which classifies operations by leasing activities. Our
    segments include investment properties and operating properties.
    See Note 18 for additional information.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

Accumulated other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains
    or losses on our equity investments and unrecognized actuarial
    losses from the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
    and Other Postretirement Plans — An amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) on December 31,
    2006. Accumulated unrealized gains and losses totaled $0, $0 and
    $1,000 at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
    and is included as a component of stockholders’ equity.

Fair
    Value of Derivative Instruments

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
    loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may or
    may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge
    interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on
    our policy to fund our fixed rate investments with long-term
    fixed rate debt and equity, but are also based on the general
    trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our
    perception of the future volatility of interest rates.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
    agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
    of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
    changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
    debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps
    are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we
    utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement
    No. 133, as amended. The Swaps are with highly rated
    counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 6.0% and pay
    a variable rate based on six-month LIBOR plus a spread. The
    hedging arrangement is considered highly effective and, as such,
    changes in the Swaps’ fair values exactly offset the
    corresponding changes in the fair value of senior unsecured
    notes and, as a result, the changes in fair value do not result
    in an impact on net income. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    the Swaps were reported at their fair value of $902,000 and
    $2,211,000, respectively, in other assets with an offsetting
    adjustment to the underlying senior unsecured notes. For the
    year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred $197,000 of
    losses related to the Swaps that was recorded as an addition to
    interest expense. For the years ended December 31,



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2005 and 2004, we generated $972,000 and $1,770,000,
    respectively, of savings related to the Swaps that was recorded
    as a reduction in interest expense.

The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
    instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are estimated by a
    third party consultant, which utilizes pricing models that
    consider forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts
    and the recognition of such amounts are subject to significant
    estimates that may change in the future.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
    of shares outstanding for the period adjusted for non-vested
    shares of restricted stock. The computation of diluted earnings
    per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that
    the number of shares is increased to include the number of
    additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
    potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

Federal
    Income Tax

No provision has been made for federal income taxes since we
    have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust
    under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
    and we believe that we have met the requirements for
    qualification as such for each taxable year. See Note 12.

New
    Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based
    Payment. See Note 9 for a discussion of our adoption of
    Statement 123(R) as of January 1, 2006.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158,
    Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
    Postretirement Plans — An amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). The statement requires
    employers to recognize the overfunded and underfunded portion of
    a defined benefit plan as an asset or liability, respectively,
    and any unrecognized gains and losses or prior service costs as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. It also
    requires that a plan’s funded status to be measured at the
    employer’s fiscal year-end. The new statement, which is
    effective as of December 31, 2006, increased accrued
    pension costs and accumulated other comprehensive loss by
    $135,000.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The Interpretation
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
    Taxes, and will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year
    2007. The interpretation prescribes guidance for recognizing,
    measuring, reporting and disclosing a tax position taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return. We are currently
    evaluating the effects the interpretation will have on our
    financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 157,
    Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
    accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. The statement will be effective for fiscal year
    2008. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a
    material impact on our financial position, although additional
    disclosures may be required.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No, 108. The guidance requires
    registrants to evaluate adjusting entries using both the
    roll-over method and the iron curtain method. Previously,
    registrants would use one method to perform their evaluation of
    an error’s materiality, even though their conclusion may be
    different under the other method. If an adjustment is deemed
    quantitatively and



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

qualitatively material to the financial statements under either
    method, correction of the error is required. The adoption of the
    guidance during the fourth quarter of 2006 did not have a
    material impact on our financial position.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform
    with the current year presentation.

Windrose
    Medical Properties Trust Merger

On December 20, 2006, we completed our merger with Windrose
    Medical Properties Trust, a self-managed real estate investment
    trust based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The aggregate purchase
    price was approximately $1,018,345,000, including direct
    acquisition costs of approximately $29,918,000. The Windrose
    merger diversified our portfolio of investments throughout the
    health care delivery system. Windrose shareholders received
    approximately 9,679,000 shares of our common stock (valued
    at $41.00 per share) and Windrose preferred shareholders
    received 2,100,000 shares of our 7.5% Series G
    Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (valued at
    $29.58 per share). Additionally, our investment in Windrose
    includes $183,139,000 of cash provided to Windrose to extinguish
    secured debt, the assumption of $301,641,000 of debt and the
    assumption of other liabilities and minority interests totaling
    $44,683,000. The total purchase price for Windrose has been
    allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and
    liabilities based upon their respective fair values. Such
    allocations have not been finalized and as such, the allocation
    of the purchase consideration included in the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006, is
    preliminary and subject to adjustment.

The following table presents the allocation of the purchase
    price, net of merger-related expenses and capitalized equity
    issuance costs of $5,213,000 and $912,000, respectively, to

    property that had previously been financed by the Company with
    loans in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We converted
    $24,330,000 and $29,238,000 of completed construction projects
    into operating lease properties in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    We acquired properties which included the assumption of
    mortgages totaling $274,473,000, $22,309,000 and $14,555,000 in
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Certain of our 2006 and 2005
    acquisitions included deferred acquisition payments totaling
    $2,000,000 and $18,125,000, respectively. These non-cash
    activities are appropriately not reflected in the accompanying
    statements of cash flows. See the accompanying statement of cash
    flows for non-cash investing activity related to the Windrose
    merger.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, it was determined
    that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did
    not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge
    of $314,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated
    fair market value. The estimated fair market value was
    determined by an offer to purchase received from a third party.
    We did not record any impairment charges during the years ended
    December 31, 2006 or 2005.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had $14,796,000 and
    $11,912,000, respectively, related to assets held for sale. See

Borrowings
    Under Lines of Credit Arrangements and Related Items

We have an unsecured credit arrangement with a consortium of
    twelve banks providing for a revolving line of credit
    (“revolving credit”) in the amount of $700,000,000,
    which expires on July 26, 2009 (with the ability to extend
    for one year at our discretion if we are in compliance with all
    covenants). The agreement specifies that borrowings under the
    revolving credit are subject to interest payable in periods no
    longer than three months at either the agent bank’s prime
    rate of interest (8.25% at December 31, 2006) or the
    applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate, at our option
    (6.275% at December 31, 2006). The applicable margin is
    based on our ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.9% at
    December 31, 2006. In addition, we pay a facility fee
    annually to each bank based on the bank’s commitment under
    the revolving credit facility. The facility fee depends on our
    ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and was 0.15%
    at December 31, 2006. We also pay an annual agent’s
    fee of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the
    agreement. We have another unsecured line of credit arrangement
    with a bank for a total of $40,000,000, which expires
    May 31, 2007. Borrowings under this line of credit are
    subject to interest at either the bank’s prime rate of
    interest (8.25% at December 31, 2006) or 0.9% over
    LIBOR interest rate (6.25% at December 31, 2006), at our
    option. Principal is due upon expiration of the agreement.

Senior
    Unsecured Notes and Secured Debt

We have $1,541,814,000 of senior unsecured notes with annual
    interest rates ranging from 4.75% to 8.00%. The carrying amounts
    of the senior unsecured notes represent the par value of
    $1,539,830,000 adjusted for any unamortized premiums or
    discounts and other basis adjustments related to hedging the
    debt with derivative instruments. See Note 1 for further
    discussion regarding derivative instruments.

In November and December 2006, we issued $345,000,000 of
    4.75% senior unsecured convertible notes due December 2026,
    generating net proceeds of $337,517,000. The notes will be
    convertible, in certain circumstances, into cash and, if
    applicable, shares of Health Care REIT’s common stock at an
    initial conversion rate of 20.8833 shares per $1,000 principal
    amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of
    approximately $47.89 per share. In general, upon conversion, the
    holder of each note would receive, in respect of the conversion
    value of such note, cash up to the principal amount of such note
    and Health Care REIT common stock for the note’s conversion
    value in excess of such principal amount.

We have 63 mortgage loans totaling $378,972,000,
    collateralized by owned properties with annual interest rates
    ranging from 4.89% to 8.50%. The carrying amounts of the
    mortgage loans represent the outstanding principal balance of
    $378,400,000 adjusted for any unamortized fair market value
    adjustments. The carrying values of the properties securing the
    mortgage loans totaled $559,513,000 at December 31, 2006.

We have a $52,215,000 liability to a subsidiary trust issuing
    trust preferred securities that was assumed in the Windrose
    merger. On March 24, 2006, Windrose’s wholly-owned
    subsidiary, Windrose Capital Trust I (the
    “Trust”), completed the issuance and sale in a private
    placement of $50,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of
    fixed/floating rate preferred securities. The trust preferred
    securities mature on March 30, 2036, are redeemable at our
    option beginning March 30, 2011, and require quarterly
    distributions of interest to the holders of the trust preferred
    securities. The trust preferred securities bear a fixed rate per
    annum equal to 7.22% through March 30, 2011, and a variable
    rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 2.05% thereafter.

The common stock of the Trust was purchased by an operating
    partnership of Windrose for $1,000,000. The Trust used the
    proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities
    together with the proceeds from the sale of the common stock to
    purchase $51,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of unsecured
    fixed/floating junior subordinated notes due March 30, 2036
    issued by an operating partnership. The operating partnership
    received approximately $49,000,000 in net proceeds, after the
    payment of fees and expenses, from the sale of the junior
    subordinated notes to the Trust. In accordance with FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities, we have not consolidated the trust because
    the operating partnership is not considered the primary
    beneficiary.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require
    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth
    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
    create liens and make investments or acquisitions.

Stock
    Incentive Plans

Our 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizes up to
    2,200,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the
    discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. The 2005 Plan replaced the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan
    and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The options
    granted to officers and key salaried employees under the 1995
    Plan continue to vest through 2015 and expire ten years from the
    date of grant. Our non-employee directors, officers and key
    salaried employees are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan.
    The 2005 Plan allows for the issuance of, among other things,
    stock options, restricted stock, deferred stock units and
    dividend equivalent rights.

    fair values than options without dividend equivalent rights.

Vesting periods for options and restricted shares range from
    three years for directors to five years for officers and key
    salaried employees. Options expire ten years from the date of
    grant. We granted 98,000, 85,000 and 112,000 restricted shares
    during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, including 13,000,
    16,000 and 10,000 shares to non-employee directors in 2006,

The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference

    quoted price of our common stock for the options that were

in-the-money

at December 31, 2006. During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the aggregate intrinsic value of options
    exercised under our stock incentive plans was $3,140,000
    determined as of the date of option exercise. During the year
    ended December 31, 2005, the aggregate intrinsic value of
    options exercised under our stock incentive plans was $4,705,000
    determined as of the date of option exercise. Cash received from
    option exercises under our stock incentive plans for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 was $4,872,000. Cash received from
    option exercises under our stock incentive plans for the year

As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $2,349,000
    of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested
    stock options granted under our stock incentive plans. That cost
    is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    three years. As of December 31, 2006, there was
    approximately $4,761,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested restricted stock granted under our stock
    incentive plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of three years.

We adopted the fair value-based method of accounting for
    share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the
    prospective method described in Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure. Currently,
    we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate
    the value of stock option grants and expect to continue to use
    this acceptable option valuation model. Because we adopted
    Statement No. 123 using the prospective transition method
    (which applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after
    the adoption date of Statement No. 123), compensation cost
    for some previously granted awards that were not recognized
    under Statement No. 123 will now be recognized effective
    with the adoption of Statement No. 123(R) on

    compensation cost for share-based payments to the date that the
    awards became fully vested or to the expected retirement date,
    if sooner. Effective with the adoption of Statement
    No.  123(R), we began recognizing compensation cost to
    the date the awards become fully vested or to the retirement
    eligible date, if sooner. Compensation cost totaled $6,980,000
    for the year ended December 31, 2006.

    be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per
    share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to the
    redemption date, on or after July 9, 2008.

In September 2003, we issued 1,060,000 shares of 6%
    Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred
    Stock as partial consideration for an acquisition of assets by
    the Company, with the shares valued at $26,500,000 for such
    purposes. The shares were issued to Southern Assisted Living,
    Inc. and certain of its stockholders without registration in
    reliance upon the federal statutory exemption of
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The
    shares have a liquidation value of $25.00 per share.
    Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock,
    which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us at a
    redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends on such shares to the redemption date, on or
    after August 15, 2008. The preferred shares are convertible
    into common stock at a conversion price of $32.66 per share
    at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2005,
    certain holders of our Series E Preferred Stock converted
    275,056 shares into 210,541 shares of our common
    stock, leaving 74,989 of such shares outstanding at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005.

In September 2004, we closed a public offering of
    7,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series F Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation
    value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly
    in arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity,
    may be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per
    share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to the
    redemption date, on or after September 14, 2009.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Windrose Medical
    Properties Trust in December 2006, we issued
    2,100,000 shares of 7.5% Series G Cumulative
    Convertible Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation
    value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly in
    arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity, may
    be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per
    share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to the
    redemption date, on or after June 30, 2010. Each
    Series G Preferred Share is convertible by the holder into
    our common stock at a conversion price of $34.93, equivalent to
    a conversion rate of 0.7157 common shares per Series G
    Preferred Share. The shares were recorded at $29.58 per share,
    which was deemed to be the fair value at the date of the
    issuance.

Income
    Taxes and Distributions

To qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income
    tax purposes, 90% of taxable income (including 100% of capital
    gains) must be distributed to stockholders. Real estate
    investment trusts that do not distribute a certain amount of
    current year taxable income in the current year are also subject
    to a 4% federal excise tax. The principal differences between
    undistributed net income for federal income tax purposes and
    financial statement purposes are the recognition of
    straight-line rent for reporting purposes, differing useful
    lives and depreciation and amortization methods for real
    property and the provision for loan losses for reporting
    purposes versus bad debt expense for tax purposes.

Cash distributions paid to common stockholders, for federal
    income tax purposes, are as follows:

Commitments
    and Contingencies

We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit
    of certain insurance companies that provide workers’
    compensation insurance to one of our tenants. Our obligation
    under the letter of credit matures in 2009. At December 31,
    2006, our obligation under the letter of credit was $2,450,000.

At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding construction
    financings of $138,222,000 for leased properties and were
    committed to providing additional financing of approximately
    $342,754,000 to complete construction. At December 31,
    2006, we had contingent purchase obligations totaling
    $32,282,000. These contingent purchase obligations primarily
    relate to deferred acquisition fundings and capital
    improvements. Deferred acquisition fundings are contingent upon
    an operator satisfying certain conditions such as payment
    coverage and value tests. Amounts due from the tenant are
    increased to reflect the additional investment in the property.

At December 31, 2006, we had operating lease obligations of
    $37,378,000 relating to certain ground leases and Company office
    space. We incurred rental expense relating to our Company office
    space of $939,000, $283,000 and $292,000 for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Regarding
    the property leases, we have sublease agreements with certain of
    our operators that require the operators to reimburse us for our
    monthly operating lease obligations. At December 31, 2006,
    aggregate future minimum rentals to be received under these
    noncancelable subleases totaled $12,982,000.

Disclosure
    about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it
    is practicable to estimate that value.

Mortgage Loans Receivable

— The fair value of
    all mortgage loans receivable is estimated by discounting the
    estimated future cash flows using the current rates at which
    similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit
    ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

Working Capital Loans and Construction Loans

—
    The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value based
    on the interest rates received, which approximates current
    market rates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The carrying amount
    approximates fair value.

Equity Investments

— Equity investments are
    recorded at their fair market value.

Borrowings Under Lines of Credit Arrangements

—
    The carrying amount of the lines of credit arrangements
    approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate
    adjustable.

Senior Unsecured Notes

— The fair value of the
    senior unsecured notes payable was estimated by discounting the
    estimated future cash flows using the current borrowing rate
    available to the Company for similar debt.

Mortgage Loans Payable

— Mortgage loans payable
    is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the interest
    rates paid, which approximates current market rates.



HEALTH
    CARE REIT, INC.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

— Our interest
    rate swap agreements are recorded as assets or liabilities on
    the balance sheet at fair market value. Fair market value is
    estimated by a third party consultant, which utilizes pricing
    models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates.

As a result of the merger with Windrose Properties Trust in

    we may make matching contributions and a profit sharing
    contribution. Our contributions to the Health Care REIT, Inc.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”), a non-qualified defined benefit pension
    plan, which provides certain executive officers with
    supplemental deferred retirement benefits. The SERP provides an
    opportunity for participants to receive retirement benefits that
    cannot be paid under our tax-qualified plans because of the
    restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended. Benefits are based on compensation and length
    of service and the SERP is unfunded. No contributions by the
    Company are anticipated for the 2006 fiscal year. No benefit
    payments are expected to occur during the next five fiscal years
    and total $1,713,000 during the succeeding five fiscal years. We
    use a December 31 measurement date for the SERP. The
    accrued liability on our balance sheet for the SERP was
    $1,597,000 at December 31, 2006 ($1,032,000 at

Segment
    Reporting

Our business consists primarily of financing and leasing senior
    housing and health care real estate. We evaluate our business
    and make resource allocations on our two business
    segments — investment properties and operating
    properties. Under the investment property segment, we invest in
    senior housing and health care real estate through acquisition
    and financing of primarily single tenant properties. Properties
    acquired are primarily leased under

triple-net

leases and we are not involved in the management of the
    property. Our primary investment property types include skilled
    nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, independent
    living/continuing care retirement communities and specialty care
    facilities. Under the operating property segment, we primarily
    invest in medical office buildings that are typically leased
    under gross leases, modified gross leases or

triple-net

leases, to multiple tenants, and generally require a certain
    level of property management. The accounting policies of the
    segments are the same as those described in the summary of
    significant accounting policies (see Note 1). There are no
    intersegment sales or transfers. We evaluate performance based
    upon net operating income of the combined properties in each
    segment.

Non-segment revenue consists mainly of interest income on
    non-real estate investments and other income. Non-segment assets
    consist of corporate assets including cash, accounts receivable
    and deferred financing costs among others. Non-property specific
    revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual segments
    in determining our performance measure.

    exclude depreciation and amortization, general and
    administrative expenses, impairments, interest expense and
    discontinued operations. We believe

NOI provides investors relevant and
    useful information because it measures the operating performance
    of our medical office buildings at the property level on an

    allocations and to assess the property level performance of our
    medical office buildings.

    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the
    end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
    evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective as of the end of the period covered by this

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
    or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
    in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 based on the criteria established by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    in a report entitled Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework. The scope of management’s assessment as of
    December 31, 2006 did not include an assessment of the
    internal control over financial reporting for Windrose Medical
    Properties Trust in a purchase business combination on
    December 20, 2006. The acquired business represents 23.7%
    of the Company’s consolidated total assets at
    December 31, 2006 and 0.4% of the Company’s net income
    available to common stockholders for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The scope of management’s
    assessment on internal control over financial reporting for
    fiscal year 2007 will include the acquired Windrose Medical
    Properties Trust operations.

Based on this assessment, using the criteria above, management
    concluded that the Company’s system of internal control
    over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
    2006.

The registered independent public accounting firm of
    Ernst & Young LLP, as auditors of the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation
    report on management’s assessment of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) occurred
    during the fourth quarter of the one-year period covered by this
    report that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

Stockholders and Directors

Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting, that Health Care REIT, Inc. maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Health Care REIT Inc.’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Property, management’s
    assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting did not include the internal
    controls of Windrose Medical Properties Trust, which is included
    in the consolidated financial statements of Health Care REIT,
    Inc. and constitute 23.7% of consolidated total assets as of
    December 31, 2006 and 1.0% of consolidated revenues for the
    year then ended. Management did not include an assessment of the
    internal control over financial reporting of Windrose Medical
    Properties Trust because it was acquired in a business
    combination on December 19, 2006.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Health Care
    REIT, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
    opinion, Health Care REIT, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Health Care REIT, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006 of Health Care REIT, Inc. and our report
    dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.
