PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a
self-administered, equity real estate investment trust that
invests in health care facilities, primarily skilled nursing and
assisted living facilities. We also invest in specialty care
facilities. Founded in 1970, we were the first real estate
investment trust to invest exclusively in health care facilities.

As of December 31, 2004, long-term care facilities, which
include skilled nursing and assisted living facilities,
comprised approximately 93% of our investment portfolio. We had
$2,452,878,000 of net real estate investments, inclusive of
credit enhancements, in 394 facilities located in 35 states
and managed by 50 different operators. At that date, the
portfolio included 234 assisted living facilities, 152 skilled
nursing facilities and eight specialty care facilities.

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholders’ capital
and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash
dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase
dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual
increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To
meet these objectives, we invest primarily in long-term care
facilities managed by experienced operators and diversify our
investment portfolio by operator and geographic location.

Depending on the availability and cost of external capital, we
anticipate investing in additional health care facilities
through operating leases with, and loans to, qualified health
care operators. Capital for future investments may be provided
by borrowing under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements,
public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, or the
incurrence or assumption of secured indebtedness.

References herein to “we,” “us,”
“our” or the “Company” refer to Health Care
REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless specifically noted
otherwise.

Assisted Living Facilities

An assisted living facility is a state regulated rental property
that provides both independent living services (e.g., access to
meals, housekeeping, linen service, transportation and social
and recreational activities) and also supportive care from
trained employees to residents who are unable to live
independently and require assistance with activities of daily
living including management of medications, bathing, dressing,
toileting, ambulating and eating. Certain of our assisted living
facilities include other care levels, including independent
living, dementia care and nursing services. Home health care
providers may assist certain residents of our assisted living
facilities that have more intensive medical needs. Assisted
living facilities represent less costly and less
institutional-like alternatives for the care of the elderly or
the frail.

Skilled Nursing Facilities

Skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental
properties where the majority of individuals require 24-hour
nursing and/or medical care. In most cases, these properties are
licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement. These
facilities provide inpatient skilled nursing and personal care
services as well as rehabilitative, restorative and transitional
medical services. In some instances, skilled nursing facilities
supplement hospital care by providing specialized care for
medically complex patients whose conditions require intense
medical and therapeutic services, but who are medically stable
enough to have these services provided in facilities that are
less expensive than acute care hospitals. Certain of our skilled
nursing facilities include other care levels, including assisted
living and dementia care.

Specialty Care Facilities

Our specialty care facilities include acute care hospitals,
long-term acute care hospitals and other specialty care
hospitals. Acute care hospitals provide a wide range of
inpatient and outpatient services including, but not limited to,
surgery, rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories.
Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for
patients with complex medical conditions that require more
intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than that
available in most skilled nursing facilities. Other specialty
care hospitals provide specialized inpatient and outpatient
services for specific illnesses or diseases including, among
others, orthopedic, neurosurgical and behavioral care.

Investments

We invest in health care facilities with a primary focus on
long-term care facilities, which include skilled nursing and
assisted living facilities. We also invest in specialty care
facilities. We diversify our investment portfolio by operator
and geographic location.

In determining whether to invest in a facility, we focus on the
following: (a) the experience of the tenant’s or
borrower’s management team; (b) the historical and
projected financial and operational performance of the facility;
(c) the credit of the tenant or borrower; (d) the
security for the lease or loan; and (e) the capital
committed to the facility by the tenant or borrower. We conduct
market research and analysis for all potential investments. In
addition, we review the value of all facilities, the interest
rates and debt service coverage requirements of any debt to be
assumed and the anticipated sources of repayment of any debt.

Our investments are primarily real property leased to operators
under long-term operating leases and mortgage loans.
Construction financing is provided, but only as part of a
long-term operating lease or mortgage loan. Substantially all of
our investments are designed with escalating rate structures.
Depending upon market conditions, we believe that appropriate
new investments will be available in the future with
substantially the same spreads over our cost of capital.
Operating leases and mortgage loans are normally credit enhanced
by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating
leases are typically structured as master leases and mortgage
loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized
with other mortgage loans, operating leases or agreements
between us and the operator and its affiliates.

At December 31, 2004, 85% of our owned real property was
subject to master leases. A master lease is a lease of multiple
facilities from us to one tenant entity under a single lease
agreement. From time to time, we



may acquire additional facilities that are then leased to the
tenant under the master lease. The tenant is required to make
one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties
that are subject to the master lease. Typically, the master
lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the facilities
or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased
facilities at the same time. This “bundling” feature
benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or
renewal to the better performing facilities and terminate the
leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing
facilities. This spreads our risk among the entire group of
facilities within the master lease. The bundling feature may
provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in
bankruptcy. Subject to certain restrictions, a debtor in
bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases.
It is our intent that a tenant who is in bankruptcy would be
required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole, rather
than making the decision on a facility by facility basis.

We monitor our investments through a variety of methods
determined by the type of health care facility and operator. Our
monitoring process includes review of monthly financial
statements and other operating data for each facility, quarterly
review of operator creditworthiness, periodic facility
inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to
licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other
collateral. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a
proprietary database to collect and analyze facility-specific
data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain
industry trends and risks.

Through monitoring and research, we evaluate the operating
environment in each facility’s market to determine whether
payment risk is likely to increase. When we identify
unacceptable levels of payment risk, we seek to mitigate,
eliminate or transfer the risk. We categorize the risk as
operator, facility or market risk. For operator risk, we
typically find a substitute operator to run the facility. For
facility risk, we usually work with the operator to institute
facility level management changes to address the risk. Finally,
for market risk, we often encourage an operator to change its
capital structure, including refinancing or raising additional
equity. Through these monitoring and research efforts, we are
generally able to intervene at an early stage and address
payment risk, and in so doing, support both the collectibility
of revenue and the value of our investment.

Operating Leases

Each facility, which includes the land, building, improvements
and related rights, owned by us is leased to an operator
pursuant to a long-term operating lease. As discussed above,
most of our leased properties are subject to master leases. The
leases generally have a fixed term of seven to 15 years and
contain one or more five to 15-year renewal options. Each lease
is a net lease requiring the tenant to pay rent and all
additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased
property. The tenants are required to repair, rebuild and
maintain the leased properties.

The net value of our completed leased properties aggregated
approximately $2,164,964,000 at December 31, 2004. Prior to
June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual
rental escalators, which were generally recognized on a
straight-line basis over the initial lease period. Beginning in
June 2004, our new standard lease structure contains annual
rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the
Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating
revenues of the property. These escalators are not fixed, so no
straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is
recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for
the period. This lease structure will initially generate lower
revenues, net income and funds from operations compared to
leases with fixed escalators that require straight-lining, but
will enable us to generate additional organic growth and
minimize non-cash straight-line rent over time. This change does
not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends.

We currently provide for the construction of facilities for
tenants as part of long-term operating leases. We capitalize
certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the
construction of properties owned by us. The amount capitalized
is based upon the balance outstanding during the construction
period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of
financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount
capitalized. We also typically charge a transaction fee at the
commencement of construction. The construction period commences
upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion
of the applicable facility or the end of a specified period,
generally 12 to 18 months. During the construction period,
we advance funds to the operator in accordance with agreed upon
terms and conditions which require, among other things, a site



visit by a Company representative prior to the advancement of
funds. During the construction period, we generally require an
additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and
performance bonds and/or completion guaranties. At
December 31, 2004, we had outstanding construction
investments of $26,183,000 ($25,463,000 for leased properties
and $720,000 for construction loans) and were committed to
providing additional funds of approximately $3,833,000 to
complete construction.

Mortgage Loans

Our investments in mortgage loans are typically structured to
provide us with interest income, principal amortization and
transaction fees and are generally secured by a first or second
mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage.

At December 31, 2004, the interest rates (excluding any
loans on non-accrual) averaged approximately 9.7% per annum
on our outstanding mortgage loan balances. Our yield on mortgage
loans depends upon a number of factors, including the stated
interest rate, average principal amount outstanding during the
term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.

The mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2004 are
generally subject to three to 20-year terms with principal
amortization schedules and/or balloon payment of the outstanding
principal balance at the end of the term. Generally, the
mortgage loans provide three to eight years of prepayment
protection.

Working Capital Loans

Working capital loans are loans made to operators of facilities
and are typically either secured and/or guaranteed. These
instruments have terms ranging from three months to ten years.
At December 31, 2004, the average interest rates (excluding
any loans on non-accrual) were approximately 10.6% per
annum on our outstanding working capital loan balances. At
December 31, 2004, we had provided working capital loans to
16 operators.

Subdebt Investments

Subdebt investments are loans made to operators of facilities
and are generally secured by the operator’s leasehold
rights and corporate guaranties. Generally, these instruments
are for four to seven-year terms. At December 31, 2004, the
average interest rates (excluding any loans on non-accrual) were
approximately 10.6% per annum on our outstanding subdebt
investment balances. At December 31, 2004, we had provided
subdebt financing to four operators.

Equity Investments

We had an investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P., a
property group that specializes in the financing, through sale
and leaseback transactions, of nursing and care homes located in
the United Kingdom. This investment was accounted for under the
equity method of accounting because we had the ability to
exercise significant influence, but not control, over the
company due to our 31% ownership interest. In October 2003, we
sold our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P.,
generating a net gain of $902,000.

Other equity investments, which consist of investments in
private and public companies for which we do not have the
ability to exercise influence, are accounted for under the cost
method. Under the cost method of accounting, investments in
private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for
other-than-temporary declines in fair value, distributions of
earnings and additional investments. For investments in public
companies that have readily determinable fair market values, we
classify our equity investments as available-for-sale and,
accordingly, record these investments at their fair market
values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
other comprehensive income, a separate component of
stockholders’ equity. These investments represent a minimal
ownership interest in these companies.



Borrowing Policies

We utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund the purchase
of new properties and to provide mortgage loans. Our debt to
equity levels are determined by management to maintain a
conservative credit profile. Generally, we intend to issue
unsecured, fixed rate public debt with longer-term maturities to
approximate the maturities on our leases and loans. For
short-term purposes, we may borrow on our unsecured lines of
credit arrangements. We replace these borrowings with
longer-term capital such as unsecured senior notes, common stock
or preferred stock. When terms are deemed favorable, we may
invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness.
In addition, we may obtain financing for unleveraged properties
in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired
on a leveraged basis. It is our intent to limit secured
indebtedness. In our agreements with our lenders, we are subject
to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured
indebtedness.

Operator Concentrations

The following table summarizes certain information about our
operator concentrations as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in
thousands):



Competition

We compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate
partnerships, banks, insurance companies, finance companies,
government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds
and other investors in the acquisition, leasing and financing of
health care facilities. We compete for investments based on a
number of factors including rates, financings offered,
underwriting criterion and reputation. The operators of our
facilities compete on a local and regional basis with operators
of facilities that provide comparable services. Operators
compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors
including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of
facilities, services offered, family preferences, physicians,
staff and price.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we employed 39 full-time
employees.

Certain Government Regulations

Health Law Matters — Generally

We invest in assisted living, skilled nursing and specialty care
facilities, which represented approximately 54%, 39% and 7%,
respectively, of our investments at December 31, 2004.

Typically, operators of assisted living facilities do not
receive significant funding from governmental programs and are
regulated by the states, not the federal government. Operators
of skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are subject to
federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the
medical and/or nursing care provided, ancillary services (e.g.,
respiratory, occupational, physical and infusion therapies),
qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing
staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment,
distribution of pharmaceuticals, reimbursement and rate setting
and operating policies. In addition, as described below, some of
our facility operators are subject to extensive laws and
regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including
kickbacks, physician self-referrals and false claims.

Licensing and Certification

The primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities
are the states’ licensing laws. In granting and renewing
these licenses, the regulatory authorities consider numerous
factors relating to a facility’s physical plant and
operations including, but not limited to, admission and
discharge standards and staffing and training. A decision to
grant or renew a license is also affected by a facility’s
record with respect to consumer rights and medication guidelines
and rules.

Generally, our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are
required to be licensed on an annual or bi-annual basis and to
be certified for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. These facilities are subject to audits and surveys by
various regulatory agencies that determine compliance with
federal, state and local laws. The failure of our facility
operators to maintain or renew any required license or
regulatory approval or the failure to clear serious survey
deficiencies could prevent them from continuing operations at a
property. In addition, if a facility is found out of compliance
with the conditions of participation in Medicare, Medicaid or
other health care programs, or if a facility is otherwise
excluded from those programs, the facility may be barred from
participation in government reimbursement programs. Any of these
occurrences may impair the ability of our operators to meet
their obligations to us. If we have to replace a facility
operator, our ability to replace the operator may be affected by
federal and state rules and policies governing changes in
control. Under current Medicare and Medicaid rules and
regulations and provider contracts, a successor operator that
assumes an existing provider agreement will typically be subject
to certain liabilities of the previous operator, including
overpayments, terms under any existing plan of correction and
possibly sanctions and penalties. If a successor operator
chooses to apply for a new Medicare and/or Medicaid provider
agreement, the successor operator may experience interruptions
and delays in reimbursement during the processing of its
application for a new provider agreement or its application may
not be approved. This may result in payment delays, an inability
to find a replacement operator, a significant working capital
commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties.



Reimbursement

Assisted Living Facilities.

Approximately 55% of our
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, were
attributable to assisted living facilities. The majority of the
revenues received by the operators of our assisted living
facilities are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue
source is primarily Medicaid waiver programs. As a part of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) of 1981,
Congress established a waiver program under Medicaid to offer an
alternative to institutional long-term care services. The
provisions of OBRA and the subsequent OBRA Acts of 1987 and 1990
allow states flexibility in developing cost-effective
alternatives to long-term care, including assisted living and
home health. At December 31, 2004, ten of our 31 assisted
living operators utilized Medicaid waivers. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, approximately 11% of the revenues at our
assisted living facilities were from Medicaid reimbursement.

Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and
are largely determined by local market conditions and operating
costs. Generally, facilities receive a higher payment per day
for a private pay resident than for a Medicaid beneficiary who
requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid
reimbursement varies from state to state. Thus, the revenues
generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be
adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level and changes in
Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels. Changes in
revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an
operator’s ability to meet its obligation to us.

Skilled Nursing Facilities and Specialty Care Facilities.

Skilled nursing and specialty care facilities typically receive
most of their revenues from Medicare and Medicaid, with the
balance representing private pay, including private insurance.
Consequently, skilled nursing and specialty care facilities rely
heavily on government reimbursement. Changes in federal or state
reimbursement policies, including changes in payment rates as a
result of federal or state regulatory action, or payment delays
by fiscal intermediaries may also adversely affect an
operator’s ability to cover its expenses, including our
rent or debt service. Skilled nursing and specialty care
facilities are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews
and other audits by federal and state authorities. A review or
audit of claims of a facility operator could result in
recoupments, denials or delays of payments in the future, which
could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s
ability to meet its obligations to us. Due to the significant
judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting,
no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves
maintained by our facility operators for potential adjustments
to reimbursements for payor settlements. Due to budgetary
constraints, governmental payors may limit or reduce payments to
skilled nursing and specialty care facilities. As a result of
government reimbursement programs being subject to such
budgetary pressures and legislative and administrative actions,
an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us may be
significantly impaired.

Medicare Reimbursement and Skilled Nursing Facilities.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately 28% of
the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities (which comprised
39% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004)
were from Medicare reimbursement. In an effort to reduce federal
spending on health care, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997
(“BBA”) contained extensive changes to the Medicare
and Medicaid programs intended to reduce the projected payments
under these programs. The BBA fundamentally altered Medicare
payment methodologies for skilled nursing facilities by
mandating the institution of the skilled nursing facility
prospective payment system. This system differs significantly
from the prior cost-based reimbursement system. Among other
things, it sets per diem rates based on 1995 cost reports as
adjusted by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to,
costs associated with 44 resource utilization group categories
(“RUGs”). The payments received under the skilled
nursing facility prospective payment system cover services for
Medicare patients, including all ancillary services, such as
respiratory, physical, and occupational therapy and certain
covered medications. The skilled nursing facility prospective
payment system caused Medicare per diem reimbursement for
skilled nursing facility services to decrease. The reductions in
Medicare payments resulted in immediate financial difficulties
for skilled nursing facilities and caused a number of operators
to seek bankruptcy protection.

Since the BBA’s passage in 1997, the federal government has
passed legislation to lessen the negative financial impact from
the prospective payment system. For example, under the Balanced
Budget Refinement



Act of 1999 (“BBRA”) and the Benefits Improvement and
Patient Protection Act of 2000 (“BIPA”), some of the
mandatory reductions in Medicare payment increases were reversed
or delayed, and skilled nursing facilities received temporary
payment increases. BBRA included two key provisions: [i] a 20%
increase for 15 of the RUGs and [ii] a 4% across-the-board
increase to the federal per diem rate. The 20% increase was
implemented in April 2000 and will remain in effect until the
implementation of refinements in the current RUG case-mix
classification system. The 4% increase was implemented in April
2000 and expired on September 30, 2002. BIPA also included
two key provisions: [i] a 16.66% increase in the nursing
component of the federal per diem rate and [ii] a 6.7% increase
in the 14 RUG payments for rehabilitation therapy services. The
16.66% increase was implemented in April of 2001 and expired on
September 30, 2002. The 6.7% increase is an adjustment to
the 20% increase granted in BBRA and spreads the funds directed
at three of those 15 RUGs to an additional 11 rehabilitation
RUGs. This increase was implemented in April 2001 and will
remain in effect until the implementation of refinements in the
current RUG case-mix classification system. The 4% and 16.66%
increases that expired on September 30, 2002 decreased
annual reimbursement by roughly $1.8 billion. Although the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) did
not implement RUG refinements for fiscal year 2005, annual
reimbursement could be reduced by roughly $1.5 billion if a
new case-mix system is implemented in the future. There is no
assurance that the new case-mix classification will account for
this reduction so that nursing facilities are not adversely
affected.

Skilled nursing facilities received a 2.8% inflation basket
increase in Medicare payments for federal fiscal year 2005. The
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act
of 2003 imposed a moratorium on the therapy caps for Part B
outpatient rehabilitation services through December 31,
2005. The therapy caps were mandated by the BBA. If ever
imposed, the annual payment cap of $1,590 per patient would
apply to both occupational therapy and physical and speech
therapy. Patients exceeding the cap would need to use private
funds to pay for the cost of additional therapy.

Medicare Reimbursement and Specialty Care Facilities.

For
the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately 45% of the
revenues at our specialty care facilities (which comprised 6% of
our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004) were
from Medicare. Specialty care facilities generally are
reimbursed by Medicare under either the diagnosis related
group/outpatient prospective payment system reimbursement
methodology for regular hospitals, or the new prospective
payment system for inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Acute
care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient
services including, but not limited to, surgery, rehabilitation,
therapy and clinical laboratories. Long-term acute care
hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex
medical conditions that require more intensive care, monitoring
or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing
facilities. Some of our other specialty care facilities provide
specialized inpatient and outpatient services for specific
illnesses or diseases including, among others, orthopedic,
neurosurgical and behavioral care services.

With respect to Medicare’s diagnosis related
group/outpatient prospective payment system methodology for
regular hospitals, reimbursement for inpatient services is on
the basis of a fixed, prospective rate based on the principal
diagnosis of the patient. Diagnoses are grouped into more than
500 diagnosis related groups. In some cases, a hospital might be
able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s
charges exceed a threshold. CMS has revised its outlier
methodology in response to allegations that some hospitals
increased their outlier reimbursement by substantially
increasing charges. Under the revisions, outlier reimbursement
for all hospitals is expected to decline. In addition, the
government is evaluating the past practices of hospitals
relating to outlier payments. If any of the operators of our
specialty care facilities were found to have substantially
increased charges in an attempt to increase outlier payments,
there is a risk that such operators could be investigated and
required to refund a portion of outlier payments received plus
possible penalties.

Congress has limited increases in diagnosis related groups or
outpatient prospective payment system payments. These limited
increases may not be sufficient to cover specialty care
facilities’ increasing costs of providing care. Failure to
increase reimbursement to cover increased costs, or reductions
or freezes in payment rates, will have an adverse impact on
operators of our specialty care facilities.

The BBA, as amended by BBRA and BIPA, also authorized the
development of a prospective payment system for inpatient
rehabilitation facilities, including freestanding rehabilitation
hospitals and rehabilitation



units of acute care hospitals. The inpatient rehabilitation
facility prospective payment system methodology replaces the
reasonable cost-based payment system.

Under the final regulations that implemented the inpatient
rehabilitation facility prospective payment systems,
rehabilitation hospitals are required to complete a patient
assessment instrument upon admission and discharge for all
Medicare Part A fee-for-service patients who are already
inpatients or who are admitted or discharged on or after
January 1, 2002. Based on the data received from the
inpatient rehabilitation facility patient assessment instrument,
each patient is placed into a case-mix group. Each case-mix
group is a functional-related group determined by distinguishing
classes of inpatient rehabilitation facility patient discharges
on the basis of impairment, age, co-morbidities, functional
capability of the patient and other factors the Medicare program
deems appropriate to improve the explanatory power of functional
independence measure function related groups. The case mix group
determines the base payment rate for the Medicare-covered
Part A services furnished by the inpatient rehabilitation
facility during the beneficiary’s episode of care.
Inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system
rates encompass the inpatient capital costs and operating costs,
including routine and ancillary costs, of furnishing covered
rehabilitation services. Other indirect operating costs
(including, among other things, bad debts, approved educational
activities and non-physician anesthetist’s services) are
not included. Payment rates are calculated using relative
weights to account for variations in resource needs in case mix
groups.

Pursuant to the BBA, as amended by BBRA and BIPA, payments
during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 were budget neutral with
payments for fiscal year 2001 equaling 98% of the amount of
payments that would have been paid if the inpatient
rehabilitation facility prospective payment system had not been
enacted and 100% for fiscal year 2002. For cost reporting
periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, payment is
based solely on the adjusted federal prospective payment.

The ability of our operators to adjust to the shift from
reasonable cost reimbursement to an inpatient rehabilitation
facility prospective payment system will impact the cash flow of
these facilities. Failure to control costs or manage the care
provided under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective
payment system would have an adverse impact on an
operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us.

Medicaid Reimbursement.

Medicaid is a major payor source
for residents in our skilled nursing and specialty care
facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
approximately 56% of the revenues of our skilled nursing
facilities and 29% of the revenues of our specialty care
facilities were attributable to Medicaid payments. The federal
government and the states share responsibility for financing
Medicaid. The federal matching rate, known as the Federal
Medical Assistance Percentage, varies by state based on relative
per capita income. Medicaid is typically the second largest item
in state budgets, representing approximately 17% on average,
after elementary and secondary education. The percentage of
Medicaid dollars used for long-term care varies from state to
state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and
eligibility requirements. With certain federal guidelines,
states have a wide range of discretion to determine eligibility
and reimbursement methodology. Many states reimburse long-term
care facilities using fixed daily rates, which are applied
prospectively based on the historical costs incurred in
providing patient care. Reasonable costs typically include
allowances for staffing, administrative and general, and
property and equipment (e.g., depreciation and fair rental).

In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of
providing skilled nursing services. The shortfall is due in part
to the BBA, which repealed the Boren Amendment. The Boren
Amendment required states to fund Medicaid expenditures in an
amount that was sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of an
efficient provider. Consequently, Medicaid funding is vulnerable
to state balanced budget requirements. Due to declining tax
revenues, some states are attempting to slow the rate of growth
in Medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting
eligibility and benefits. States in which we have skilled
nursing facility investments increased their per diem Medicaid
rates roughly 3% on average for fiscal year 2005. Two of our
states reduced Medicaid rates in fiscal year 2005. Per diem
rates at most of our facilities in these two states decreased 0
to 4% versus the previous year. Despite any budgeted rate
increases, long-term care rates may decline if revenues in a
particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted
expenditures.



The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care
facilities continue to evolve. Federal and state authorities
have considered and may seek to implement new or modified
reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health
care facility operations. The impact of any such change, if
implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our
skilled nursing and specialty care facility operations. No
assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels
will be maintained. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
payments under a government reimbursement program are currently
or will, in the future, be sufficient to fully reimburse the
facility operators for their operating and capital expenses. As
a result, an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to
us could be adversely impacted.

Other Related Laws

Skilled nursing and specialty care facilities (and assisted
living facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to
federal, state and local laws and regulations (including those
laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse), which govern
the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be
entered into by health care providers. Certain of these laws
prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose
of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical
products or services reimbursable by governmental programs.
Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary
services and submit to the government valid and accurate
statements for each service. Still other laws require providers
to comply with a variety of safety, health and other
requirements relating to the condition of the licensed facility
and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violation of
these laws and regulations may include, but are not limited to,
criminal and/or civil penalties and fines and a loss of
licensure and immediate termination of governmental payments. In
certain circumstances, violation of these rules (such as those
prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one
facility may subject other facilities under common control or
ownership to sanctions, including disqualification from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In the
ordinary course of its business, a facility operator is
regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations and audits by
federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and
regulations.

Each skilled nursing and specialty care facility (and any
assisted living facility that receives Medicaid payments) is
subject to the federal anti-kickback statute that generally
prohibits persons from offering, providing, soliciting or
receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an
individual or the furnishing of a good or service, for which
payment may be made under a federal health care program such as
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Skilled nursing and
specialty care facilities are also subject to the federal Ethics
in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the
Stark Law. The Stark Law generally prohibits the submission of
claims to Medicare for payment if the claim results from a
physician referral for certain designated services and the
physician has a financial relationship with the health service
provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a
financial relationship under the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions
on physician self-referrals and submission of claims apply to
state Medicaid programs. Further, skilled nursing and specialty
care facilities (and assisted living facilities that receive
Medicaid payments) are subject to substantial financial
penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the False
Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the False Claims
Act’s “whistleblower” provisions. Private
enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part
to amendments to the False Claims Act that encourage private
individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These
whistleblower suits by private individuals, known as qui tam
actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and
former patients, nurses and other employees. Prosecutions,
investigations or qui tam actions could have a material adverse
effect on a facility operator’s liquidity, financial
condition and results of operations which could adversely affect
the ability of the operator to meet its obligations to us.
Finally, various state false claim and anti-kickback laws also
may apply to each facility operator. Violation of any of the
foregoing statutes can result in criminal and/or civil penalties
that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an
operator to meet its obligations to us.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
which became effective January 1, 1997, greatly expanded
the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and
broadened its scope to include private health care plans in
addition to government payors. It also greatly increased funding
for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation
and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of
Health and Human Services to audit, investigate and prosecute
suspected health care fraud.



Additionally, the administrative simplification provisions of
this law provide for communication of health information through
standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and
security of health information. In order to comply with the
regulations, health care providers must undergo significant
operational and technical changes, and these modifications may
represent significant costs for our health care providers. These
additional costs may, in turn, adversely affect the ability of
our operators to meet their obligations to us.

Finally, government investigation and enforcement of health care
laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and
is expected to continue. Some of these enforcement actions
represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application
of false claims laws. The costs for an operator of a health care
facility associated with both defending such enforcement actions
and the undertakings in settlement agreements can be substantial
and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an
operator to meet its obligations to us.

Taxation

Federal Income Tax Considerations

The following summary of the taxation of the Company and the
material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and
equity securities is for general information only and is not tax
advice. This summary does not address all aspects of taxation
that may be relevant to certain types of holders of stock or
securities (including, but not limited to, insurance companies,
tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging,
integrated conversion or constructive sale transaction or a
straddle, traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method
of accounting for their securities, investors in pass-through
entities and foreign corporations and persons who are not
citizens or residents of the United States).

This summary does not discuss all of the aspects of
U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in
light of your particular investment or other circumstances. In
addition, this summary does not discuss any state or local
income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax
consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal
income tax law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal
income tax law, including changes in law or differing
interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have
a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our
securities as set forth in this summary. Before you purchase our
securities, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding
the particular U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and
other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling of our
securities.

General

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (or
REIT) commencing with our first taxable year. We intend to
continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT,
but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain
qualified as a REIT for subsequent years. Qualification and
taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety of
qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with
respect to income, assets, distribution level and diversity of
share ownership as discussed below under
“— Qualification as a REIT.” There can be no
assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate
in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified.

In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general, we will
not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT
taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to
stockholders. We may, however, be subject to tax at normal
corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not
distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net
long-term capital gain, stockholders are required to include
their proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital
gain in income, but they will receive a refundable credit for
their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain.



Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to federal income
and excise tax as follows:

If we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been
a “C” corporation in a carryover basis transaction, we
could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited
from the “C” corporation. A “C” corporation
is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay
full corporate level federal income tax. If we recognize gain on
the disposition of the assets during the ten-year period
beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us,
then to the extent of the assets’ “built-in gain”
(i.e., the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the
adjusted tax basis in the asset, in each case determined as of
the beginning of the ten-year period), we will be subject to tax
on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable.
The results described in this paragraph with respect to the
recognition of built-in gain assume that the built-in gain
assets, at the time the built-in gain assets were subject to a
conversion transaction (either where a “C” corporation
elected REIT status or a REIT acquired the assets from a
“C” corporation), were not treated as sold to an
unrelated party and gain recognized.



Qualification as a REIT

A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or association:

Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the
entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at
least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or
during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than
12 months. For purposes of conditions (5) and (6),
pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated
as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception
in the case of condition (6).

Based on publicly available information, we believe we have
satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in
(5) and (6) above. In addition, Article VI of our
Amended and Restated By-Laws provides for restrictions regarding
ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are
intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share
ownership requirements described in (5) and (6) above.
These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all
cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements
described in (5) and (6) above.

We have complied with, and will continue to comply with,
regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our
stockholders requesting information regarding the actual
ownership of our stock. If despite sending the annual letters,
we do not know, or after exercising reasonable diligence would
not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer
Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer
Requirement. If we fail to comply with these regulatory rules,
we will be subject to a monetary penalty. If our failure to
comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement, the
penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply
were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty
would be imposed.

We may own a number of properties through wholly owned
subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified
REIT subsidiary” if 100% of its stock is owned by a REIT
and the REIT does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable
REIT subsidiary. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” will
not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets,
liabilities and items of income, deductions and credits of a
“qualified REIT subsidiary” will be treated as assets,
liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT. A
“qualified REIT subsidiary” is not subject to federal
income tax, and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified
REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against
ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more
than 10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or
more than 5% of the value of our total assets, as described
below under “— Asset Tests.”

If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability company or a
trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will
be deemed to own a proportionate share of the
partnership’s, limited liability company’s or
trust’s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving
our share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited
liability company or trust, and the gross income will retain the
same character in our



hands as it has in the hands of the partnership, limited
liability company or trust. These “look-through” rules
apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests
described below.

Income Tests.

There are two separate percentage tests
relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for
each taxable year.

•

At least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
    directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from
    “rents from real property,” other income from
    investments relating to real property or mortgages on real
    property or certain income from qualified temporary investments.

•

At least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from
    certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
    directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the
    sources qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from
    dividends (including dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries)
    and interest.

For taxable years beginning on or before October 22, 2004,
(i) payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap
agreement, option, futures contract, forward rate agreement or
any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce
interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred
and (ii) gain from the sale or other disposition of any
such investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95%
gross income test. For taxable years beginning after
October 22, 2004, any of our income from a “clearly
identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us
in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to
manage the risk of interest rate movements, price changes or
currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations
incurred or to be incurred by us, or such other risks that are
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is excluded from the
95% gross income test. In general, a hedging transaction is
“clearly identified” if (i) the transaction is
identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on
which it is entered into and (ii) the items or risks being
hedged are identified “substantially
contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction. An
identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is
made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging
transaction.

Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real
property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests
for a REIT only if several conditions are met:

For taxable years beginning after August 5, 1997, a REIT
has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of
impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts
received with respect to that property as rent from real
property. The amount received or accrued by the REIT during the
taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a
property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by
the REIT directly or indirectly from the property. The amount
received for any service or management operation



for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150% of the
direct cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service
or providing the management or operation. Furthermore,
impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable
REIT subsidiary subject to certain conditions, and we may still
treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from
real property.

The term “interest” generally does not include any
amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in
part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount
generally will not be excluded from the term
“interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed
percentage of receipts or sales.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income
tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a
REIT for such year if we are eligible for relief. For taxable
years beginning on or before October 22, 2004, these relief
provisions generally will be available if (a) our failure
to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to
willful neglect; (b) we attach a schedule of the sources of
our income to our return; and (c) any incorrect information
on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax.
For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, these
relief provisions generally will be available if
(a) following our identification of the failure, we file a
schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross
income and (b) the failure to meet such tests was due to
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.

It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under
which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is
imposed on an amount equal to (a) the gross income
attributable to (i) 75% of our gross income over the amount
of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% income test
and (ii) 95% of our gross income (90% of our gross income
for taxable years beginning on or before October 22, 2004)
over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the
95% income test, multiplied by (b) a fraction intended to
reflect our profitability.

Asset Tests.

Within 30 days after the close of each
quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy several tests
relating to the nature and diversification of our assets
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. At least 75% of the value of our total assets must
be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items
(including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our
operation), government securities and qualified temporary
investments. Although the remaining 25% of our assets generally
may be invested without restriction, we are prohibited from
owning securities representing more than 10% of either the vote
(the “10% vote test”) or value (the “10% value
test”) of the outstanding securities of any issuer other
than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT
subsidiary. Further, no more than 20% of the total assets may be
represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT
subsidiaries (the “20% asset test”) and no more than
5% of the value of our total assets may be represented by
securities of any non-governmental issuer other than a qualified
REIT subsidiary (the “5% asset test”), another REIT or
a taxable REIT subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10%
value test and the 20% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at
the end of each quarter. There are special rules which provide
relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to
changes in the value of the assets of a REIT.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000,
certain items are excluded from the 10% value test, including
(i) straight debt securities of an issuer (including
straight debt that provides certain contingent payments);
(ii) any loan to an individual or an estate; (iii) any
rental agreement described in Section 467 of the Internal
Revenue Code, other than with a “related person”;
(iv) any obligation to pay rents from real property;
(v) certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision
thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, or any
political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico; (vi) any security issued by a REIT; and
(vii) any other arrangement that, as determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury, is excepted from the definition of
security (“excluded securities”). Special rules apply
to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities
taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If a
REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds (i) straight
debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and
(ii) securities of such issuer that are not excluded
securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1% of such
issuer’s outstanding securities, the straight debt
securities will be included in the 10% value test.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, a
REIT’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not
treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value
test to securities issued by the partnership.



Further, any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be
a security for purposes of applying the 10% value test
(i) to the extent of the REIT’s interest as a partner
in the partnership and (ii) if at least 75% of the
partnership’s gross income (excluding gross income from
prohibited transactions) would qualify for the 75% gross income
test. For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004,
for purposes of the 10% value test, a REIT’s interest in a
partnership’s assets is the REIT’s proportionate
interest in any securities issued by the partnership (other than
the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph).

For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004,
following the 30 day cure period after the close of a
taxable quarter, for violations of the 10% vote test, the 10%
value test or the 5% asset test, a REIT may avoid
disqualification as a REIT by disposing of sufficient assets to
cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the
REIT’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or
$10,000,000, provided that the disposition occurs within six
months following the last day of the quarter in which the REIT
first identified the assets. For violations of any of the REIT
asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that
exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence, a
REIT can avoid disqualification as a REIT following the
30 day cure period after the close of a taxable quarter by
taking certain steps, including disposition of sufficient assets
within the six month period described above to meet the
applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to the greater of
$50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net
income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period
of time that the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and
filing a schedule with the Internal Revenue Service that
describes the non-qualifying assets.

Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.

For taxable
years beginning after December 31, 2000, REITs may own more
than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in taxable
REIT subsidiaries. We and any taxable corporate entity in which
we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such
entity as a “taxable REIT subsidiary.”

Several of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a
taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject
to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but
are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that
cannot be performed directly by REITs without jeopardizing their
REIT status. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries will attempt to
minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can be no
assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to
minimize taxes will be successful. To the extent our taxable
REIT subsidiaries are required to pay federal, state or local
taxes, the cash available for distribution as dividends to us
from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced.

The amount of interest on related-party debt that a taxable REIT
subsidiary may deduct is limited. Further, a 100% tax applies to
any interest payments by a taxable REIT subsidiary to its
affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate is not
commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT subsidiary is permitted
to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of
these restrictions.

The Internal Revenue Service may reallocate costs between a REIT
and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is a lack of
arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any deductible
expenses allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would
increase its tax liability. Further, any amount by which a REIT
understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable
REIT subsidiary will, subject to certain exceptions, be subject
to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may
be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an
interest.

Annual Distribution Requirements.

In order to avoid being
taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to make
distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to our
stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in
an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of
our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to
the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and
(ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from
foreclosure property, minus (B) a portion of certain items
of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid in the
taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable
year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that
year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution
payment after such declaration. The amount distributed must not
be preferential. This means that every stockholder of the class
of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the
same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of
stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its
dividend rights as a class. To the extent that we do not
distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least
90%, but



less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as
adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount
at regular corporate tax rates. Finally, as discussed above, we
may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other
distribution requirements. We intend to make timely
distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution
requirements.

It is possible that, from time to time, we may not have
sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%
distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount
as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to,
among other things, (a) timing differences between
(i) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of
deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and
deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or
(b) the payment of severance benefits that may not be
deductible to us. In the event that timing differences occur, we
may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or, if possible,
pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to
meet the distribution requirement.

Under certain circumstances, in the event of a deficiency
determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be able to
rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement
for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to
stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our
deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year. Thus, we
may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as
deficiency distributions; however, we will be required to pay
applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any
deduction taken for deficiency distributions.

Failure to Qualify as a REIT

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable
year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any
applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at
regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any
year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be
deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be
required to be made in any year. All distributions to
stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of
current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these
distributions and, subject to certain limitations, will be
eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate
stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory
provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT
for the four taxable years following the year during which
qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in
all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief.
Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to
incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay
potentially significant resulting tax liabilities.

In addition to the relief described above under
“— Income Tests” and “— Asset
Tests,” relief is available in the event that we violate a
provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would result in our
failure to qualify as a REIT if (i) the violation is due to
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, (ii) we
pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to satisfy the
provision, and (iii) the violation does not include a
violation described under “— Income Tests”
or “— Asset Tests” above. It is not now
possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be
entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions.

Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock

Treatment of Taxable U.S. Stockholders.

The
following summary applies to you only if you are a
“U.S. stockholder.” A
“U.S. stockholder” is a stockholder of shares of
stock who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is:

•

a citizen or resident of the United States;

•

a corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a
    corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
    organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any
    political subdivision of the United States, including any state;

•

an estate, the income of which is subject to United States
    federal income taxation regardless of its source; or



•

a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise
    primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one
    or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal
    Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the
    trust’s substantial decisions.

So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, distributions on
shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated
earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not
designated as capital gain dividends) will be includable as
ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. None of these
distributions will be eligible for the dividends received
deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.

Generally, for taxable years ending after May 6, 2003
through December 31, 2008, the maximum marginal rate of tax
payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations
that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15%. Except in
limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to dividends
paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not
subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable
income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The
reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that
portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect to
our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received
by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT
subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect
to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax
during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute
100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or
(3) the amount of any earnings and profits that were
distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year.

Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will
be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year),
without regard to the period for which you held our stock.
However, if you are a corporation, you may be required to treat
a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income.

If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net long-term
capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital
gain, your proportionate share of this net long-term capital
gain. You would also receive a refundable tax credit for your
proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained
capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of
your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable
capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid.

You may not include in your federal income tax return any of our
net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules
may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and
preferences be apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution
declared by us in October, November or December of any year on a
specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid
by us and received by you on December 31 of that year,
provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later
than January 31 of the following year.

We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to
treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required
to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise
tax discussed under “— General” and
“— Qualification as a REIT — Annual
Distribution Requirements” above. As a result, you may be
required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions
that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital.
Moreover, any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as
a dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as
the case may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any
other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings
and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these
distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your
shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax
basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these
distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero, after
which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if
the shares of our stock are held as a capital asset. The tax
basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain
or loss, if any, realized upon sale of the shares of our stock.
Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which
were held for six months or less (after application of certain
holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term
capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain
distributions with respect to these shares of our stock.

Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with
a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of
our stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us,
you will generally



recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between
the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted
tax basis in these shares of our stock. This gain will be
capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital
asset.

If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment can only be
determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of
redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as
opposed to dividend income) equal to the difference between the
amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax
basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption results in a
“complete termination” of your interest in all classes
of our equity securities, is a “substantially
disproportionate redemption” or is “not essentially
equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you. In applying
these tests, there must be taken into account your ownership of
all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common stock,
preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must
take into account any equity securities that are considered to
be constructively owned by you.

If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you no
longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity
securities or only own (actually and constructively) an
insubstantial percentage of our equity securities, then it is
probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered
“not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and, thus,
would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a
distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a
dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances,
and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption,
you should consult your tax advisor to determine their
application to the particular situation.

Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests described
above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of
your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a
dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or
accumulated earnings and profits. If the redemption is taxed as
a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will
be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If
you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain
circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related
person, or it may be lost entirely.

Gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than
one year is taxed at a maximum long-term capital gain rate,
which is currently 15%. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service
guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends
as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as
gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt U.S. Stockholders.

Tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and
profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts
(“Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt from
federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation
on their unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”).
The Internal Revenue Service has issued a published revenue
ruling that dividend distributions from a REIT to an exempt
employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the
shares of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade
or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on this
ruling, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations
generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt
Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock
with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI
pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules.
Likewise, a portion of the Exempt Organization’s income
from us would constitute UBTI if we held a residual interest in
a real estate mortgage investment conduit.

In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns
more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a percentage of
our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension trust
holding more than 10% of our stock only if (i) the
percentage of our income that is UBTI (determined as if we were
a pension trust) is at least 5%, (ii) we qualify as a REIT
by reason of the modification of the Five or Fewer Requirement
that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as
holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the
pension trust, and (iii) either (a) one pension trust
owns more than 25% of the value of our stock or (b) a group
of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of the
value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the value
of our stock.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.

Under
certain circumstances, you may be subject to backup withholding
at applicable rates on payments made with respect to, or cash
proceeds of a sale or



exchange of, shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply
only if you: (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer
identification number, which if you are an individual, is
ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an
incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified
by the Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to properly
report payments of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to
certify, under penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a
correct taxpayer identification number and that the Internal
Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to
backup withholding.

Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made
to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and
tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor
regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding,
and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding
is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup
withholding with respect to payment to a stockholder will be
allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s United
States federal income tax liability and may entitle such
stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information
is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition,
withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to
stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to
certify their non-foreign status.

Taxation of Foreign Stockholders.

The following summary
applies to you only if you are a foreign person. The federal
taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may
be affected by many considerations.

Except as discussed below, distributions to you of cash
generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary
dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital
assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax
at a rate of 30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that
tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower
rate.

In general, you will be subject to United States federal income
tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with
respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is
“effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade
or business in the United States. A corporate foreign
stockholder that receives income that is, or is treated as,
effectively connected with a United States trade or business may
also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in
addition to regular United States corporate income tax. The
following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose
investment in us is not so effectively connected. We expect to
withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the
gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless
(i) you file an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI
with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively
connected” or (ii) certain other exceptions apply.

Distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale
or exchange of a United States real property interest will be
taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax
Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were
gains “effectively connected” with a United States
trade or business. Accordingly, you will be taxed at the normal
capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on
these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax
and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident
alien individuals. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be
subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate
foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption.

We will be required to withhold from distributions subject to
FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of
designated capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the
amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital
gain dividends. In addition, if we designate prior distributions
as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions, up to the
amount of the prior distributions not withheld against, will be
treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.

For taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, any
capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is
“regularly traded” on an established securities market
will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign
stockholder did not own more than 5% of such class of stock at
any time during the taxable year. Once this provision takes
effect, foreign stockholders generally will not be required to
report distributions received from us on U.S. federal
income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends
for U.S. federal income tax purposes including any capital
gain dividend will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax
(unless



reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as discussed
above. In addition, the branch profits tax will no longer apply
to such distributions.

Unless our shares constitute a “United States real property
interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively
connected with a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our
shares by you generally will not be subject to United States
taxation. Our shares will not constitute a United States real
property interest if we qualify as a “domestically
controlled REIT.” We do, and expect to continue to, qualify
as a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled
REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing
period less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or
indirectly by foreign stockholders. However, if you are a
nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States
for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain
other conditions apply, you will be subject to a 30% tax on such
capital gains. In any event, a purchaser of our shares from you
will not be required under FIRPTA to withhold on the purchase
price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded”
on an established securities market or if we are a domestically
controlled REIT. Otherwise, under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be
required to withhold 10% of the purchase price and remit such
amount to the Internal Revenue Service.

Backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally
not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States
that are treated as (i) dividends to which the 30% or lower
treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies;
(ii) capital gains dividends; or (iii) distributions
attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of
U.S. real property interests. Payment of the proceeds of a
sale of stock within the United States or conducted through
certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is subject to
both backup withholding and information reporting unless the
beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or
she is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have
actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a
U.S. person) or otherwise established an exemption. You may
obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund
with the Internal Revenue Service.

U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Depositary
    Shares

Owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were
owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the
depositary shares. Thus, you will be required to take into
account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled
if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock.

Conversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred Stock.

No
gain or loss will be recognized upon the withdrawal of preferred
stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax basis of
each share of preferred stock will, upon exchange, be the same
as the aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged.
If you held your depositary shares as a capital asset at the
time of the exchange for shares of preferred stock, the holding
period for your shares of preferred stock will include the
period during which you owned the depositary shares.

U.S. Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of
    Our Debt Securities

The following is a general summary of the United States federal
income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder
that is a non-U.S. holder, as defined below, the United
States federal estate tax consequences, of purchasing, owning
and disposing of debt securities periodically offered under one
or more indentures, the forms of which have been filed as
exhibits to this registration statement (the “notes”).
This summary assumes that you hold the notes as capital assets.
This summary applies to you only if you are the initial holder
of the notes and you acquire the notes for a price equal to the
issue price of the notes. The issue price of the notes is the
first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold
other than to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement
agents or wholesalers. In addition, this summary does not
consider any foreign, state, local or other tax laws that may be
applicable to us or a purchaser of the notes.



U.S. Holders

The following summary applies to you only if you are a
U.S. holder, as defined below.

Definition of a U.S. Holder.

A
“U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a note or
notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes:

Payments of Interest.

Stated interest on the notes
generally will be taxed as ordinary interest income from
domestic sources at the time it is paid or accrues in accordance
with your method of accounting for tax purposes.

Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Notes.

The
adjusted tax basis in your note acquired at a premium will
generally be your cost. You generally will recognize taxable
gain or loss when you sell or otherwise dispose of your notes
equal to the difference, if any, between:

•

the amount realized on the sale or other disposition, less any
    amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will be
    taxable in the manner described under “— Payments
    of Interest” above; and

•

your adjusted tax basis in the notes.

Your gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. This
capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if
at the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the
notes for more than one year. Subject to limited exceptions,
your capital losses cannot be used to offset your ordinary
income.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.

In general,
“backup withholding” may apply to any payments made to
you of principal and interest on your note, and to payment of
the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your note before
maturity, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder and
(1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification
number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your
social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer
identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments
of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under
penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer
identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has
not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.

The amount of any reportable payments, including interest, made
to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of
tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be
reported to you and to the Internal Revenue Service for each
calendar year. You should consult your tax advisor regarding
your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and
the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable.
The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be
credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability,
provided that correct information is provided to the Internal
Revenue Service.

Non-U.S. Holders

The following summary applies to you if you are a beneficial
owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above
(a “non-U.S. holder”).

Special rules may apply to certain non-U.S. holders such as
“controlled foreign corporations,” “passive
foreign investment companies” and “foreign personal
holding companies.” Such entities are encouraged to



consult their tax advisors to determine the United States
federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be
relevant to them.

U.S. Federal Withholding Tax.

Subject to the
discussion below, U.S. federal withholding tax will not
apply to payments by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as
such, of principal and interest on your notes under the
“portfolio interest” exception of the Internal Revenue
Code, provided that:

•

us or our paying agent; or

•

a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial
    institution that holds customers’ securities in the
    ordinary course of its trade or business and holds your notes on
    your behalf and that certifies to us or our paying agent under
    penalties of perjury that it, or the bank or financial
    institution between it and you, has received from you your
    signed, written statement and provides us or our paying agent
    with a copy of such statement.

Treasury regulations provide that:

•

if you are a foreign partnership, the certification requirement
    will generally apply to your partners, and you will be required
    to provide certain information;

•

if you are a foreign trust, the certification requirement will
    generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners depending
    on whether you are a “foreign complex trust,”
    “foreign simple trust,” or “foreign grantor
    trust” as defined in the Treasury regulations; and

•

look-through rules will apply for tiered partnerships, foreign
    simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts.

If you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, you should
consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these
Treasury regulations and the certification requirements
applicable to you.

If you cannot satisfy the portfolio interest requirements
described above, payments of interest will be subject to the 30%
United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a
properly executed (1) Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN claiming an exemption from or reduction in
withholding under the benefit of an applicable treaty or
(2) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI stating that
interest paid on the note is not subject to withholding tax
because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade
or business in the United States. Alternative documentation may
be applicable in certain circumstances.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States
and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct
of that trade or business, you will be required to pay United
States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis
(although you will be exempt from the 30% withholding tax
provided the certification requirement described above is met)
in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as
otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a
foreign corporation, you may be required to pay a branch profits
tax on the earnings and profits that are effectively connected
to the conduct of your trade or business in the United States.



Sale, Exchange or other Disposition of Notes.

You
generally will not have to pay U.S. federal income tax on
any gain or income realized from the sale, redemption,
retirement at maturity or other disposition of your notes,
unless:

•

in the case of gain, you are an individual who is present in the
    United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year
    of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific
    other conditions are met;

•

you are subject to tax provisions applicable to certain United
    States expatriates; or

•

the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a
    U.S. trade or business.

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States
and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected
with the conduct of that trade or business, you generally will
be subject to U.S. income tax on a net basis on the gain.
In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be
subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected
earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for
certain items.

U.S. Federal Estate Tax.

If you are an individual
and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the United
States, as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax
purposes, at the time of your death, your notes will generally
not be subject to the U.S. federal estate tax, unless, at
the time of your death (1) you owned actually or
constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of
all our classes of stock entitled to vote or (2) interest
on the notes is effectively connected with your conduct of a
U.S. trade or business.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.

Backup
withholding will not apply to payments of principal or interest
made by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as such, to you
if you have provided the required certification that you are a
non-U.S. holder as described in
“— U.S. Federal Withholding Tax” above,
and provided that neither we nor our paying agent have actual
knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as described in
“— U.S. Holders” above. We or our
paying agent may, however, report payments of interest on the
notes.

The gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes may be
subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If
you sell your notes outside the United States through a
non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker and the sales
proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then the
U.S. backup withholding and information reporting
requirements generally will not apply to that payment. However,
U.S. information reporting, but not backup withholding,
will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment
is made outside the United States, if you sell your notes
through a non-U.S. office of a broker that:

You should consult your own tax advisor regarding application of
backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the
availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from
backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules from a payment to you will be allowed as a
refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax
liability, provided the required information is furnished to the
Internal Revenue Service.



U.S. Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of
    Our Warrants

Exercise of Warrants.

You will not generally recognize
gain or loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your basis in the
debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or common
stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise of the
warrant will be equal to the sum of your adjusted tax basis in
the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding period in
the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or
common stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise of
the warrant will not include the period during which the warrant
was held by you.

Expiration of Warrants.

Upon the expiration of a warrant,
you will recognize a capital loss in an amount equal to your
adjusted tax basis in the warrant.

Sale or Exchange of Warrants.

Upon the sale or exchange
of a warrant to a person other than us, you will recognize gain
or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in
the warrant. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the warrant was held
for more than one year. Upon the sale of the warrant to us, the
Internal Revenue Service may argue that you should recognize
ordinary income on the sale. You are advised to consult your own
tax advisors as to the consequences of a sale of a warrant to us.

Potential Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax
    Consequences

Current and prospective securities holders should recognize that
the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us
may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative
action at any time and that any such action may affect
investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing
with federal income taxation are constantly under review by
persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal
Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in
revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of
established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in
federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could
adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.

Internet Access to Our SEC Filings

Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments
to those reports, as well as our proxy statements and other
materials that are filed with, or furnished to, the Securities
and Exchange Commission are made available, free of charge, on
our Internet Web site at www.hcreit.com, as soon as reasonably
practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission.



Item 2.

Properties

Our headquarters are currently located at One SeaGate,
Suite 1500, Toledo, Ohio 43604. The following table sets
forth certain information regarding the facilities that comprise
our investments as of December 31, 2004:



(1)

Investments include real estate investments and credit
    enhancements which amounted to $2,447,233,000 and $5,645,000,
    respectively.

(2)

Reflects contract rate of interest for loans, annual
    straight-line rent for leases with fixed escalators or annual
    cash rent for leases with contingent escalators, excluding
    investments on non-accrual.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In previous years, we reported on Doctors Community Healthcare
Corporation (“DCHC”) and certain subsidiaries
(collectively with DCHC, “Doctors”) and Doctors’
confirmed plan of reorganization. We also previously reported
that, as part of that plan, we made loans to Pacifica of the
Valley Corporation (“Pacifica”) and PACIN
Healthcare-Hadley Memorial Hospital Corporation
(“Hadley”). Effective January 18, 2005, DCHC and
certain affiliates entered into a $45,000,000 credit facility
with a third-party lender and replaced certain outstanding debt
owed to the liquidating trust (which was established pursuant to
the confirmed plan of reorganization) with a $10,000,000
promissory note. As part of this transaction, we increased the
loans to Pacifica and Hadley by $6,600,000 (the Pacifica loan is
$11,000,000 and the Hadley loan is $17,800,000). The Pacifica
loan and Hadley loan are cross defaulted, cross collateralized
and secured by the two facilities operated by Hadley and
Pacifica, as well as related equipment and fixtures. The loans
bear interest at 9.5%, begin amortizing immediately and mature
in 2011. However, we will receive interest payments at a rate of
7.87% until the earlier of the date the liquidating trust is
paid off or the date specified financial covenants are met, with
the balance of the unpaid interest paid thereafter. The
principal payments also increase after the debt to the
liquidating trust is paid off. The loans are guaranteed by DCHC,
Paul Tuft and Erich Mounce.

From time to time, there are other various legal proceedings
pending to which we are a party or to which some of our
properties are subject arising in the normal course of business.
We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
    Stockholder Matters and Issuer Repurchases of Equity
    Securities

There were 5,708 stockholders of record as of February 28,
2005. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated,
the high and low prices of our common stock on the New York
Stock Exchange, as reported on the Composite Tape, and dividends

Our Board of Directors approved a new quarterly dividend rate of

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the
consolidated financial statements of Health Care REIT, Inc.
for the periods presented and should be read together with the
notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other important factors are identified in
“Item 1 — Business” above.

Executive Overview

Business

Health Care REIT, Inc. is a self-administered, equity real
estate investment trust that invests in health care facilities,
primarily skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. We
also invest in specialty care facilities. Founded in 1970, we
were the first REIT to invest exclusively in health care
facilities. As of December 31, 2004, long-term care
facilities, which include skilled nursing and assisted living
facilities, comprised approximately 93% of our investment
portfolio. The following table summarizes our portfolio as of

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholders’ capital
and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash
dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase
dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual
increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To
meet these objectives, we invest primarily in long-term care
facilities managed by experienced operators and diversify our
investment portfolio by operator and geographic location.

Substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from
operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest
earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent
our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are
dependent upon our operators’ continued ability to make
contractual rent and interest payments to us. To the extent that
our operators experience operating difficulties and are unable
to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could
be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate
this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of
methods determined by the type of health care facility and
operator. Our monitoring process includes review of monthly
financial statements for each facility, quarterly review of
operator credit, annual facility inspections and review of
covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes,
letters of credit and other collateral. In monitoring our
portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect
and analyze facility-specific data. Additionally, we conduct
extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks.
Through these monitoring and research efforts, we are typically
able to intervene at



an early stage and address payment risk, and in so doing,
support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our
investment.

In addition to our monitoring and research efforts, we also
structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. We
typically invest in or finance up to 90% of the appraised value
of a property. Operating leases and loans are normally credit
enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition,
operating leases are typically structured as master leases and
loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized
with other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and
the operator and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2004,
85% of our real property was subject to master leases, 96% of
our real estate investments were cross-defaulted with other
investments relating to the same operator and 78% of our real
property loans were cross-collateralized with other loans to the
same operator.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, rental income and
interest income represented 90% and 9%, respectively, of total
gross revenues. Prior to June 2004, our standard lease structure
contained fixed annual rental escalators, which were generally
recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease
period. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure
contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon
changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross
operating revenues of the property. These escalators are not
fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental
income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments
due for the period. This lease structure will initially generate
lower revenues, net income and funds from operations compared to
leases with fixed escalators that require straight-lining, but
will enable us to generate additional organic growth and
minimize non-cash straight-line rent over time. This change does
not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends. Our
yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors,
including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount
outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate
adjustments.

Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we
anticipate making additional investments in health care related
facilities. New investments are generally funded from temporary
borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements,
internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real
property. Our investments generate internal cash from rent and
interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable.
Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds
drawn under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements, is
expected to be provided through a combination of public and
private offerings of debt and equity securities and the
incurrence of secured debt. We believe our liquidity and various
sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations,
meet debt service obligations (both principal and interest),
make dividend distributions and finance future investments.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new
investments will be available in the future with spreads over
our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to
our stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2004,
we completed $584,931,000 of gross new investments and had
$62,584,000 of real property sales and mortgage loan payoffs,
resulting in net investments of $522,347,000. We previously
issued investment guidance indicating that we anticipated net
new investments of $250,000,000 in 2005. We recently adjusted
our net new investment guidance for 2005 to $200,000,000, due to
the anticipated disposition of two investments totaling
approximately $50,000,000 that were not in the original
guidance. Although no additional investment payoffs have been
specifically identified, we anticipate the potential repayment
of certain mortgage loans receivable and the possible sale of
additional real property. To the extent that mortgage loan
repayments and real property sales exceed new investments, our
revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely
affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any mortgage
loan repayments and real property sales in new investments. To
the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available
cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured lines of
credit arrangements. At December 31, 2004, we had
$19,763,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $189,000,000 of
available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit
arrangements.



Key Transactions in 2004

We completed the following key transactions during the year
ended December 31, 2004:

Key Performance Indicators, Trends and
    Uncertainties

We utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the
various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed
below and relate to operating performance, concentration risk
and credit strength. Management uses these key performance
indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to
our historical operating results, in making operating decisions
and for budget planning purposes.

Operating Performance.

We believe that net income
available to common stockholders (“NICS”) is the most
appropriate earnings measure. Other useful supplemental measures
of our operating performance include funds from operations
(“FFO”) and funds available for distribution
(“FAD”); however, these supplemental measures are not
defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Please refer to the
section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for
further discussion of FFO and FAD and for reconciliations of FFO
and FAD to NICS. NICS, FFO, FAD and their relative per share
amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the
valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of
companies. The following table reflects the recent historical
trends for our operating performance measures (dollars in
thousands, except per share data):

Credit Strength.

We measure our credit strength both in
terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. Our leverage
ratios include debt to book capitalization (“DBCR”)
and debt to market capitalization (“DMCR”). The
leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet
capitalization is related to long-term debt. We expect to
maintain a DBCR between 40% and 50% and a DMCR between 30% and
40%. Our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio
(“ICR”) and fixed charge coverage ratio
(“FCR”). The coverage ratios indicate our ability to
service interest and fixed charges (interest plus preferred
dividends). We expect to maintain an ICR in excess of 3.00 times
and an FCR in excess of 2.50 times. The coverage ratios are
based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (“EBITDA”) which is discussed in further
detail, and reconciled to net income, below in “Non-GAAP
Financial Measures.” Leverage ratios and coverage ratios
are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in
the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations
of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical
trends for our credit strength measures:

Concentration Risk.

We evaluate our concentration risk in
terms of asset mix, investment mix, operator mix and geographic
mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding
what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain
sectors were to experience downturns. Asset mix measures the
portion of our investments that are real property. In order to
qualify as an equity REIT, at least 75% of our real estate
investments must be real property whereby each property, which
includes the land, buildings, improvements and related rights,
is owned by us and leased to an operator pursuant to a long-term
operating lease. Investment mix measures the portion of our
investments that relate to our various facility types. We invest
primarily in long-term care facilities. Operator mix measures
the portion of our investments that relate to our top five
operators. We try to limit our top five operators to 50% of our
total real estate investments. Geographic mix measures the
portion of our investments that relate to our top five states.
We try to limit our top five states to 50% of our total real
estate investments. The following table reflects our recent
historical trends of concentration risk:



We evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with
current expectations to determine if historical trends are
indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be
achieved and actual results may differ materially from our
expectations. This may be a result of various factors,
including, but not limited to:



•

structure related factors, including REIT qualification,
    anti-takeover provisions and key management personnel.

Management regularly monitors the economic and other factors
listed above. We develop strategic and tactical plans designed
to improve performance and maximize our competitive position.
Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent
upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to
appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific
trends. Please refer to “Forward-Looking Statements and
Risk Factors” below for further discussion of these risk
factors.

Assisted Living Portfolio.

At December 31, 2004, our
assisted living portfolio was comprised of 234 facilities with
15,776 units and an investment balance of $1,335,717,000.
The stabilized portfolio was comprised of 230 facilities with
15,115 units, an investment balance of $1,298,820,000, and
payment coverage of 1.45 times, an increase of 14 basis
points from the prior year. Our fill-up and construction
properties remained within our stated goal of having no more
than 10% to 15% of the portfolio in construction and fill-up. We
currently have two assisted living facilities remaining in
fill-up, representing less than 1% of our revenues. Only one
facility has occupancy of less than 50%. Finally, we have two
assisted living facilities in construction.

Skilled Nursing Portfolio.

At December 31, 2004, our
skilled nursing portfolio was comprised of 152 facilities with
20,975 beds and an investment balance of $965,328,000. Average
occupancies have risen from a low of 81% in the third quarter of
2000 to 87% in the third quarter of 2004. Our payment coverage
remains strong at 2.11 times, an increase of 36 basis
points from the prior year.

Specialty Care Portfolio.

At December 31, 2004, our
specialty care portfolio was comprised of eight facilities with
1,111 beds and an investment balance of $151,833,000. Our
payment coverage remains strong at 2.69 times, an increase
of 77 basis points from the prior year.

Corporate Governance

Maintaining investor confidence and trust has become
increasingly important in today’s business environment.
Health Care REIT, Inc.’s Board of Directors and
management are strongly committed to policies and procedures
that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices.
Our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for
our business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase
stockholder value while meeting all applicable legal
requirements. In March 2004, the Board of Directors adopted its
Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines meet the
listing standards adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and are
available on our Web site at www.hcreit.com and from us upon
written request sent to the Vice President and Corporate
Secretary, Health Care REIT, Inc., One SeaGate, Suite 1500,
P.O. Box 1475, Toledo, Ohio, 43603-1475.

On July 30, 2002, President George W. Bush signed into
law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”). SOX is
designed to protect investors by improving the accuracy and
reliability of corporate disclosures. SOX directed the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to
promulgate all necessary rules and regula-



tions. We believe we are in compliance with all of the new
listing guidelines of the NYSE relating to corporate governance
as well as the applicable provisions of SOX and the rules of the
SEC adopted under SOX. The following is a summary of some of the
important SOX related corporate governance initiatives for which
we are compliant.



•

Disclosures regarding committee functions and communications
    between security holders and the Board — beginning
    with the 2004 Proxy Statement, we have made the required
    disclosures regarding the independence and functions of the
    committees of the Board of Directors and have provided our
    security holders with information so they can communicate with
    our Board of Directors or any specific director.

In addition to the items discussed above, the SEC has issued its
final rules regarding compliance with SOX Section 404,
Management Assessment of Internal Controls (“SOX404”).
Pursuant to SOX404, we must develop enhanced procedures to
understand, document, evaluate and monitor our internal controls
and procedures for financial statement purposes. Beginning with
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2004, we must provide an assessment report
from management on the effectiveness of our internal controls.
In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm
must attest to and report on management’s assertions. See
“Item 9A — Controls and Procedures”
below for additional information. We implemented a SOX404
compliance plan in April 2003 and have completed all necessary
documentation and testing of our internal controls in time to
provide the required management report for the current year. To
date, we have incurred costs (both internal and external)
related to SOX404 and other corporate governance compliance
initiatives and we anticipate that we will incur additional
costs. These costs are included in general and administrative
expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts,
borrowings under unsecured lines of credit arrangements, public
and private offerings of debt and equity securities, proceeds
from the sales of real property and principal payments on loans
receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend
distributions, debt service payments (including principal and
interest), real property acquisitions, loan advances and general
and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of cash are
reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are
discussed in further detail below. The following is a summary of
our sources and uses of cash flows (dollars in thousands):

Operating Activities.

The increases in net cash provided
from operating activities are primarily attributable to
increases in net income and the provision for depreciation
offset by changes in receivables and other assets. Net income
and the provision for depreciation increased primarily as a
result of net new investments in properties owned by us. See the
discussion of investing activities below for additional details.
To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional
properties in the future, our provision for depreciation will
change accordingly. Changes in receivables and other assets are
primarily due to timing of cash receipts relating to rent, debt
service and other contractual obligations and the fair value of
our interest rate swap agreements.



Investing Activities.

The increases in net cash used in
investing activities are primarily attributable to increases in
net real property investments. At December 31, 2004, 90% of
our real estate investments were real property investments. The
investment activity during the year ended December 31, 2004
was approximately 95% real property investments and 5% loans.
Investments for the year ended December 31, 2004 included
the acquisition of 22 assisted living facilities and
52 skilled nursing facilities for $518,891,000, including
the assumption of debt totaling $14,555,000. The remaining
$38,211,000 of real property investments relates primarily to
funding of construction and renovations on existing facilities.
Of this amount, $9,523,000 related to construction advances on
two assisted living facilities. For the same period in 2003, we
acquired 69 assisted living facilities and 26 skilled nursing
facilities for $474,385,000. The prior year acquisitions
included the assumption of debt totaling $101,243,000 and the
issuance of preferred stock totaling $26,500,000, resulting in
$346,643,000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions. In
addition, we advanced $63,770,000 relating to construction and
renovations on existing facilities. Of this amount, $29,496,000
related to construction advances on three assisted living
facilities and one specialty care facility. We converted
$36,794,000 of completed construction projects relating to one
assisted living facility and the specialty care facility into
operating lease properties in 2003. For the same period in 2002,
we acquired 24 assisted living facilities, 21 skilled nursing
facilities and one specialty care facility for $354,672,000. The
2002 acquisitions included the assumption of debt which reduced
the amount funded by $2,248,000, resulting in $352,424,000 of
cash disbursed for the acquisitions. In addition, we advanced
$57,282,000 relating to construction and renovations on existing
facilities. Of this amount, $19,595,000 related to construction
advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty
care facility.

Financing Activities.

The changes in net cash provided
from or used in financing activities are primarily attributable
to changes related to our long-term debt, preferred stock
issuances and redemptions, common stock issuances and cash
distributions to stockholders. In September 2002, we issued
$150,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in
September 2012, at an effective yield of 8.05%. In March 2003,
we issued $100,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes,
maturing in September 2012, at an effective yield of 7.40%.
These notes were an add-on to the $150,000,000 senior unsecured
notes issued in September 2002. In November 2003, we issued
$250,000,000 of 6.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in
November 2013, at an effective yield of 6.01%. In September
2004, we issued $50,000,000 of 6.0% senior unsecured notes,
maturing in November 2013, at an effective yield of 5.68%. These
notes were an add-on to the $250,000,000 senior unsecured notes
issued in November 2003. We extinguished $40,000,000 of
8.0% senior unsecured notes that matured in April 2004.

There was no preferred stock activity for the year ended
December 31, 2002. In July 2003, we closed on a public
offering of 4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, which generated net
proceeds of approximately $96,850,000. The shares have a
liquidation value of $25 per share. The preferred stock,
which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us on or after
July 9, 2008. A portion of the proceeds from this offering
were used to redeem all 3,000,000 shares of our 8.875%
Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on
July 15, 2003, at a redemption price of $25 per share
plus accrued and unpaid dividends.

In September 2003, we issued 1,060,000 shares of 6%
Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred
Stock as partial consideration for an acquisition of assets by
us, with the shares valued at $26,500,000 for such purposes. The
shares were issued to Southern Assisted Living, Inc. and certain
of its shareholders without registration in reliance upon the
federal statutory exemption of Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The shares have a
liquidation value of $25 per share. The preferred stock,
which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us on or after
August 15, 2008. The preferred shares are convertible into
common stock at a conversion price of $32.66 per share at
any time. As of December 31, 2004, certain holders of our
Series E Preferred Stock have converted 709,955 shares
into 543,438 shares of our common stock, leaving 350,045 of
such shares outstanding at December 31, 2004.

In September 2004, we closed on a public offering of
7,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series F Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock, which generated net proceeds of
approximately $169,107,000. The shares have a liquidation value
of $25 per share. The preferred stock, which has no stated
maturity, may be redeemed by us



on or after September 14, 2009. The proceeds were used to
repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit
arrangements and to invest in additional health care properties.

The change in common stock issuances is primarily attributable
to public and private issuances in 2002 and 2003. In February
2002, we issued 906,000 shares of common stock, $1 par
value, at a price of $27.59 per share, which generated net
proceeds of approximately $23,657,000. In May 2002, we issued
3,450,000 shares of common stock, $1 par value, at a
price of $28.00 per share, which generated net proceeds of
approximately $91,578,000. In November 2002, we issued
930,000 shares of common stock, $1 par value, at a
price of $26.90 per share, which generated net proceeds of
approximately $24,952,000.

In July 2003, we issued 1,583,100 shares of common stock,
$1 par value, at a price of $30.32 per share, which
generated net proceeds of approximately $47,950,000. In
September 2003, we issued 3,200,000 shares of common stock,
$1 par value, at a price of $30.25 per share, which
generated net proceeds of approximately $91,583,000. In October
2003, we issued an additional 480,000 shares of common
stock pursuant to the over-allotment exercise, which generated
net proceeds of approximately $13,795,000.

The remaining difference in common stock issuances is primarily
related to our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan
(“DRIP”), stock option exercises, restricted stock
grants and preferred stock conversions. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, we issued 355,000 shares of common
stock pursuant to our DRIP, which generated net proceeds of
$9,572,000. In May 2003, we instituted our enhanced DRIP.
Existing stockholders, in addition to reinvesting dividends, may
purchase up to $5,000 of common stock per month at a discount.
Previously, stockholders could only purchase once per quarter.
During the year ended December 31, 2004, we issued
1,533,000 shares of common stock pursuant to our DRIP,
which generated net proceeds of approximately $51,575,000 as
compared to 2,277,000 shares issued and $68,860,000 of net
proceeds generated for the same period in 2003. As of
February 28, 2005, we had an effective registration
statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under which we may issue up to 6,314,213 shares of common
stock pursuant to our DRIP. As of February 28, 2005,
4,357,361 shares of common stock remained available for
issuance under this registration statement.

In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding
capital gains) to our stockholders. During the year ended
December 31, 2004, we paid dividends totaling $122,987,000
(or $2.385 per share) and $12,737,000 to holders of our
common stock and preferred stock, respectively. For the same
periods in 2003, we paid dividends totaling $101,863,000 (or
$2.34 per share) and $9,218,000 to holders of our common
stock and preferred stock, respectively. For the same periods in
2002, we paid dividends totaling $84,671,000 (or $2.34 per
share) and $12,468,000 to holders of our common stock and
preferred stock, respectively. The increase in common stock
dividends is primarily attributable to the increase in common
stock outstanding as discussed below in “Results of
Operations.”

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have guaranteed the payment of industrial revenue bonds for
one assisted living facility in the event that the present owner
defaults upon its obligations. In consideration for this
guaranty, we receive and recognize fees annually related to this
arrangement. This guaranty expires upon the repayment of the
industrial revenue bonds which currently mature in 2009. At
December 31, 2004, we were contingently liable for
$3,195,000 under this guaranty.

We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit
of certain insurance companies that provide workers’
compensation insurance to one of our tenants. Our obligation
under the letter of credit matures in 2009. At December 31,
2004, our obligation under the letter of credit was $2,450,000.

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may or
may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge
interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on
our policy to match our variable rate investments with
comparable borrowings, but are also based on the general trend
in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of
the future volatility of interest rates. As of December 31,
2004, we participated in two interest rate swap



agreements related to our long-term debt. Our interest rate
swaps are discussed below in “Contractual Obligations.”

Contractual
Obligations

The following table summarizes our payment requirements under
contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 (in
thousands):

(1)

Unsecured lines of credit arrangements reflected at 100%
    capacity.

We have an unsecured credit arrangement with a consortium of
eight banks providing for a revolving line of credit
(“revolving credit”) in the amount of $310,000,000,
which expires on May 15, 2006 (with the ability to extend
for one year at our discretion if we are in compliance with all
covenants). The agreement specifies that borrowings under the
revolving credit are subject to interest payable in periods no
longer than three months at either the agent bank’s prime
rate of interest or 1.3% over LIBOR interest rate, at our option
(3.7375% at December 31, 2004). In addition, we pay a
commitment fee based on an annual rate of 0.325% and an annual
agent’s fee of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of
the agreement. We have another unsecured line of credit
arrangement with a consortium of three banks for a total of
$30,000,000, which expires May 31, 2005. Borrowings under
this line of credit are subject to interest at either the lead
bank’s prime rate of interest (5.25% at December 31,
2004) or 2.0% over LIBOR interest rate, at our option, and are
due on demand. At December 31, 2004, we had $151,000,000
outstanding under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements and
estimated total contractual interest obligations of $6,410,000.
Contractual interest obligations are estimated based on the
assumption that the balance of $151,000,000 at December 31,
2004 is constant until maturity at interest rates in effect at
December 31, 2004.

We have $875,000,000 of senior unsecured notes with fixed annual
interest rates ranging from 6% to 8.17%, payable semi-annually.
Total contractual interest obligations on senior unsecured notes
totaled $394,191,000 at December 31, 2004. Additionally, we
have 32 mortgage loans totaling $160,225,000, collateralized by
health care facilities, with fixed annual interest rates ranging
from 5.5% to 12%, payable monthly. The carrying values of the
health care properties securing the mortgage loans totaled
$233,591,000 at December 31, 2004. Total contractual
interest obligations on mortgage loans totaled $139,454,000 at
December 31, 2004.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps
are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we
utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The
Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a
fixed rate of 6% and pay a



variable rate based on six-month LIBOR plus a spread. At
December 31, 2004, total contractual interest obligations
were estimated to be $31,320,000.

At December 31, 2004, we had operating lease obligations of
$16,036,000 relating to our office space, six assisted living
facilities and three skilled nursing facilities.

Purchase obligations are comprised of unfunded construction
commitments and contingent purchase obligations. At
December 31, 2004, we had outstanding construction
financings of $26,183,000 ($25,463,000 for leased properties and
$720,000 for construction loans) and were committed to providing
additional financing of approximately $3,833,000 to complete
construction. At December 31, 2004, we had contingent
purchase obligations totaling $82,815,000. These contingent
purchase obligations primarily relate to deferred acquisition
fundings. Deferred acquisition fundings are contingent upon a
tenant satisfying certain conditions in the lease. Upon funding,
amounts due from the tenant are increased to reflect the
additional investment in the property.

Capital Structure

As of December 31, 2004, we had stockholders’ equity
of $1,335,279,000 and a total outstanding debt balance of
$1,186,225,000, which represents a debt to total book
capitalization ratio of 47%. Our ratio of debt to market
capitalization was 34% at December 31, 2004. For the year
ended December 31, 2004, our coverage ratio of EBITDA to
interest was 3.24 to 1.00. For the year ended December 31,
2004, our coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges was 2.77 to
1.00. Also, at December 31, 2004, we had $19,763,000 of
cash and cash equivalents and $189,000,000 of available
borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit
arrangements.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and
events of default. Among other things, these provisions require
us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth
and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of
December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all of the
covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements
contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by
our debt ratings. However, under our unsecured lines of credit
arrangements, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used
to determine the fees and interest payable.

Our senior unsecured notes are rated Baa3 (stable), BBB-
(stable) and BBB- (positive) by Moody’s Investors
Service, Standard and Poor’s Investor Service and Fitch
Ratings, respectively. We plan to manage the Company to maintain
investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with
our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or
outlook by any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a
material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital,
which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/ or financial
condition.

As of February 28, 2005, we had an effective shelf
registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under which we may issue up to $356,794,619 of
securities including debt securities, common and preferred
stock, depositary shares, warrants and units. We filed a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on December 1, 2004 for the issuance of up to
$1,081,794,619 of securities to replace the existing shelf
registration. We anticipate that this shelf registration will be
effective in the first half of 2005. Also, as of
February 28, 2005, we had an effective registration
statement on file in connection with our enhanced DRIP program
under which we may issue up to 6,314,213 shares of common
stock. As of February 28, 2005, 4,357,361 shares of
common stock remained available for issuance under this
registration statement. Depending upon market conditions, we
anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements
to invest in additional health care facilities and to repay
borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements.

Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended
December 31, 2004 totaled $72,634,000, or $1.39 per
diluted share, as compared with $70,732,000, or $1.60 per
diluted share, for the same period in 2003 and $55,191,000, or
$1.48 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Net
income available to common stockholders increased on a
year-to-date basis primarily due to an increase in rental income
offset by increases in interest expense and provision for
depreciation. These changes are discussed in further detail
below. Although net income available to common stockholders
increased by 3% from 2003 and 32% from 2002, it decreased on a
per share basis primarily due to significantly higher
outstanding shares. On a fully diluted basis, average common
shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2004
were 52,082,000, an 18% increase from 44,201,000 for the same
period in 2003 and a 40% increase from 37,301,000 for the same
period in 2002. The increase in fully diluted average common
shares outstanding is primarily the result of public and private
common stock offerings, common stock issuances pursuant to our
DRIP and conversions of preferred stock into common stock. The
following table represents the changes in outstanding common
stock for the period from January  1, 2003 to
December 31, 2004 (amounts in thousands):

FFO for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled
$146,742,000, or $2.82 per diluted share, as compared with
$119,463,000, or $2.70 per diluted share, for the same
period in 2003 and $96,573,000, or $2.59 per diluted share,
for the same period in 2002. The increase in FFO is primarily
due to increases in net income available to common stockholders
and the provision for depreciation. FAD for the year ended
December 31, 2004 totaled $132,950,000, or $2.55 per
diluted share, as compared to $104,535,000, or $2.36 per
diluted share, for the same period in 2003 and $87,317,000, or
$2.34 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. The
increase in FAD is primarily due to increases in net income
available to common stockholders and the provision for
depreciation offset by changes in rental income in excess of
cash received. Please refer to the discussion of “Non-GAAP
Financial Measures” below for further information regarding
FFO and FAD and for reconciliations of FFO and FAD to NICS.

EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled
$238,264,000, as compared with $199,349,000 for the same period
in 2003 and $155,208,000 for the same period in 2002. The
increase in EBITDA is primarily due to increases in net income,
interest expense and provision for depreciation. Our coverage
ratio of EBITDA to total interest was 3.24 times for the year
ended December 31, 2004 as compared with 3.50 times for the
same period in 2003 and 3.67 times for the same period in 2002.
Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges was 2.77 times for
the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with 3.01
times for the same period in 2003 and 2.84 times for the same
period in 2002. Our coverage ratios declined from the prior
years primarily due to the fact that interest expense increased
29% to $73,431,000 from $56,912,000 in 2003 and



74% from $42,271,000 in 2002, whereas EBITDA only increased by
20% from 2003 and 54% from 2002. The increase in interest
expense is discussed in further detail below. Please refer to
the discussion of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below
for further information regarding EBITDA and a reconciliation of
EBITDA and net income.

The increase in gross revenues is primarily attributable to
increased rental income resulting from the acquisitions of new
properties for which we receive rent offset by sales of real
property. Investments for the year ended December 31, 2004
included the acquisition of 22 assisted living facilities and 52
skilled nursing facilities for $518,891,000, including the
assumption of debt totaling $14,555,000. The remaining
$38,211,000 of real property investments related primarily to
funding of construction and renovations on existing facilities.
Of this amount, $9,523,000 related to construction advances on
two assisted living facilities. For the same period in 2003, we
acquired 69 assisted living facilities and 26 skilled nursing
facilities for $474,385,000. However, the prior year
acquisitions included the assumption of debt totaling
$101,243,000 and the issuance of preferred stock totaling
$26,500,000, resulting in $346,643,000 of cash disbursed for the
acquisitions. In addition, we advanced $63,770,000 relating to
construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this
amount, $29,496,000 related to construction advances on three
assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility. We
converted $36,794,000 of completed construction projects
relating to one assisted living facility and the specialty care
facility into operating lease properties in 2003. For the same
period in 2002, we acquired 24 assisted living facilities, 21
skilled nursing facilities and one specialty care facility for
$354,672,000. However, the 2002 acquisitions included the
assumption of debt which reduced the amount funded by
$2,248,000, resulting in $352,424,000 of cash disbursed for the
acquisitions. In addition, we advanced $57,282,000 relating to
construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this
amount, $19,595,000 related to construction advances on three
assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility.
During the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold four
assisted living facilities, two skilled nursing facilities and
one specialty care facility, generating $37,567,000 of net
proceeds. For the same period in 2003, we sold 14 assisted
living facilities, two skilled nursing facilities and one parcel
of land, generating $65,455,000 of net proceeds. For the same
period in 2002, we sold nine assisted living facilities,
generating $52,279,000 of net proceeds.

As discussed above, prior to June 2004, our standard lease
structure contained fixed annual rental escalators, which were
generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum
lease period. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease
structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent
upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the
gross operating revenues of the property. These escalators are
not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental
income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments
due for the period. While this change does not affect our cash
flow or our ability to pay dividends, it is anticipated that we
will generate additional organic growth and minimize non-cash
straight-line rent over time. If gross operating revenues at our
facilities and/or the Consumer Price Index do not increase, a
portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Sales of
real property would offset revenue increases and, to the extent
that they exceed new acquisitions, could result in decreased
revenues. Our leases could renew above or below current rent
rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. As
of December 31, 2004, we had no leases expiring prior to
2009.



Interest income decreased from 2002 primarily due to lower
average yields on our loans receivable and non-recognition of
interest income related to loans on non-accrual. Interest income
increased from 2003 primarily due to a full year of interest
income on loans made in 2003 and recognition of interest income
related to our mortgage loans with Doctors Community Healthcare
Corporation as a result of the bankruptcy resolution.
Transaction fees and other income fluctuated primarily due to
the $902,000 gain from the sale of our investment in Atlantic
Healthcare Finance L.P. in October 2003 and the resulting lack
of income subsequent to the date of sale.

Expenses were comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):

The increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to
increases in interest expense, the provision for depreciation
and general and administrative expenses. The increases in
interest expense are primarily due to higher average borrowings
and changes in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting
interest expense. This was partially offset by lower average
interest rates and savings generated from interest rate swap
agreements. In September 2002, we issued $150,000,000 of
8.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in September 2012, at
an effective yield of 8.05%, resulting in 12 months of
expense in the current year as compared to three months of
expense in 2002 and 12 months of expense in 2003. In March
2003, we issued $100,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured
notes, maturing in September 2012, at an effective yield of
7.40%, resulting in nine months of interest expense in 2003
compared to 12 months of expense in the current year. In
November 2003, we issued $250,000,000 of 6.0% senior
unsecured notes, maturing in November 2013, resulting in
12 months of expense in the current year as compared to no
expense in 2002 and one month of expense in 2003. In September
2004, we issued $50,000,000 of 6.0% senior unsecured notes,
maturing in November 2013, at an effective yield of 5.68%
resulting in three months of expense in the current year as
compared to no expense in the prior years. Additionally, during
the year ended December 31, 2004 we had an average daily
outstanding balance of $54,770,000 under our unsecured lines of
credit arrangements compared to $61,677,000 and $69,180,000
during the same periods in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Also, in
2004, we assumed $14,555,000 of secured debt with weighted
average interest rates of 7.50% in conjunction with new
acquisitions. In 2003, we assumed $101,243,000 of secured debt
with weighted average interest rates of 7.39% in conjunction
with new acquisitions. In 2002, we assumed $2,248,000 of secured
debt with weighted average interest rates of 7.75% in
conjunction with new acquisitions. Effective April 15,
2004, we repaid our $40,000,000 8.0% senior unsecured
notes, which will result in a decrease of interest expense of
$3,200,000 on an annualized basis. If we borrow under our
unsecured lines of credit arrangements, issue additional senior
unsecured notes or assume additional secured debt, our interest
expense will increase.

We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used
to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us.
The amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding
during the construction period using the rate of interest that
approximates our cost of financing. Our interest expense is
reduced by the amount capitalized. Capitalized interest for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 totaled
$170,000, $1,535,000 and $875,000, respectively.



On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps
are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we
utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The
Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a
fixed rate of 6.0% and pay a variable rate based on six-month
LIBOR plus a spread. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
we generated $1,770,000 of savings related to our Swaps that was
recorded as a reduction of interest expense. We had no interest
rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2003 or
December 31, 2002.

The provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result
of additional investments in properties owned directly by us
offset by sales of real property. See the discussion of rental
income above for additional details. To the extent that we
acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our
provision for depreciation will change accordingly.

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues
(including revenues from discontinued operations) for the year
ended December 31, 2004, were 6.54% as compared with 5.55%
and 5.79% for the same periods in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Approximately one-half of the increases from 2002 and 2003 are
related to costs associated with our initiatives to attract and
retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives.
The remainder is comprised of increases relating to professional
services fees (including costs associated with SOX compliance),
taxes and transition costs associated with the removal of an
underperforming operator in December 2004.

The increase in loan expense was primarily due to the additional
amortization of costs related to amending our primary unsecured
line of credit arrangement, costs related to obtaining consents
to modify the covenant packages of our senior unsecured notes
and costs related to senior unsecured notes issued in 2003 and
2004.

In May 2003, we announced the amendment and extension of our
primary unsecured line of credit arrangement. The line of credit
was expanded to $225,000,000 and extended to expire in May 2006
(with the ability to extend for one year at our discretion if we
are in compliance with all covenants). In August 2003, we
further amended the line of credit to modify certain financial
covenants that enhanced our financial flexibility and aligned
our covenant package with other investment-grade REITs. Finally,
in December 2003 and January 2004, we expanded this line of
credit to $310,000,000.

In August and September 2003, we solicited the consents of
registered holders of our senior unsecured notes to the adoption
of certain amendments to the supplemental indentures to modify
the indentures to require us to (a) limit the use of
secured debt to 40% of undepreciated assets, (b) limit
total debt to 60% of undepreciated total assets, and
(c) maintain total unencumbered assets at 150% of total
unsecured debt. These amendments to all of our then outstanding
senior unsecured notes were intended to modernize the covenant
package and make it consistent with other investment-grade REITs.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, it was determined
that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did
not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge
of $314,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated
fair market value. The estimated fair market value was
determined by an offer to purchase received from a third party.
During the year ended December 31, 2003, it was determined
that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did
not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge
of $2,792,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its
estimated fair market value. The estimated fair market value of
the property was determined by an independent appraisal. During
the year ended December 31, 2002, it was determined that
the projected undiscounted cash flows from three properties did
not exceed their related net book values and impairment charges
of $2,298,000 were recorded to reduce the properties to their
estimated fair market values. The estimated fair market values
of the properties were determined by offers to purchase received
from third parties or estimated net sales proceeds.



In April 2002, we purchased $35,000,000 of our outstanding
senior unsecured notes that were due in 2003 and recorded a
charge of $403,000 in connection with this early extinguishment.
No such transactions or charges occurred in 2003 or 2004.

The provision for loan losses is related to our critical
accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is
discussed below in “Critical Accounting Policies.” Due
to collectibility concerns related to portions of our loan
portfolio, we increased our allowance for losses on loans
receivable by an additional $1,870,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, we
sold properties with carrying values of $53,311,000, $61,316,000
and $37,710,000 for net losses of $1,032,000, net gains of
$4,139,000 and net losses of $143,000, respectively. In August
2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. We adopted the standard effective
January 1, 2002. In accordance with Statement No. 144,
we have reclassified the income and expenses attributable to the
properties sold subsequent to January 1, 2002 to
discontinued operations. These properties generated $7,207,000,
$4,088,000 and $641,000 of income after deducting depreciation
and interest expense from rental revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Please
refer to Note 15 of our audited consolidated financial
statements for further discussion.

The increase in preferred dividends is primarily due to the
increase in average outstanding preferred shares. We issued
3,000,000 shares of 8.875% Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock in May 1998, and
3,000,000 shares of 9.0% Series C Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock in January 1999. We issued
4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock in July 2003 and used the proceeds to
redeem our outstanding Series B Preferred Stock. We issued
7,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series F Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock in September 2004. During the year
ended December 31, 2002, the holder of our Series C
Preferred Stock converted 900,000 shares into
878,049 shares of our common stock, leaving 2,100,000 of
such shares outstanding at December 31, 2002. During the
year ended December 31, 2003, the holder of our
Series C Preferred Stock converted 2,100,000 shares
into 2,048,781 shares of our common stock, leaving no such
shares outstanding at December 31, 2003. We issued
1,060,000 shares of 6% Series E Cumulative Convertible
and Redeemable Preferred Stock in September 2003. During the
year ended December 31, 2003, certain holders of our
Series E Preferred Stock converted 229,556 shares into
175,714 shares of our common stock, leaving 830,444 of such
shares outstanding at December 31, 2003. During the year
ended December 31, 2004, certain holders of our
Series E Preferred Stock converted 480,399 shares into
367,724 shares of our common stock, leaving 350,045 of such
shares outstanding at December 31, 2004.

As noted above, in July 2003, we closed a public offering of
4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock. A portion of the proceeds from this
offering were used to redeem all 3,000,000 shares of our
8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on
July 15, 2003. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force (“EITF”) Topic D-42, the costs to issue these
securities were recorded as a non-cash, non-recurring charge of
$2,790,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the third
quarter of



2003 to reduce net income available to common stockholders. No
such transactions or charges occurred in 2002 or 2004.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the
most appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider FFO
and FAD to be useful supplemental measures of our operating
performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets
in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the
value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as
evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real
estate values have historically risen or fallen with market
conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered
presentations of operating results for real estate companies
that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In
response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“NAREIT”) created FFO as a supplemental
measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes
historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by
NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real
estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
FAD represents FFO excluding the non-cash straight-line rental
adjustments. Additionally, our historical results include an
adjustment for a preferred stock redemption charge for the year
ended December 31, 2003 but exclude adjustments for
impairment charges.

In August 2003, we adopted the SEC clarification of EITF
Topic D-42. To implement the clarified accounting
pronouncement, our 2003 results reflect a reduction in net
income available to common stockholders resulting from a
non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2,790,000, or $0.06 per
diluted share, due to the redemption of our 8.875% Series B
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in July 2003. NAREIT has
issued its recommendation that preferred stock redemption
charges should not be added back to net income in the
calculation of FFO. Although we have adopted this
recommendation, we have also disclosed FFO and FAD adjusted for
the preferred stock redemption charge for enhanced clarity.
Additionally, we believe that the nature of the charge is
non-recurring because there was not a similar charge during the
two preceding years and we do not anticipate a similar charge in
the succeeding two years.

In October 2003, NAREIT informed its member companies that the
SEC had changed its position on certain aspects of the NAREIT
FFO definition, including impairment charges. Previously, the
SEC accepted NAREIT’s view that impairment charges were
effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an
impending sale of property and thus should be added back to net
income in the calculation of FFO and FAD similar to other gains
and losses on sales. However, the SEC’s clarified
interpretation is that recurring impairments taken on real
property may not be added back to net income in the calculation
of FFO and FAD. We have adopted this interpretation and have not
added back impairment charges of $2,298,000, or $0.06 per
diluted share, recorded for the year ended December 31,
2002, $2,792,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, recorded for
the year ended December 31, 2003 and $314,000, or
$0.01 per diluted share, recorded for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization. Additionally, we exclude the non-cash
provision for loan losses in calculating EBITDA. We believe that
EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from
operating activities, is an important supplemental measure
because it provides additional information to assess and
evaluate the performance of our operations. Additionally,
restrictive covenants in our long-term debt arrangements contain
financial ratios based on EBITDA. We primarily utilize EBITDA to
measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA
divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio,
which represents EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges
include total interest and preferred dividends.

FFO, FAD and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used
by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in
the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations
of companies. Management uses these financial measures to
facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical
operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget
planning purposes. Additionally, FFO and FAD are internal
evaluation metrics utilized by the Board of Directors to
evaluate management. FFO, FAD and EBITDA do not represent net
income or cash flow provided from operating activities as



determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be
considered as alternative measures of profitability or
liquidity. Finally, FFO, FAD and EBITDA, as defined by us, may
not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other
real estate investment trusts or other companies.

The table below reflects the reconciliation of FFO to net income
available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable
U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented. The provision
for depreciation includes provision for depreciation from
discontinued operations. Amounts are in thousands except for per
share data.



The table below reflects the reconciliation of FAD to net income
available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable
U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented. The provision
for depreciation includes provision for depreciation from
discontinued operations. Amounts are in thousands except for per
share data.



The table below reflects the reconciliation of EBITDA to net
income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for
the periods presented. The provision for depreciation and
interest expense includes provision for depreciation and
interest expense from discontinued operations. Amortization
includes amortization of deferred loan expenses, restricted
stock and stock options. Dollars are in thousands.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and
assumptions. Management considers an accounting estimate or
assumption critical if:

•

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to
    the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for
    highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters
    to change; and

•

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial
    condition or operating performance is material.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its
critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
disclosure presented below relating to them. Management believes
the current assumptions and other considerations used to
estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial
statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to
change in the future. However, since these estimates require
assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the
estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual
experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations
used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated
financial statements, the resulting changes could have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Please refer
to Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements
for further information on significant accounting policies that
impact us. There have been no



material changes to these policies in 2004, except for the new
policy regarding the fair value of derivative instruments.

We adopted the fair value-based method of accounting for
share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the
prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition
and Disclosure. Because Statement 123(R) must be applied
not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are
not fully vested on the effective date of Statement 123(R),
and because we adopted Statement 123 using the prospective
transition method (which applied only to awards granted,
modified or settled after the adoption date of
Statement 123), compensation cost for some previously
granted awards that were not recognized under Statement 123
will be recognized under Statement 123(R). However, had we
adopted Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of
that standard would have approximated the impact of
Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma
net income and earnings per share in Note 9 to our audited
consolidated financial statements. We do not expect the adoption
of Statement 123(R) to have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

The following table presents information about our critical
accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to
develop each estimate:



Impact of Inflation

During the past three years, inflation has not significantly
affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate.
Additionally, our earnings are primarily long-term investments
with fixed rates of return. These investments are mainly
financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes
and borrowings under our lines of credit arrangements. During
inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising
interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected
because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower
rate than new borrowing costs. Presuming the current inflation
rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not
increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not
impact the availability of equity and debt financing.



Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents
incorporated by reference contain statements that constitute
“forward-looking statements” as that term is defined
in the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements
include those regarding:

For example, when we use words such as “may,”
“will,” “intend,” “should,”
“believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“estimate” or similar expressions, we are making
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not
guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
uncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and
actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This
may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited
to:



Risk factors related to our operators’ revenues and
    expenses

Our skilled nursing and specialty care facility operators’
revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursement and private pay rates. Our assisted
living facility operators’ revenues are primarily driven by
occupancy and private pay rates. Expenses for these three types
of facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food,
utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues
from government reimbursement have, and may continue, to come
under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget
shortfalls. Liability insurance and staffing costs continue to
increase for our operators. To the extent that any decrease in
revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in a
facility not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the
credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would
have to be relied upon.

Risk factors related to operator bankruptcies

We are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to
meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,
which may result in an operator bankruptcy or insolvency, or
that an operator might become subject to bankruptcy or
insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating
lease agreements provide us the right to evict an operator,
demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies,
and our mortgage loans provide us the right to terminate any
funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and
unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other
remedies, the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party
that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An operator in
bankruptcy may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect
unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid
principal and interest in the case of a mortgage loan, and to
exercise other rights and remedies.

We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate
taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of a facility,
avoid the imposition of liens on a facility and/or transition a
facility to a new operator. In some instances, we have
terminated our lease with an operator and relet the facility to
another operator. In some of those situations, we provided
working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new
operator. If we cannot transition a leased facility to a new
operator, we may take possession of that facility, which may
expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events
occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely
affected. See “Item 3 — Legal
Proceedings” above.

Risk factors related to government regulations

Our operators’ businesses are affected by government
reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that any
skilled nursing or specialty care facility receives a
significant portion of its revenues from governmental payors,
primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to
statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments,
recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, administrative
rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by
fiscal intermediaries, government funding restrictions (at a
program level or with respect to specific facilities) and
interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing
governmental investigations and audits at such facility. In
recent years, governmental payors have frozen or reduced
payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures.
Changes in health care reimbursement will likely continue to be
of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We
cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect
any future legislative reforms may have on the financial
condition of the skilled nursing industry, the specialty care
industry or the health care industry in general. There can be no
assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be
available for services provided by any facility operator,
whether the facility receives reimbursement from Medicare,
Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of
services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could
have a material adverse effect on an operator’s liquidity,
financial condition and results of operations, which could
adversely affect the ability of an operator to meet its
obligations to us. In addition, the replacement of an operator
that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the
approval process of any federal, state or local agency necessary
for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the
operator licensed to manage the facility. See
“Item 1 — Business — Certain
Government Regulations — Reimbursement” above.



Risk factors related to liability claims and insurance
    costs

Long-term care facility operators (assisted living and skilled
nursing facilities) have experienced substantial increases in
both the number and size of patient care liability claims in
recent years, particularly in the states of Texas and Florida.
As a result, general and professional liability costs have
increased and may continue to increase. Nationwide, long-term
care liability insurance rates are increasing because of large
jury awards in states like Texas and Florida. Over the past two
years, both Texas and Florida have adopted skilled nursing
facility liability laws that modify or limit tort damages.
Despite some of these reforms, the long-term care industry
overall continues to experience very high general and
professional liability costs. Insurance companies have responded
to this claims crisis by severely restricting their capacity to
write long-term care general and professional liability
policies. No assurances can be given that the climate for
long-term care general and professional liability insurance will
improve in any of the foregoing states or any other states where
the facility operators conduct business. Insurance companies may
continue to reduce or stop writing general and professional
liability policies for assisted living and skilled nursing
facilities. Thus, general professional liability insurance
coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely
affect the facility operators’ future operations, cash
flows and financial condition, and may have a material adverse
effect on the facility operators’ ability to meet their
obligations to us.

Risk factors related to acquisitions

We are exposed to the risk that our future acquisitions may not
prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated
difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired
properties, including contingent liabilities, and newly acquired
properties might require significant management attention that
would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree
to provide construction funding to an operator and the project
is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion
of the project or we could lose the property. Moreover, if we
issue equity securities or incur additional debt, or both, to
finance future acquisitions, it may reduce our per share
financial results. These costs may negatively affect our results
of operations.

Risk factors related to environmental laws

Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of
real estate may be required to respond to the release of
hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for
property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from
environmental contamination. These laws also expose us to the
possibility that we may become liable to reimburse the
government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with
the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a
person based on the person’s relationship to the property.
Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the
condition of the property and since we are a passive landlord,
we do not “participate in the management” of any
property in which we have an interest. Moreover, we review
environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or
encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments
are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry”
standard, which qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense
if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments,
we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to
material environmental contamination. However, environmental
liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur
costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Risk factors related to reinvestment of sale
    proceeds

From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the
proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments
on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,
including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master
leases or similar financial support arrangements. We must
re-invest these proceeds, on a timely basis, in health care
investments or in qualified short-term investments. We compete
for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential
investors. This competition for attractive investments may
negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on
terms acceptable to us. Delays in acquiring properties may
negatively impact revenues and perhaps our ability to make
distributions to stockholders.



Risk factors related to our structure

We are also subject to a number of risks on the corporate level.
First, we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code
and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a
manner. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of
complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill
them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount
of federal taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect
the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. Also, if we
were not a REIT, we would not be required to make distributions
to stockholders since a non-REIT is not required to pay
dividends to stockholders amounting to at least 90% of its
annual taxable income. See “Item 1 —
Business — Taxation” for a discussion of the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that apply to us and the
effects of non-qualification.

Second, our Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Amended and Restated By-Laws contain anti-takeover provisions
(staggered board provisions, restrictions on share ownership and
transfer, and super majority stockholder approval requirements
for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for
or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the
approval of our incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and
agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could
reduce the market value of our common stock.

Third, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we have
entered into employment agreements with our executive officers,
losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have an
adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more
than one would have a material adverse impact on our business.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We seek to
mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by
matching the terms of new investments with new long-term fixed
rate borrowings to the extent possible. We may or may not elect
to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate
exposure. These decisions are principally based on our policy to
match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings,
but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the
applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of
interest rates. The following section is presented to provide a
discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations
in interest rates.

We historically borrow on our unsecured lines of credit
arrangements to make acquisitions of, loans to, or to construct
health care facilities. Then, as market conditions dictate, we
will issue equity or long-term fixed rate debt to repay the
borrowings under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements.

A change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense
associated with our fixed rate debt. Interest rate changes,
however, will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt. A 1%
increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair
value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately $28,025,000
at December 31, 2004 ($31,473,000 at December 31,
2003). Changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of
this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash
flows and earnings, depending on whether the debt is replaced
with other fixed rate debt, variable rate debt, or equity or
repaid by the sale of assets.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps
are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we
utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The
Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a
fixed rate of 6.0% and pay a variable rate based on six-month
LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2004, the Swaps were
reported at their fair value as a $4,206,000 other asset. A 1%
increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair
value of our Swaps by approximately $7,382,000 at
December 31, 2004. We had no interest rate swap agreements
outstanding at December 31, 2003.

Our variable rate debt, including our unsecured lines of credit
arrangements, is reflected at fair value. At December 31,
2004, we had $151,000,000 outstanding related to our variable
rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances, a 1%
increase in interest rates would result in increased annual
interest expense of $1,510,000. At December 31, 2003, we
did not have any borrowings outstanding related to our variable
rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances, a 1%
increase in interest rates would have had no effect on annual
interest expense.

We are subject to risks associated with debt financing,
including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be
refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as
favorable as the terms of current indebtedness. The majority of
our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual
agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.
Accordingly, in the event that we are unable to raise additional
equity or borrow money because of these limitations, our ability
to acquire additional properties may be limited.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Stockholders and Directors

Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Health Care REIT, Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedules listed in
Item 15(a)(2) of this Form 10-K. These financial
statements and schedules are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Health Care REIT, Inc. at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements, in 2003 the Company adopted the provisions of
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Health Care REIT, Inc.’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Accounting Policies and Related Matters

Industry

We are a self-administered, equity real estate investment trust
that invests primarily in long-term care facilities, which
include skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. We also
invest in specialty care facilities.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries after the
elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and
transactions.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

Loans Receivable

Loans receivable consist of mortgage loans, construction loans,
working capital loans and subdebt investments. Interest income
on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount
outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectibility risks.
The mortgage loans are primarily collateralized by a first or
second mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage on or assignment of
partnership interest in the related facilities. Working capital
loans are loans made to operators of facilities and are
typically either secured and/or guaranteed. Subdebt investments
represent debt instruments to operators of facilities that have
been financed by us. These obligations are generally secured by
the operator’s leasehold rights and corporate guaranties.

Real Property Owned

The cost of our real property is allocated to land, buildings,
improvements and intangibles in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business
Combinations. The allocation of the acquisition costs of
properties is based on appraisals commissioned from independent
real estate appraisal firms. Substantially all of the properties
owned by us are leased under operating leases and are recorded
at cost. These properties are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to
40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for
improvements. The net book value of long-lived assets is
reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine
if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be
impaired or that the depreciable life may need to be changed. We
consider external factors relating to each asset. If these
external factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of
the asset over the remaining depreciation period indicate that
the asset will not be recoverable, the carrying value will be
adjusted to the estimated fair market value. The leases
generally extend for a minimum seven-year period and provide for
payment of all taxes, insurance and maintenance by the tenants.
Prior to June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed
annual rental escalators, which are generally recognized on a
straight-line basis over the minimum lease period subject to an
evaluation of collectibility risks. This income is greater than
the amount of cash received during the first half of the lease
term. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure
contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon
changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross
operating revenues of the property. These escalators are not
fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental
income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments
due for



HEALTH CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the period. We recognized $922,500 of contingent rental income
for the year ended December 31, 2004. We did not recognize
any contingent rental income for the years ended
December 31, 2002 or 2003.

Capitalization of Construction Period Interest

We capitalize interest costs associated with funds used to
finance the construction of properties owned directly by us. The
amount capitalized is based upon the balance outstanding during
the construction period using the rate of interest which
approximates our cost of financing.

We capitalized interest costs of $875,000, $1,535,000, and
$170,000, during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to
construction of real property owned by us. Our interest expense
reflected in the consolidated statements of income has been
reduced by the amounts capitalized.

Deferred Loan Expenses

Deferred loan expenses are costs incurred by us in connection
with the issuance and amendments of short-term and long-term
debt. We amortize these costs over the term of the debt using
the straight-line method, which approximates the interest yield
method.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed
adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The
determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly
evaluation of these loans, including general economic conditions
and estimated collectibility of loan payments. We evaluate the
collectibility of our loans receivable based on a combination of
factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status,
historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower
and guarantors and value of the underlying property. If such
factors indicate that there is greater risk of loan charge-offs,
additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be
required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information
and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all
amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of
the original loan agreement. Consistent with this definition,
all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. At
December 31, 2004, we had loans with outstanding balances
of $35,918,000 on non-accrual status ($30,523,000 at
December 31, 2003). To the extent circumstances improve and
the risk of collectibility is diminished, we will return these
loans to full accrual status. While a loan is on non-accrual
status, any cash receipts are applied against the outstanding
balance.

Equity Investments

We had an investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P., a
property group that specializes in the financing, through sale
and leaseback transactions, of nursing and care homes located in
the United Kingdom. This investment was accounted for using the
equity method of accounting because we had the ability to
exercise significant influence, but not control, over the
investee due to our 31% ownership interest. In October 2003, we
sold our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P.
generating a net gain of $902,000.

Other equity investments, which consist of investments in
private and public companies for which we do not have the
ability to exercise influence, are accounted for under the cost
method. Under the cost method of accounting, investments in
private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for
other-than-temporary declines in fair value, distributions of
earnings and additional investments. For investments in public
companies that have readily determinable fair market values, we
classify our equity investments as available-for-sale and,
accordingly, record these investments at their fair market
values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated
other comprehensive income, a separate component of
stockholders’ equity. These investments represent a minimal
ownership interest in these companies.



HEALTH CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Foreign Currency Translation

For fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the functional currency of our
investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P. was the local
currency. The income and expenses of the entity were translated
into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the
reporting period to derive our equity earnings. Translation
adjustments were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity. As
noted above, we sold this investment in October 2003.

Transaction Fees

Transaction fees are earned by us for our agreement to provide
direct and standby financing to, and credit enhancement for,
owners and operators of health care facilities. We amortize
transaction fees over the initial fixed term of the lease, the
loan or the construction period related to such investments.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

Accumulated other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains
or losses on our equity investments and foreign currency
translation adjustments. Accumulated unrealized gains and losses
totaled $1,000, $1,000 and $12,000 at December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Due to the sale of our investment
in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P. in October 2003, accumulated
foreign currency translation adjustments totaled $0, $0 and
($182,000) at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. These items are included as components of
stockholders’ equity.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential
loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may or
may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge
interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on
our policy to match our variable rate investments with
comparable borrowings, but are also based on the general trend
in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of
the future volatility of interest rates.

In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement No. 138, Accounting
for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities, which amends Statement No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Statement
No. 133, as amended, requires companies to record
derivatives at fair market value on the balance sheet as assets
or liabilities.

On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap
agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount
of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to
changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate
debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps
are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we
utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement
No. 133, as amended. The Swaps are with highly rated
counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 6.0% and pay
a variable rate based on six-month LIBOR plus a spread. At
December 31, 2004, the Swaps were reported at their fair
value as a $4,206,000 other asset. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, we generated $1,770,000 of savings
related to the Swaps that was recorded as a reduction in
interest expense. We had no interest rate swap agreements
outstanding at December 31, 2003 or 2002.

The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are estimated by a
third party consultant, which utilizes pricing models that
consider forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts
and the recognition of such amounts are subject to significant
estimates which may change in the future.



HEALTH CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Net Income Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
of shares outstanding for the period adjusted for non-vested
shares of restricted stock. The computation of diluted earnings
per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that
the number of shares is increased to include the number of
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

Federal Income Tax

No provision has been made for federal income taxes since we
have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust
under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
and we believe that we have met the requirements for
qualification as such for each taxable year. See Note 11.

New Accounting Standards

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation
of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (the
“Interpretation”). The Interpretation requires the
consolidation of variable interest entities in which an
enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected
losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected
residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual
or other financial interests in the entity. Previously, entities
were generally consolidated by an enterprise that had a
controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority
voting interest in the entity. We have performed a quantitative
analysis for certain variable interests in our operators and
determined that none of the operators’ businesses are
variable interest entities because the fair value of the equity
of these businesses exceeds the expected losses as calculated.
In addition to our quantitative analysis, our evaluation also
included an analysis of aspects of our operators’
businesses, such as involvement in the day to day decision
making of the operators’ businesses, ownership or voting
rights in any of these businesses and participation in the
profits or losses of such businesses, to further determine the
absence of a controlling financial interest in the context of
the Interpretation.

We adopted the fair value-based method of accounting for
share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the
prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition
and Disclosure. Currently, we use the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option
grants and expect to continue to use this acceptable option
valuation model upon the required adoption of Statement 123(R)
on July 1, 2005. Because Statement 123(R) must be
applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards
that are not fully vested on the effective date of
Statement 123(R), and because we adopted Statement 123
using the prospective transition method (which applied only to
awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date of
Statement 123), compensation cost for some previously
granted awards that were not recognized under Statement 123
will be recognized under Statement 123(R). However, had we
adopted Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of
that standard would have approximated the impact of
Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma
net income and earnings per share in Note 9. We do not
expect the adoption of Statement 123(R) to have a material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

months for directors to five years for officers and key salaried
employees. Options expire ten years from the date of grant. We
granted 112,000, 110,000, and 8,000 restricted shares during
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including 10,000, 12,000, and
8,000 shares for directors in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Expense, which is recognized as the shares vest
based on the market value at the date of the award, totaled
$2,887,000, $2,157,000 and $1,555,000, in 2004, 2003 and 2002,

Unamortized restricted stock represents the unamortized value of
restricted stock granted to employees and directors prior to
January 1, 2003. Expense related to these grants, which is
recognized as the shares vest based on the market value at the
date of the award, totaled $949,000, $1,182,000 and $1,555,000
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure, which we are
required to adopt for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2002, with transition provisions for certain
matters. Statement 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, Statement 148 amends the
disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we commenced
recognizing compensation expense in accordance with
Statement 123 on a prospective basis. Accumulated
compensation expense related to stock options represents the
amount of amortized compensation costs related to stock options
awarded to employees and directors subsequent to January 1,
2003.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income
available to common stockholders if we had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of Statement 123 to
stock-based compensation for options granted since 1995 but
prior to adoption at January 1, 2003 (in thousands, except

Preferred Stock

In July 2003, we closed a public offering of
4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation
value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly
in arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity,
may be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per
share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the
redemption date, on or after July 9, 2008. A portion of the
proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all
3,000,000 shares of our 8.875% Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock on July 15, 2003, at a
redemption price of $25.00 per share plus accrued and
unpaid dividends. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
Topic D-42, the costs to issue the Series B Preferred Stock
were recorded as a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2,790,000,
or $0.06 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2003 to
reduce net income available to common stockholders.

In September 2003, we issued 1,060,000 shares of 6%
Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred
Stock as partial consideration for an acquisition of assets by
the Company, with the shares valued at $26,500,000 for such
purposes. The shares were issued to Southern Assisted Living,
Inc. and certain of its stockholders without registration in
reliance upon the federal statutory exemption of
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The
shares have a liquidation value of $25.00 per share.
Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock,
which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us at a
redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and
unpaid dividends thereon to the redemption date, on or after
August 15, 2008. The preferred shares are convertible into
common stock at a conversion price of $32.66 per share at
any time. During the year ended December 31, 2004, certain
holders of our Series E Preferred Stock converted
480,399 shares into 367,724 shares of our common
stock, leaving 350,045 of such shares outstanding at
December 31, 2004.

In September 2004, we closed a public offering of
7,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series F Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation
value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly
in arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity,
may be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per
share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the
redemption date, on or after September 14, 2009.

Income Taxes and Distributions

To qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income
tax purposes, 90% of taxable income (including 100% of capital
gains) must be distributed to stockholders. Real estate
investment trusts that do not distribute a certain amount of
current year taxable income in the current year are also subject
to a 4% federal excise tax. The principal reasons for the
difference between undistributed net income for federal income
tax purposes and financial statement purposes are the
recognition of straight-line rent for reporting

Commitments and Contingencies

We have guaranteed the payment of industrial revenue bonds for
one assisted living facility, in the event that the present
owner defaults upon its obligations. In consideration for this
guaranty, we receive and recognize fees annually related to this
arrangement. This guaranty expires upon the repayment of the
industrial revenue bonds which currently mature in 2009. At
December 31, 2004, we were contingently liable for
$3,195,000 under this guaranty.

We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit
of certain insurance companies that provide workers’
compensation insurance to one of our tenants. Our obligation
under the letter of credit matures in 2009. At December 31,
2004, our obligation under the letter of credit was $2,450,000.

At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding construction
financings of $26,183,000 ($25,463,000 for leased properties and
$720,000 for construction loans) and were committed to providing
additional financing of approximately $3,833,000 to complete
construction. At December 31, 2004, we had contingent
purchase obligations totaling $82,815,000. These contingent
purchase obligations primarily relate to deferred acquisition
fundings. Deferred acquisition fundings are contingent upon an
operator satisfying certain conditions such as payment coverage
and value tests. Amounts due from the tenant are increased to
reflect the additional investment in the property.

At December 31, 2004, we had operating lease obligations of
$16,036,000 relating to Company office space, six assisted
living facilities and three skilled nursing facilities. We
incurred rental expense relating to our Company office space of
$292,000, $348,000 and $213,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Regarding
the facility leases, we have sublease agreements with certain of
our operators that require the operators to reimburse us for our
monthly operating lease obligations. At December 31, 2004,
aggregate future minimum rentals to be received under these
noncancelable subleases totaled $14,509,000. At
December 31, 2004, future minimum lease payments due under
operating leases are as follows (in thousands):

The diluted earnings per share calculation excludes the dilutive
effect of 112,000, 0 and 10,000 options for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, because the exercise price was greater than the
average market price. The Series C Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock was not included in the calculations for 2002
and 2003 as the effect of the conversions was anti-dilutive. The
Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred
Stock was not included in the calculations for 2003 and 2004 as
the effect of the conversions was anti-dilutive.

Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it
is practicable to estimate that value.

Mortgage Loans Receivable

— The fair value of
all mortgage loans receivable is estimated by discounting the
future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans
would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for
the same remaining maturities.

Working Capital Loans, Construction Loans and Subdebt
Investments

— The carrying amount is a reasonable
estimate of fair value based on the interest rates received,
which approximates current market rates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The carrying amount
approximates fair value.

Equity Investments

— Equity investments are
recorded at their fair market value.

Borrowings Under Lines of Credit Arrangements

—
The carrying amount of the lines of credit arrangements
approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate
adjustable.

Senior Unsecured Notes

— The fair value of the
senior unsecured notes payable was estimated by discounting the
future cash flows using the current borrowing rate available to
the Company for similar debt.



HEALTH CARE REIT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Mortgage Loans Payable

— Mortgage loans payable
is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the interest
rates paid, which approximates current market rates.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

— Our interest
rate swap agreements are recorded as assets or liabilities on
the balance sheet at fair market value. Fair market value is
estimated by a third party consultant, which utilizes pricing
models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial
instruments are as follows (in thousands):

Discontinued Operations

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001. We adopted the
standard effective January 1, 2002.

During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, we
sold properties with carrying values of $53,311,000, $61,316,000
and $37,710,000 for net losses of $1,032,000, net gains of
$4,139,000 and net losses of $143,000, respectively. In
accordance with Statement No. 144, we have reclassified the
income and expenses attributable to these properties to
discontinued operations. Expenses include an allocation of
interest expense based on property carrying values and our
weighted average cost of debt. The following illustrates the
reclassification impact of Statement No. 144 as a result of
classifying the properties as discontinued operations (in

Retirement Arrangements

We have a Retirement Plan and Trust (the “401(k)
Plan”) covering all eligible employees. Under the 401(k)
Plan, eligible employees may make contributions, and we may make
matching contributions and a profit sharing contribution. Our
contributions to this 401(k) Plan totaled $289,000, $206,000 and
$184,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

We have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(“SERP”), a non-qualified defined benefit pension
plan, which provides certain executive officers with
supplemental deferred retirement benefits. The SERP provides an
opportunity for participants to receive retirement benefits that
cannot be paid under our tax-qualified Plan because of the
restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. Benefits are based on compensation and length
of service and the SERP is unfunded. No company contributions
are anticipated for the 2005 fiscal year. No benefit payments
are expected to occur during the next five fiscal years and
total $470,000 during the succeeding five fiscal years. We use a
December 31 measurement date for the SERP. The accrued
liability on our balance sheet for the SERP was $703,000 at
December 31, 2004 ($412,000 at December 31, 2003).

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the

Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and

this report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended). The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 based on the criteria established by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in a report entitled Internal Control — Integrated
Framework. Based on that assessment, management believes that
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective as of December 31, 2004.

The registered independent public accounting firm of
Ernst & Young LLP, as auditors of the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation
report on management’s assessment of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) occurred during the fourth quarter of the
one-year period covered by this report that materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Stockholders and Directors

Health Care REIT, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Health Care REIT, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Health Care REIT Inc.’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Health Care
REIT, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
opinion, Health Care REIT, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Health Care REIT, Inc. as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004 of Health Care REIT, Inc. and our report
dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.
