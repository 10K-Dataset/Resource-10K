Corn
                Processing

The
                Company is engaged in wet milling and dry milling corn operations.
                Products produced for use in the food and beverage industry include
                syrup,
                starch, glucose, dextrose, and sweeteners.  Dextrose is also
                produced
                for use by the Company as a feedstock for its bioproducts
                operations. Corn gluten feed and meal as well as distillers
                grains
                are produced for use as feed ingredients. Corn germ, a by-product
                of the
                milling process, is further processed as an oilseed into vegetable
                oil and
                meal.

By
                fermentation of dextrose, the Company produces alcohol, amino acids,

                to
                beverage grade or for industrial use as ethanol. In gasoline, ethanol
                increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate. Amino
                acids,
                such as lysine and threonine, are vital compounds used in swine feeds
                to
                produce leaner animals, and in poultry feeds to enhance the speed
                and
                efficiency of poultry production. The Company also produces, by
                fermentation, astaxanthin, a product used in aquaculture to enhance
                flesh
                coloration. The Company produces citric and lactic acids, lactates,
                sorbitol and xanthan gum which are used in various food and industrial
                products.

Status
                of new products

The
                Company continues to expand its business through the development
                and
                production of new, value-added products. A new line of trans-free
                fats and
                oils is being marketed under the NovaLipid™ brand using enzymatic
                interesterification technology. This portfolio of new products allows
                margarines, shortenings and other products to be produced with near
                zero
                levels of trans-fatty acids. This year the NovaLipid™ enzymatic
                interesterification technology won national recognition through two
                awards
                that it received. The first award was the American Oil Chemists Society’s
                corporate achievement award which was given for the commercial application
                of lipases to produce commodity low trans-fats. Secondly, the
                Environmental Protection Agency’s Green Chemistry process award was given
                to the enzymatic interesterification technology because of its
                environmental benefits over traditional chemical interesterification.
                This
                enzymatic interesterification technology was expanded this past year
                with
                additional production units for cocoa butter substitutes as
                well
                as for trans-free fats. A number of customers have
                launched
                trans-free margarines and other products using the NovaLipid™
                enzymatically interesterified
                products.

                  latex paint
                  dries. During the drying process of a conventional latex paint,
                  coalescing
                  solvents soften the paint resin so that it will form a film. These
                  solvents then evaporate into the atmosphere as VOCs. The new Archer

works in a similar way, except that it becomes part of the film
                  instead of
                  evaporating, producing coatings with higher scrub resistance and
                  gloss
                  while greatly reducing or eliminating VOCs. This technology was
                  also
                  recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency this year by
                  the
                  awarding of the Presidential Green Chemistry award for a new product
                  that
                  provides benefits for the environment. This second award also marks
                  the
                  first time that any company has ever won two Presidential Green

is
                  derived from vegetable oil, a renewable resource, and will replace
                  a
                  petroleum-based solvent. Research has found additional uses for
                  this
                  product beyond its original application in latex paints and the
                  Company
                  will be attempting to further expand its markets.

Research
                  into producing biodiesel is being focused on lowering costs in
                  the process
                  as well as continuing to study a variety of fatty acid feed stocks.
                  This
                  research should lead to a low cost source of fatty acid methyl
                  esters for
                  biodiesel as well as for other products.

A
                  joint research project with Argonne National Laboratory is focused
                  on the
                  development of a separative bioreactor which utilizes the principles
                  of
                  electrodeionization (EDI) that allows the production of chemicals
                  from
                  biomass feedstocks without the production of salt byproducts. In
                  addition
                  a joint project with the Department of Energy on the utilization
                  of corn
                  fiber continues to make progress toward its ultimate use in a
                  biorefinery.

This
                  year the Company entered into a joint development alliance with
                  Metabolix
                  to produce polyhydroxy alkanoate (PHA) via fermentation.

Through
                  this alliance, the two companies are planning to establish a
                  state-of-the-art production facility and a 50/50 joint venture
                  to
                  manufacture and market natural PHA polymers for a wide variety
                  of
                  applications, including coated paper, film, and molded goods. Natural
                  PHA
                  polymers are produced using a fully-biological fermentation process
                  that
                  converts agricultural raw materials such as corn sugar into a versatile
                  range of biodegradable and compostable plastics.

Other
                  new products include a wide range of health and nutrition products
                  known
                  as nutraceuticals or functional foods. The Company acquired an
                  exclusive
                  license for flax lignan technology that may have potential for
                  health
                  maintenance and possible risk reduction of several diseases. The
                  license
                  gives the Company an exclusive, worldwide right to produce and
                  sell flax
                  lignans for use as an active ingredient in functional foods,
                  nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, animal feed additives and veterinary
                  products. Clinical trials on lignans have shown initial results
                  that look
                  promising. Commercial scale production of lignans is planned for
                  fiscal
                  2006. The Company is a leader in the processing of flaxseed. Another
                  nutraceutical that the Company is producing at a pilot scale is
                  cocoa
                  catechins. These antioxidant compounds are increasingly becoming
                  of
                  interest to nutraceutical
                  customers.

BUSINESS—Continued

The
                Company has formed a joint venture with Kao Corporation of Japan
                to
                manufacture and market diacylglycerol oil in America, Europe, Australia
                and New Zealand. This naturally derived vegetable oil can be used
                as a
                home cooking oil or as an ingredient in packaged foods. The national
                launch of this oil, Enova, occurred in January 2005 and its
                use in
                various food products continues to be developed.

The
                Company continues to develop its soy protein meat substitutes with
                Nutrisoy Next

                This product has the texture and flavor profile of chicken breast
                meat.
                Pork flavored products were introduced this year. This product has
                been
                well received in the U.K. market where it offers an alternate to
                fungal
                meat analogs. The Company is also producing a new organic soy protein
                ingredient, Nutrisoy

whole soybean soymilk powder. This product differs from traditional
                soymilks in that the fiber component of the soybean is retained in
                the
                soymilk. Commercial soymilks using this product have been launched
                in the
                marketplace.

Source
                and availability of raw materials

Substantially
                all of the Company's raw materials are agricultural commodities.
                In any
                single year, the availability and price of these commodities are
                subject
                to unpredictable factors such as weather, plantings, government (domestic
                and foreign) farm programs and policies, changes in global demand
                created
                by population growth and changes in standards of living, and global
                production of similar and competitive crops. The substantial majority
                of
                our raw materials are procured from thousands of grain elevators
                and
                wholesale merchants, principally in North America, South America
                and
                Europe pursuant to short-term agreements (less than 1 year) or on
                a “spot”
                basis. The Company does not grow crops and a relatively small proportion
                of our raw materials are purchased directly from growers. The Company
                is
                not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator or merchant or
                group of
                growers, elevators or merchants as a source for its raw
                materials.

(iv)

Patents,
                trademarks and licenses

The
                Company owns several valuable patents, trademarks and licenses, but
                does
                not consider any segment of its business dependent upon any single
                or
                group of patents, trademarks or
                licenses.

(v)

Extent
                to which business is seasonal

Since
                the Company is so widely diversified in global agribusiness markets,
                there
                are no material seasonal fluctuations in the manufacture, sale and
                distribution of its products and services. There is a degree of
                seasonality in the growing season and procurement of the Company's
                principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa beans and other
                grains. However, the actual physical movement of the millions of
                bushels
                of these crops through the Company's storage and processing facilities
                is
                reasonably constant throughout the
                year.

(vi)

Working
                capital items

Price
                variations and availability of raw agricultural commodities may cause
                fluctuations in the Company's receivables, inventories, and short-term
                borrowings.

Dependence
                on single customer

No
                material part of the Company's business in any segment is dependent
                upon a
                single customer or very few
                customers.

(viii)

Amount
                of backlog

Because
                of the nature of the Company's business, the backlog of orders at
                year end
                is not a significant indication of the Company's activity for the
                current
                or upcoming year.

(ix)

Business
                subject to renegotiation

The
                Company has no business with the government subject to
                renegotiation.

(x)

Competitive
                conditions

Markets
                for the Company's products are highly price competitive and sensitive
                to
                product substitution. No single company competes with the Company
                in all
                of its markets. However, a number of large companies compete with
                the
                Company in one or more markets. Major competitors in one or more
                markets
                include, but are not limited to, Barry Callebaut A.G., Bunge, Ltd.,
                Cargill, Inc., ConAgra, Inc., Corn Products International, Inc. and
                Tate
                & Lyle PLC.

Research
                and development expenditures

The
                Company’s research and development expenditures are focused on developing
                food, feed, and industrial products from renewable, agricultural
                crops.
                The Company uses technical services representatives to interact with
                customers to understand the customers’ product needs. These technical
                service representatives then interact with researchers who are familiar
                with the Company’s wide range of food, feed and industrial products as
                well as applications technology. These individuals form quick acting
                teams
                to develop solutions to customer needs.

The
                Company maintains a research laboratory in Decatur, Illinois where
                product
                and process development activities are conducted. To develop new
                bioproducts and to improve existing bioproducts, new cultures are
                developed using classical mutation and genetic engineering. Protein
                and
                vegetable oil research is conducted at facilities in Decatur where
                bakery,
                meat and dairy pilot plants support application research. Vegetable
                oil
                research is also conducted in Hamburg, Germany, Erith, U.K. and Arras,
                France. Research to support sales and development for bakery products
                is
                done at a laboratory in Olathe, Kansas. Research to support sales
                and
                development for cocoa and chocolate products is done in Milwaukee,
                Wisconsin and the Netherlands. Research and technical support for
                industrial and food wheat starch applications is conducted in a Montreal,
                Canada research center. The Company conducts research for corn starches
                in
                paper and textile industries as well as fuel ethanol research in
                Clinton,
                Iowa. The Company maintains research centers in Quincy, Illinois
                and
                Decatur, Indiana that conduct swine and cattle feeding trials to
                test new
                formula feed products and to develop improved feeding
                efficiencies.

Material
                effects of capital expenditures for environmental protection

During
                the year ended June 30, 2005, $63 million was spent for equipment,
                facilities and programs for pollution control and compliance with
                the
                requirements of various environmental
                agencies.

There
                have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position
                of the Company resulting from compliance with federal, state and
                local
                laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection
                of the
                environment.

The
                Company expects expenditures for environmental facilities and programs
                to
                continue at approximately the present rate with no unusual amounts
                anticipated for the next two years.

PROPERTIES

The
                Company owns or leases the following processing plants and procurement
                facilities:

The
                Company’s operations are such that most products are efficiently processed
                near the source of raw materials. Consequently, the Company has many
                plants strategically located in grain producing areas. The annual
                volume
                of commodities processed will vary depending upon availability of
                raw
                materials and demand for finished
                products.

Oilseeds
                Processing

The
                  Company operates twenty-two domestic and

twenty
                  foreign oilseed crushing plants with a daily processing capacity
                  of
                  approximately 89,000 metric tons (3.3 million bushels). The domestic
                  plants are located in Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
                  Kansas,

LEGAL
                PROCEEDINGS

ENVIRONMENTAL
      MATTERS

The
      United
      States Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”) issued a Finding of Violation
      on March 3, 2005, regarding alleged violations of the National Emission
      Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Pharmaceutical Production relating
      to
      the operation of the Company’s Vitamin E Plant in Decatur, Illinois. The alleged
      violations relate to compliance demonstrations for equipment testing and
      monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting, but do not allege any violations of
      applicable air emissions limitations. The Company met with representatives
      of
      the USEPA on April 12, 2005, to discuss the allegations, and it is likely that
      the USEPA will seek a civil penalty in excess of $1,000,000. The Company
      intends to work cooperatively with the USEPA to ensure that all applicable
      requirements are met. In management’s opinion, the civil penalty imposed will
      not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or
      results of operations.

The
      Company is involved in approximately 25 administrative and judicial proceedings
      in which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under
      the federal Superfund law and its state analogs for the study and clean-up
      of
      sites contaminated by material discharged into the environment. In all of these
      matters, there are numerous PRPs. Due to various factors such as the required
      level of remediation and participation in the clean-up effort by others, the
      Company’s future clean-up costs at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated.
      In management’s opinion, these proceedings will not, either individually or in
      the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
      condition or results of operations.

As
      of June
      30, 2005, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
      participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
      and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
      of
      the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules
      13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
      Act”)). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief
      Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the Company’s
      disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information
      required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
      under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
      the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
      forms. There was no change in the Company’s internal controls over financial
      reporting during the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has
      materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
      internal controls over financial reporting.
