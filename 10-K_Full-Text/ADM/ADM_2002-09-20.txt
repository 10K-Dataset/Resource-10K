The Company has developed a comprehensive transportation system utilizing trucks, rail, river barges and ocean-going vessels to efficiently move both commodities and processed products virtually anywhere in the world. The Company owns or leases large numbers of the trucks, trailers, railroad tank and hopper cars, river barges and towboats used in this transportation system.

(ii)	Status of new products

The Company continues to expand its business through the development and production of new, value-added products. These new products include a wide-range of health and nutrition products known as nutraceuticals or functional foods. The Company acquired an exclusive license for flax lignan technology that may have potential for health maintenance and possible risk reduction of several diseases. The license gives the Company an exclusive, worldwide right to produce and sell flax lignans for use as an active ingredient in functional foods, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, animal feed additives and veterinary products. Pillot scale quantities of this product have been produced to support clinical trials of this product. The Company is a leader in the processing of flaxseed.

The company as a whole is developing synergies between its different divisions to provide new solutions to its customers. By bringing together the research and development in its milling, oils, protein, and sweetener product lines new products with increased functionality and efficiencies for its customers should be available.

(iii)	Source and availability of raw materials

Substantially all of the Company's raw materials are agricultural commodities. In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are driven by unpredictable factors such as weather, plantings, government (domestic and foreign) farm programs and policies, changes in global demand created by population growth and changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops.

(iv)	Patents, trademarks and licenses

The Company owns several valuable patents, trademarks and licenses, but does not consider any segment of its business dependent upon any single or group of patents, trademarks or licenses.

(v)	Extent to which business is seasonal

Since the Company is so widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in the manufacture, sale and distribution of its products and services. There is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of the Company's principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa beans and other grains. However, the actual physical movement of the millions of bushels of these crops through the Company's storage and processing facilities is reasonably constant throughout the year.

(vi)	Working capital items

Price variations and availability of raw agricultural commodities may cause fluctuations in the Company's inventories and short-term borrowings.

Item 1.	BUSINESS-Continued

(vii)	Dependence on single customer

No material part of the Company's business in any segment is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.

(viii)	Amount of backlog

Because of the nature of the Company's business, the backlog of orders at year end is not a significant indication of the Company's activity for the current or upcoming year.

(ix)	Business subject to renegotiation

The Company has no business with the government subject to renegotiation.

(x)	Competitive conditions

Markets for the Company's products are highly price competitive and sensitive to product substitution. No single company competes with the Company in all of its markets. However, a number of large companies compete with the Company in one or more markets. Major competitors in one or more markets include, but are not limited to, Cargill, Inc., ConAgra, Inc., Corn Products International, Inc., Bunge, Ltd., Barry Callebaut A.G. and Tate & Lyle PLC.

(xi)	Research and development expenditures

Practically all of the Company's technical efforts and expenditures are concerned with food and feed ingredient products. Special efforts are being made to find improvements in food technology to alleviate protein malnutrition throughout the world, utilizing the three largest United States crops: corn, soybeans and wheat.

The need to successfully market new or improved food and feed ingredients developed in the Company's research laboratories led to the concept of technical support. The Company is staffed with technical representatives who work closely with customers and potential customers on the development of food and feed products which incorporate Company-produced ingredients. These technical representatives are an adjunct to both the research and sales functions.

The Company maintains a research laboratory in Decatur, Illinois where product and process development activities are conducted. To develop new bioproducts and to improve existing bioproducts, new cultures are developed using classical mutation and genetic engineering. Protein and vegetable oil research is conducted at facilities in Decatur where bakery, meat and dairy pilot plants support application research. Research to support sales and development for bakery products is done at a laboratory in Olathe, Kansas. Research to support sales and development for cocoa and chocolate products is done in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the Netherlands. Research and technical support for industrial and food wheat starch applications is conducted in a Montreal, Canada research center. The Company maintains research centers in Quincy, Illinois and Decatur, Indiana that conduct swine and cattle feeding trials to test new formula feed products and to develop improved feeding efficiencies.

The amounts spent during the three years ended June 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000 for such technical efforts were approximately $26.1, $23.8 and $23.4 million, respectively.

Item 1.	BUSINESS-Continued

(xii)	Material effects of capital expenditures for environmental protection

During 2002, $17.6 million was spent for equipment, facilities and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.

There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with federal, state and local laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.

The Company expects expenditures for environmental facilities and programs will continue at approximately the present rate with no unusual amounts anticipated for the next two years.

(xiii)	Number of employees

The number of persons employed by the Company was 24,746 at June 30, 2002.

(d)	Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales

The Company's foreign operations are principally in developed countries and do not entail any undue or unusual business risks. Geographic financial information is set forth in "Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of the annual shareholders' report for the year ended June 30, 2002 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 3.	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

In 1993, the State of Illinois Environmental Protection Agency ("Illinois EPA") brought administrative enforcement proceedings arising out of the Company's alleged failure to obtain proper permits for certain pollution control equipment at one of the Company's processing facilities in Illinois. In 1998, the Illinois EPA filed an administrative enforcement proceeding arising out of certain alleged permit exceedances relating to the same facility. Also, in 1998 the Company voluntarily reported to the Illinois EPA certain other permit exceedances related to other processes at that same facility, and in 1999 Illinois EPA issued a Notice of Violation relating to those exceedances. In 2000, the Company voluntarily disclosed certain other permit exceedances at the same facility. In 1998, the State of Illinois filed a civil administrative action against the Company alleging violations of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, and regulations promulgated thereunder, arising from a one-time rele
ase of denatured ethanol at one of the Company's Illinois distribution facilities. The Company is in discussions with the Illinois EPA to settle all of the pending matters with the State. In January 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("U.S. EPA") issued a Notice of Violation to the Company for another Illinois facility regarding alleged emissions violations and the failure to obtain proper permits for various equipment at that facility. That matter has been referred to the Department of Justice ("DOJ"), and the Company has met with the U.S. EPA and DOJ regarding settlement of that matter. In management's opinion, the settlement of these proceedings, all seeking compliance with applicable environmental permits and regulations, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

The Company is involved in approximately 25 administrative and judicial proceedings in which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") under the federal Superfund law and its state analogs for the study and clean-up of sites contaminated by material discharged into the environment. In all of these matters, there are numerous PRPs. Due to various factors such as the required level of remediation and participation in the clean-up effort by others, the Company's future clean-up costs at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated. In management's opinion, these proceedings will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

LITIGATION REGARDING ALLEGED ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES

The Company is currently a defendant in various lawsuits related to alleged anticompetitive practices by the Company as described in more detail below. The Company intends to vigorously defend these actions unless they can be settled on terms deemed acceptable to the parties.

GOVERNMENTAL MATTERS

Federal grand juries in the Northern Districts of Illinois, California and Georgia, under the direction of the DOJ, have been investigating possible violations by the Company and others with respect to the sale of lysine, citric acid and high fructose corn syrup, respectively. In connection with an agreement with the DOJ in fiscal 1997, the Company paid the United States fines of $100 million. This agreement constituted a global resolution of all matters between the DOJ and the Company and brought to a close all DOJ investigations of the Company. The federal grand juries in the Northern Districts of Illinois (lysine) and Georgia (high fructose corn syrup) have been closed.

The Company has received notice that certain foreign governmental entities were commencing investigations to determine whether anticompetitive practices occurred in their jurisdictions. Except for the investigations being conducted by the Commission of the European Communities and the Brazilian Department of Protection and Economic Defense as described

Item 3.	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS-Continued

below, all such matters have been resolved as previously reported. In June 1997, the Company and several of its European subsidiaries were notified that the Commission of the European Communities had initiated an investigation as to possible anticompetitive practices in the amino acid markets, in particular the lysine market, in the European Union. On October 29, 1998, the Commission of the European Communities initiated formal proceedings against the Company and others and adopted a Statement of Objections. The reply of the Company was filed on February 1, 1999 and the hearing was held on March 1, 1999. On August 8, 1999, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a supplementary Statement of Objections expanding the period of involvement as to certain other companies. On June 7, 2000, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a decision imposing a fine against the Company in the amount of EUR 47.3 million. The Company has appealed this decision. In September 1997
, the Company received a request for information from the Commission of the European Communities with respect to an investigation being conducted by that Commission into the possible existence of certain agreements and/or concerted practices in the citric acid market in the European Union. On March 28, 2000, the Commission of European Communities initiated formal proceedings against the Company and others and adopted a Statement of Objections. The reply of the Company was filed on June 9, 2000. On December 17, 2001, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a decision imposing a fine against the Company in the amount of EUR 39.69 million. The Company has appealed this decision. In November 1998, a European subsidiary of the Company received a request for information from the Commission of the European Communities with respect to an investigation being conducted by that Commission into the possible existence of certain agreements and/or concerted practices in the sodium gluconate market in the Europe
an Union. On May 17, 2000, the Commission of European Communities initiated formal proceedings against the Company and others and adopted a Statement of Objections. The reply of Company was filed on September 1, 2000. On October 2, 2001, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a decision imposing a fine against the Company in the amount of EUR 10.3 million. The Company has appealed this decision. On May 8, 2000, a Brazilian subsidiary of the Company was notified of the commencement of an administrative proceeding by the Department of Protection and Economic Defense relative to possible anticompetitive practices in the lysine market in Brazil. On July 3, 2000, the Brazilian subsidiary of the Company filed a Statement of Defense in this proceeding.

The ultimate outcome of the proceedings of the Commission of the European Communities and the ultimate outcome and materiality of the proceedings of the Brazilian Department of Protection and Economic Defense cannot presently be determined. The Company may become the subject of similar antitrust investigations conducted by the applicable regulatory authorities of other countries.

HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP ACTIONS

The Company, along with other companies, has been named as a defendant in thirty-one antitrust suits involving the sale of high fructose corn syrup in the United States. Thirty of these actions have been brought as putative class actions.

FEDERAL ACTIONS. Twenty-two of these putative class actions allege violations of federal antitrust laws, including allegations that the defendants agreed to fix, stabilize and maintain at artificially high levels the prices of high fructose corn syrup, and seek injunctions against continued alleged illegal conduct, treble damages of an unspecified amount, attorneys' fees and costs, and other unspecified relief. The putative classes in these cases comprise certain direct purchasers of high fructose corn syrup during certain periods in the 1990s. These twenty-two actions have been transferred to the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois and consolidated under the caption In Re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 1087 and Master File No. 95-1477. On April 3, 2001, the Company and

On August 11, 2000, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On September 15, 2000, defendants moved to dismiss or in the alternative to strike plaintiffs' amended complaint. On June 19, 2001, the Court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' claim for restraint of trade in interstate commerce and granted defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim. The Court denied defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' restraint of trade in intrastate commerce claim. However, on July 3, 2001, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this claim. On July 18, 2001, plaintiffs moved to amend, alter or vacate the Court's dismissal of the unjust enrichment
 claim. On July 24, 2001, plaintiffs noticed an appeal of that part of the Court's order granting defendants' summary judgment motion. On October 9, 2001, the Court denied plaintiffs' motion to amend, alter or vacate the Court's dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim.
