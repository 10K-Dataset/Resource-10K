BUSINESS

Company
        Overview

Archer
        Daniels Midland Company (the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in 1923,
        successor to the Daniels Linseed Co. founded in 1902.  The Company is
        a world leader in BioEnergy and has a premier position in the agricultural
        processing value chain.  The Company is one of the world’s largest
        processors of oilseeds, corn, wheat, and cocoa and is a leading manufacturer
        of
        biodiesel, ethanol, soybean oil and meal, corn sweeteners, flour, and other
        value-added food and feed ingredients.  The Company also has an
        extensive grain elevator and transportation network to buy, store, clean,
        and
        transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo,
        oats,
        and barley.

During
        the
        last five years, the Company has experienced significant growth, spending
        approximately $4.8 billion for construction of new plants, expansions of
        existing plants, and the acquisitions of plants and transportation
        equipment.  The Company is constructing two dry corn milling plants
        which will increase the Company’s annual ethanol production capacity by 550
        million gallons to 1.7 billion gallons.  In addition, the Company has
        recently completed construction of, or is currently constructing, a polyhydroxy
        alkanoate (PHA) natural plastics production facility, a propylene/ethylene
        glycol production facility, United States and foreign cocoa processing
        facilities, and United States and foreign biodiesel production
        facilities.  Construction of these plants is expected to be completed
        during the next two fiscal years.  The Company expects to spend
        approximately $3.0 billion to construct these facilities and other approved
        capital projects over the next four years.  There have been no
        significant dispositions during the last five years.

Segment
        Descriptions

The
        Company’s operations are classified into three reportable business segments:
        Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing, and Agricultural Services.  Each
        of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services
        offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are aggregated and
        classified as Other.  Financial information with respect to the
        Company’s reportable business segments is set forth in “Note 14 of Notes to
        Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 herein, “Financial
        Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Oilseeds
        Processing

The
        Company is engaged in processing oilseeds such as soybeans, cottonseed,
        sunflower seeds, canola, peanuts, and flaxseed into vegetable oils and meals
        principally for the food and feed industries.  Crude vegetable oil is
        sold “as is” or is further processed by refining, bleaching, and deodorizing
        into salad oils.  Salad oils can be further processed by hydrogenating
        and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food
        products.  Partially refined oil is sold for use in chemicals, paints
        and other industrial products.  Refined oil can be further processed
        for use in the production of biodiesel.  Oilseed meals are primary
        ingredients used in the manufacture of commercial livestock and poultry
        feeds.  Cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the
        pharmaceutical industry.  Cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and
        sold to the chemical, paper, and filter markets.

Golden
        Peanut Company LLC, a joint venture between the Company and Alimenta (U.S.A.),
        Inc., is a major supplier of peanuts to both the domestic and export
        markets.  The Company has a 50% ownership interest in this joint
        venture.

The
        Company has an ownership interest in Wilmar International Limited, a Singapore
        publicly listed company.  Wilmar International Limited is the largest
        agricultural processing business in Asia and operates palm plantations; soybean,
        rapeseed, cottonseed, sunflower seed, peanut, palm kernel, and sesame seed
        crushing facilities and related vegetable oil refineries and packaging
        facilities; an oleochemical plant that produces fatty acids, glycerin, and
        soap
        noodles; a soy protein plant; wheat flour mills; rice mills; feed mills;
        fertilizer operations; and related silos and storage
        facilities.



Corn
        Processing

The
        Company is engaged in wet milling and dry milling corn
        operations.  Products produced for use in the food and beverage
        industry include syrup, starch, glucose, dextrose, and
        sweeteners.  Dextrose is also produced for use by the Company as a
        feedstock for its bioproducts operations.  Corn gluten feed and meal
        as well as distillers grains are produced for use as feed
        ingredients.  Corn germ, a by-product of the wet milling process, is
        further processed as an oilseed into vegetable oil and meal.

By
        fermentation of dextrose, the Company produces alcohol, amino acids, and
        other
        specialty food and feed ingredients.  Ethyl alcohol is produced to
        beverage grade or for industrial use as ethanol.  In gasoline, ethanol
        increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate.  Amino
        acids, such as lysine and threonine, are vital compounds used in swine feeds
        to
        produce leaner animals and in poultry feeds to enhance the speed and efficiency
        of poultry production.  The Company also produces, by fermentation,
        astaxanthin, a product used in aquaculture to enhance flesh
        coloration.  The Company produces citric and lactic acids, lactates,
        sorbitol and xanthan gum which are used in various food and industrial
        products.

        marketing, sale, and distribution to the end consumer.

The
        Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest
        primarily in emerging markets.

Methods
        of Distribution

Since
        the
        Company’s customers are principally other manufacturers and processors, the
        Company’s products are distributed mainly in bulk from processing plants or
        storage facilities directly to the customers’ facilities.  The Company
        has developed a comprehensive transportation system utilizing trucks, railcars,
        river barges, and ocean-going vessels to efficiently move both commodities
        and
        processed products virtually anywhere in the world.  The Company owns
        or leases large numbers of the trucks, trailers, railroad tank and hopper
        cars,
        river barges, and towboats used in this transportation system.



Status
        of New Products

The
        Company continues to expand its business in line with the Company’s strategy to
        be a world leader in BioEnergy whilst maintaining its premier position in
        the
        agricultural processing value chain through the development of new
        products.

The
        Company’s researchers have developed a number of custom low trans fats and oils
        for bakery and quick-service restaurants that utilize the Company’s Novalipid
        portfolio of low trans fats and oils.  These products meet the growing
        needs of food service customers driven by legislated municipal bans on the
        use
        of fats and oils that contain trans fats.

Our
        Aspire
        business model continues to be developed to leverage the Company’s finished food
        product development capabilities.  Under this program, ADM works with
        customers to supply finished food products such as nutrition bars, beverages
        and
        other items in a final packaged form ready for retail
        distribution.  The development of the prototypes is done by research
        and development staff and the manufacturing is accomplished through a network
        of
        co-manufacturers.  This program helps customers introduce more new
        trait-enhanced products more quickly than they would otherwise be able to
        accomplish.

The
        Company’s cooked, dried edible bean products are finding a number of new
        applications due to the increased interest among our customers in improving
        nutrition, especially in the area of foods targeted for
        children.  These edible bean powders are being used in a wide range of
        convenient foods.

The
        Company’s alliance with Metabolix is proceeding on
        schedule.  Semi-works production of PHA, a biodegradable plastic, is
        underway for market development, and construction of the Company’s 50,000 ton
        per year commercial manufacturing facility is on schedule for startup in
        December 2008.

The
        Company is proceeding with construction of a commercial propylene glycol
        (PG)
        facility in Decatur, Illinois.  Value-added derivatives of PG are
        being pursued by research and development staff.

Source
        and Availability of Raw Materials

Substantially
        all of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities.  In
        any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject
        to
        unpredictable factors such as weather, plantings, government (domestic and
        foreign) farm programs and policies, changes in global demand created by
        population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production
        of
        similar and competitive crops.  The substantial majority of the
        Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of grain elevators and
        wholesale merchants, principally in North America, South America, and Europe,
        pursuant to short-term agreements (less than one year) or on a spot
        basis.  The Company does not grow crops and a relatively small
        proportion of the Company’s raw materials are purchased directly from
        growers.  The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower,
        elevator, or merchant or group of growers, elevators, or merchants as a source
        for its raw materials.

Patents,
        Trademarks, and Licenses

The
        Company owns several valuable patents, trademarks, and licenses but does
        not
        consider any segment of its business dependent upon any single or group of
        patents, trademarks or licenses.



Seasonality,
        Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers

Since
        the
        Company is so widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are
        no
        material seasonal fluctuations in the manufacture, sale, and distribution
        of its
        products and services.  There is a degree of seasonality in the
        growing season and procurement of the Company’s principal raw materials:
        oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa beans, and other grains.  However, the
        actual physical movement of the millions of bushels of these crops through
        the
        Company’s storage and processing facilities is reasonably constant throughout
        the year.

Price
        variations and availability of raw agricultural commodities may cause
        fluctuations in the Company’s receivables, inventories, and short-term
        borrowings.  No material part of the Company’s business in any segment
        is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.

Competition

The
        Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based
        principally on price, quality, products and alternative products, some of
        which
        are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the
        Company.  Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses,
        the Company, on an ongoing basis,   focuses on managing unit
        costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity
        enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset
        portfolio.

Research
        and Development Expenditures

The
        Company’s research and development expenditures are focused on developing
        BioEnergy, food, feed, and industrial products from renewable, agricultural
        crops.  The Company uses technical services representatives to
        interact with customers to understand the customers’ product
        needs.  These technical service representatives then interact with
        researchers who are familiar with the Company’s wide range of food, feed, fuel,
        and industrial products as well as applications technology.  These
        individuals form quick-acting teams to develop solutions to customer
        needs.

The
        Company is completing the two projects currently funded by the United States
        Department of Energy.  The projects studied ways of converting corn
        fiber into either biofuels or animal feed.  The results are being used
        to evaluate the commercial feasibility.

The
        Company was recently awarded additional funding from the Department of
        Energy to develop yeasts capable of fermenting 5-carbon sugars, which is
        a key
        technology for producing ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass.  The
        Company is partnered with Purdue University on this project.

The
        Company’s biodiesel research is focused on cost, product quality, and alternate
        feed stocks.  Several new technologies have been developed to minimize
        the chemical input costs for biodiesel production while simultaneously reducing
        waste streams and improving yield.

A
        joint
        research project with Argonne National Laboratory is focused on the development
        of a separative bioreactor which utilizes the principles of
        electrodeionization.  The new approach allows the production of
        chemicals from biomass feedstocks without the usual production of salt
        byproducts.  This technology is being tested at pilot scale to
        quantify cost and performance.

The
        Company has also acquired a semi-works/toll-processing facility in Decatur,
        Illinois to be able to produce small scale commercial quantities of new
        bio-based industrial chemicals.



The
        Company maintains a research laboratory in Decatur, Illinois, where product
        and
        process development activities are conducted.  To develop new
        bioproducts and to improve existing bioproducts, new cultures are developed
        using classical mutation and genetic engineering.  Protein and

RISK
                  FACTORS

The
        availability and price of the agricultural commodities and agricultural
        commodity products the Company produces and merchandises can be affected
        by
        weather, disease, government programs, and various other factors beyond the
        Company’s control and could adversely affect the Company’s operating
        results.

The
        availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide
        fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather, plantings, government
        (domestic and foreign) farm programs and policies, changes in global demand
        resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and
        global
        production of similar and competitive crops.  These factors have
        historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodities industry and,
        consequently, in the Company’s operating results.  Reduced supply of
        agricultural commodities due to weather-related factors or other reasons
        could
        adversely affect the Company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw
        materials used in the Company’s agricultural processing
        operations.  Reduced supplies of agricultural commodities could also
        limit the Company’s ability to procure, transport, store, process, and
        merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner which could
        adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  In addition, the
        availability and price of agricultural commodities can be affected by other
        factors, such as plant disease, which can result in crop failures and reduced
        harvests.

Also,
        with
        respect to prices, to the extent production capacity is added within the
        agricultural processing industry, the disruption to the balance of supply
        and
        demand may result in downward pressure on the relevant product prices, thereby
        adversely affecting revenues and operating results.

Fluctuations
        in energy prices could adversely affect the Company’s operating
        results.

The
        Company’s operating costs and selling prices of certain finished products are
        sensitive to changes in energy prices.  The Company’s processing
        plants are powered principally by electricity, natural gas, and
        coal.  The Company’s transportation operations are dependent upon
        diesel fuel and other petroleum products.  Significant increases in
        the cost of these items could adversely affect the Company’s production costs
        and operating results.

The
        Company has certain finished products, such as ethanol and biodiesel, which
        are
        closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum
        products.  Therefore, the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel
        relate to the selling prices of unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel.  A
        significant decrease in the price of unleaded gasoline or diesel fuel could
        result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the Company’s ethanol
        and biodiesel and could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating
        results.

The
        Company is subject to economic downturns, political instability and other
        risks
        of doing business globally which could adversely affect the Company’s operating
        results.

The
        Company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many
        countries and geographic areas. The Company’s operations are principally in
        developed countries in the United States, Europe, and South America but the
        Company also operates in, or plans to expand or develop its business in,
        emerging market areas such as Asia. Both developed and emerging market areas
        are
        subject to economic downturns and emerging market areas could be subject
        to more
        volatile economic, political and market conditions. Such economic downturns
        and
        volatile conditions may have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to
        execute its business strategies and on its operating results.

Item
                  1A.

RISK
                  FACTORS (Continued)

The
        Company’s operating results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and
        fiscal policies, laws and regulations, and other activities of United States
        and foreign, agencies, and similar organizations.  These
        conditions include but are not limited to changes in a country’s or region’s
        economic or political conditions, trade regulations affecting production,
        pricing and marketing of products, local labor conditions and regulations,
        reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory
        or
        legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency
        exchange fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, and other trade
        barriers.  International risks and uncertainties, including changing
        social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities,
        and
        war, could limit the Company’s ability to transact business in these markets and
        could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.

Government
        policies and regulations, in general, and specifically affecting the
        agricultural sector and related industries, could adversely affect the
        Company’s operating results.

Agricultural
        production and trade flows are subject to government policies and regulations.
        Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes,
        tariffs, duties, subsidies, and import and export restrictions on agricultural
        commodities and commodity products, can influence the planting of certain
        crops,
        the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed
        commodity products are traded, the volume and types of imports and exports,
        the
        availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials, and industry
        profitability.  In addition, international trade disputes can adversely
        affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade
        between countries or regions. Future government policies may adversely affect
        the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Company’s products, restrict the
        Company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets, and could
        negatively impact revenues and operating results.

The
        Company is subject to food and feed
        industry risks which could adversely affect the Company’s operating
        results.

The
        Company is subject to food industry risks which include, but are not limited
        to,
        food spoilage or food contamination, shifting consumer preferences, federal,
        state, and local food processing regulations, and customer product liability
        claims.  The liability which could result from these risks may not
        always be covered or could exceed liability insurance related to product
        liability and food safety matters maintained by the Company.  The
        occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the
        Company’s revenues and operating results.

Certain
        of
        the Company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as
        ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.  The Company is subject to
        risks associated with the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry,
        including, but not limited to, mad-cow disease and avian
        influenza.  The outbreak of disease could adversely affect demand for
        the Company’s products used as ingredients in livestock and poultry
        feed.  A decrease in demand for these products could adversely affect
        the Company’s revenues and operating results.

Item
                  1A.

RISK
                  FACTORS (Continued)

The
        Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations globally which could
        adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The
        Company is required to comply with the numerous and broad reaching laws and
        regulations administered by United States federal, state, local, and foreign
        governmental agencies relating to, but not limited to, the sourcing,
        transporting, storing, and processing of agricultural raw materials as well
        as
        the transporting, storing and distributing of related agricultural products
        including commercial activities conducted by Company employees and third
        parties globally.  Any failure to comply with applicable laws and
        regulations could subject the Company to administrative penalties and injunctive
        relief, civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of its
        products.

The
        production of the Company’s products requires the use of materials which can
        create emissions of certain regulated substances.  Although the
        Company has programs in place throughout the organization globally to guard
        against non-compliance, failure to comply with these regulations can have
        serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties as well
        as a
        negative impact on the Company’s reputation.

In
        addition, changes to regulations may require the Company to modify existing
        processing facilities and/or processes which could significantly increase
        operating costs and negatively impact operating results.

The
        Company is exposed to potential business disruption, including but not limited
        to transportation services, and other serious adverse impacts resulting from
        acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters and severe weather conditions,
        and
        accidents which could adversely affect the Company’s operating
        results.

The
        assets
        and operations of the Company are subject to damage and disruption from various
        events which include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism or war, natural
        disasters and severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, and
        fires.

The
        potential effects of the conditions cited above include, but are not limited
        to,
        extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries,
        and damage to the environment.  The Company’s operations also rely on
        dependable and efficient transportation services.  A disruption in
        transportation services could result in supply problems at the Company’s
        processing plants and impair the Company’s ability to deliver processed products
        to its customers in a timely manner.

The
                  Company’s operations are such that most products are efficiently processed
                  near the source of raw materials.  Consequently, the Company has
                  many plants strategically located in grain producing areas.  The
                  annual volume of commodities processed will vary depending upon
                  availability of raw materials and demand for finished
                  products.

LEGAL
                PROCEEDINGS

Environmental
      Matters

The
      Company is involved in approximately twenty administrative and judicial
      proceedings in which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party
      (PRP) under the federal Superfund law and its state analogs for the study and
      cleanup of sites contaminated by material discharged into the
      environment.  In all of these matters there are numerous
      PRPs.  Due to various factors, such as the required level of
      remediation and participation in the cleanup effort by others, the Company’s
      future cleanup costs at these sites cannot be reasonably
      estimated.  In management’s opinion, these proceedings will not,
      either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse affect on
      the
      Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

MANAGEMENT’S
                  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
                  OPERATIONS

Company
        Overview

The
        Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing,
        and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  The
        Company’s operations are classified into three reportable business
        segments:  Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing, and Agricultural
        Services.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature
        of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations
        are aggregated and classified as Other.

The
        Oilseeds Processing segment includes activities related to processing oilseeds
        such as soybeans, cottonseed, sunflower seeds, canola, peanuts, and flaxseed
        into vegetable oils and meals principally for the food and feed
        industries.  In addition, oilseeds may be resold into the marketplace
        as a raw material for other processors.  Crude vegetable oil is sold
        "as is" or is further processed by refining, bleaching, and deodorizing into
        salad oils.  Salad oils can be further processed by hydrogenating
        and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food
        products.  Partially refined oil is sold for use in chemicals, paints,
        and other industrial products.  Refined oil can be further processed
        for use in the production of biodiesel.  Oilseed meals are primary
        ingredients used in the manufacture of commercial livestock and poultry
        feeds.  Oilseeds Processing also includes activities related to the
        Company’s interest in Wilmar International Limited, the largest agricultural
        processing business in Asia.

The
        Corn
        Processing segment includes activities related to the production of sweeteners,
        starches, dextrose, and syrups for the food and beverage industry as well
        as
        activities related to the production, by fermentation, of bioproducts such
        as
        alcohol, amino acids, and other specialty food and feed
        ingredients.

The
        Agricultural Services segment utilizes the Company’s extensive grain elevator
        and transportation network to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural
        commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, and barley, and resells
        these commodities primarily as feed ingredients and as raw materials for
        the
        agricultural processing industry.  Agricultural Services’ grain
        sourcing and transportation network provides reliable and efficient services
        to
        the Company’s agricultural processing operations.  Also included in
        Agricultural Services are the activities of A.C. Toepfer International, a
        global
        merchandiser of agricultural commodities and processed products.

Other
        includes the Company’s remaining operations, consisting principally of food,
        feed, and industrial businesses and financial activities.  Food, feed,
        and industrial includes: Wheat Processing, with activities related to the
        production of wheat flour; Cocoa Processing, with activities related to the
        production of chocolate and cocoa products; the production of natural health
        and
        nutrition products; and the production of other food, feed, and industrial
        products.  Financial activities include banking, captive insurance,
        private equity fund investments, and futures commission merchant
        activities.

Operating
        Performance Indicators

The
        Company’s Oilseeds Processing, Agricultural Services, and Wheat Processing
        operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where
        changes
        in segment selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the
        commodity-based agricultural raw materials.  Therefore, changes in
        agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both net sales
        and cost of products sold and minimal impact on the gross profit of underlying
        transactions. As a result, changes in net sales amounts of these business
        segments do not necessarily correspond to the changes in gross profit realized
        by these businesses.

The
        Company’s Corn Processing operations and certain other food and feed processing
        operations also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from
        agricultural commodities) as raw materials.  In these operations,
        agricultural commodity price changes can result in significant fluctuations
        in
        cost of products sold, and such price changes cannot necessarily be passed
        directly through to the selling price of the finished products.  For
        products such as ethanol, selling prices bear no direct relationship to the
        raw
        material cost of the agricultural commodity from which it is
        produced.

MANAGEMENT’S
                  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                  (Continued)

The
        Company conducts its business in many countries.  For the majority of
        the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency
        is the functional currency.  Revenues and expenses denominated in
        foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average
        exchange rates for the applicable periods.  Fluctuations in the
        exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and British pound,
        as
        compared to the U.S. dollar will result in corresponding fluctuations in
        the
        relative U.S. dollar value of the Company’s revenues and
        expenses.  The impact of these currency exchange rate changes, where
        significant, is discussed below.

The
        Company measures the performance of its business segments using key operating
        statistics such as segment operating profit and return on fixed capital
        investment, and return on net assets.  The Company’s operating results
        can vary significantly due to changes in unpredictable factors such as
        fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, global
        government farm programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting
        from
        population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production
        of
        similar and competitive crops.  Due to these unpredictable factors,
        the Company does not provide forward-looking information in “Management’s
        Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations.”

        Compared to 2006

As
        an
        agricultural-based commodity business, the Company is subject to a variety
        of
        market factors which affect the Company’s operating results.  Strong
        biodiesel demand in Europe continued to create increased vegetable oil demand
        and positively impacted rapeseed crushing margins in Europe.  Abundant
        oilseed supplies, improved vegetable oil values, and strong protein meal
        demand
        have positively impacted oilseed crushing margins in North
        America.  Increased ethanol contracted selling prices, continuing
        strong ethanol demand, and solid demand for sweetener and starch products
        improved corn processing results.  These increases in corn processing
        results were partially offset by higher net corn costs.  Global grain
        merchandising opportunities resulting from regional production imbalances
        also
        improved operating results.  North American river transportation
        operations were favorably impacted by strong demand for river transportation
        services which increased barge freight rates.  Increasing commodity
        price levels negatively affected LIFO inventory valuations partially offsetting
        the improvements in operating results.

Net
        earnings increased principally due to improved operating results in all of
        the
        Company’s operating segments.  Earnings before income taxes for 2007
        include a gain of $440 million related to the exchange of the Company’s
        interests in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International
        Limited (the Wilmar Gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales
        of
        the Company’s equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding
        Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Company’s interest in
        Agricore United and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Company’s Arkady
        food ingredient business.  Earnings before income taxes for 2007 also
        include charges of $206 million from the effect of changing commodity prices
        on
        LIFO inventory valuations, $46 million related to the repurchase of $400
        million
        of the Company’s outstanding debentures, and $21 million related to abandonment
        and write-down of long-lived assets.  Net earnings for 2006 include a
        $36 million reduction in income tax expense related to the recognition of
        federal and state income tax credits and adjustments resulting from the
        reconciliation of filed tax returns to the previously estimated tax
        provision.  Earnings before income taxes for 2006 include charges of
        $15 million resulting from the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting
        Standards Board Interpretation Number 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset
        Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

(FIN
        47), $71 million related to abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets,
        $9
        million representing the Company’s share of a charge for abandonment and
        write-down of long-lived assets reported by an unconsolidated affiliate of
        the
        Company, and $22 million associated with the closure of a citric acid plant
        and
        exiting the European animal feed business.  Earnings before income
        taxes for 2006 also include credits of $12 million from the effect of changing
        commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, $17 million from the sale
        of
        long-lived assets, $46 million related to Brazilian transactional tax credits,
        and $40 million related to realized securities gains.

                  (Continued)

Analysis
        of Statements of Earnings

Net
        sales
        and other operating income increased 20% to $44.0 billion due primarily to
        increased selling prices of agricultural commodities, oilseed and corn
        processing products and, to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes of
        agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products.  In
        addition, net sales and other operating income increased $916 million, or
        3%,
        due to currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Net
        sales
        and other operating income by segment are as follows:

Oilseeds
        Processing sales increased 17% to $13.9 billion due principally to increased
        average selling prices of vegetable oil and increased sales volumes of vegetable
        oil and biodiesel.  Vegetable oil selling prices and volumes improved
        as the markets anticipate new demand from the developing United States biodiesel
        industry.  Biodiesel sales volumes increased due to additional
        production capacity.  Corn Processing sales increased 12% to $5.4
        billion principally due to increased sales of Bioproducts and, to a lesser
        extent, increased sales of Sweeteners and Starches.  Bioproducts sales
        increased primarily due to higher average selling prices of ethanol, partially
        offset by lower sales volumes.  Ethanol average selling prices
        increased principally due to higher gasoline prices.  Ethanol sales
        volumes decreased as 2006 sales volumes exceeded production due to the release
        of inventories built up in anticipation of refiners replacing MTBE with
        ethanol.  Sweeteners and Starches sales increased primarily due to
        higher average selling prices resulting from good demand for sweetener and
        starch products.  Agricultural Services sales increased 28% to $19.7
        billion principally due to increased agricultural commodity prices and increased
        sales volumes.  The increase in commodity prices is primarily due to
        higher average market prices of corn in North America which have increased
        60%
        from the prior year.  Increased sales volumes of global grain
        merchandising activities also contributed to the increase in Agricultural
        Services sales.  Other sales increased 11% to $4.9 billion primarily
        due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour products and, to a lesser
        extent, increased sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa
        products.

Cost
        of
        products sold increased 21% to $40.8 billion primarily due to higher average
        prices of agricultural commodities and increased sales
        volumes.  Manufacturing costs for 2007 and 2006 include a $21 million
        and $62 million charge, respectively, for abandonment and write-down of
        long-lived assets.  In addition, cost of products sold increased $874
        million, or 3%, due to currency exchange rate fluctuations.

MANAGEMENT’S
                  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                  (Continued)

Selling,
        general, and administrative expenses of $1.2 billion were comparable to 2006
        and
        include $25 million of currency exchange rate increases.  Excluding
        the impact of currency exchange rate increases, selling, general and
        administrative expenses decreased $23 million principally due to 2006 selling,
        general and administrative expenses including $20 million of severance costs
        associated with the closure of a citric acid plant.  During 2007 and
        2006, the Company issued option grants and restricted stock awards to officers
        and key employees pursuant to the Company’s Long-term Management Incentive
        Program.  Certain officers and key employees of the Company receiving
        option grants and restricted stock awards are eligible for
        retirement.  Compensation expense related to option grants and
        restricted stock awards issued to these retirement-eligible employees is
        recognized in earnings on the date of grant.  Selling, general, and
        administrative expense for 2007 and 2006 includes compensation expense related
        to option grants and restricted stock awards granted to retirement-eligible
        employees of $30 million and $31 million, respectively.

Other
        income increased $1.0 billion primarily due to the $440 million Wilmar Gain,
        a
        $357 million gain on the sale of the Company’s equity securities of Tyson Foods,
        Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $153 million gain on the sale
        of
        the Company’s interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain on the sale of
        the Company’s Arkady food ingredient business.  Other income also
        includes a $46 million charge related to the repurchase of $400 million of
        the
        Company’s outstanding debentures.  Excluding these items, other income
        increased $73 million primarily due to a $120 million increase in equity
        in
        earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, and a $53 million increase in investment
        income, partially offset by a $69 million increase in interest expense and
        a $27
        million reduction in gains on sales of long-lived assets.  The
        increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is primarily
        due to
        higher valuations of the Company’s private equity fund investments and improved
        operating results of the Company’s Asian oilseed crushing
        ventures.  Interest expense and investment income increased primarily
        due to increased average borrowing and investment levels.

                  (Continued)

Oilseeds
        Processing operating profits increased $518 million to $1.1 billion due to
        the
        $440 million Wilmar Gain and improved market conditions in all geographic
        regions.  North American processing results improved principally due
        to abundant oilseed supplies in the United States and good demand for vegetable
        oil and soybean meal.  Vegetable oil values improved as the markets
        anticipate new demand from the developing United States biodiesel
        industry.  North American processing results were also favorably
        impacted by lower plant operating costs resulting from improved capacity
        utilization.  Asian joint venture results improved due to improved
        palm processing operating results partially offset by decreased soy crushing
        operating results.  European processing results improved principally
        due to abundant oilseed supplies in Europe and strong demand for vegetable
        oil.  The strong demand for vegetable oil is the result of strong
        biodiesel demand.  These increases were partially offset by decreased
        biodiesel operating profits resulting from higher vegetable oil prices,
        increased market production capacity, and lower diesel fuel
        prices.  South American processing results declined principally due to
        last year’s $27 million credit for Brazilian transactional
        taxes.  Excluding the impact of last year’s credit for Brazilian
        transactional taxes, South American processing results improved principally
        due
        to increased fertilizer margins.  The improvement in fertilizer
        margins was primarily due to higher average sales prices due to improved
        fertilizer demand combined with stable raw material costs.  Operating
        profits for 2007 include a $5 million charge for abandonment and write-down
        of
        long-lived assets.  Operating profits for 2006 include a $14 million
        charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets and a $6 million
        charge related to the adoption of FIN 47.

Corn
        Processing operating profits increased $242 million to $1.1 billion principally
        due to higher average selling prices and lower energy costs, partially offset
        by
        lower ethanol sales volumes and higher net corn costs.  Net corn costs
        have increased approximately 60% during 2007 due to significant demand increases
        for corn resulting primarily from the increase in corn-derived ethanol industry
        capacity.  Agricultural commodity market concerns regarding the
        expected decline in the ending 2006 corn crop carryover has also contributed
        to
        the increase in corn costs.  Sweeteners and Starches operating profits
        increased $53 million due primarily to higher average sales prices and lower
        energy costs.  Sales prices have increased principally due to good
        demand for sweetener and starch products.  These increases were
        partially offset by increased net corn costs.  Sweeteners and Starches
        operating profits for 2006 include a $5 million charge related to the adoption
        of FIN 47.  Bioproducts operating profits increased $189 million
        primarily due to higher ethanol average selling prices and lower energy costs,
        partially offset by increased net corn costs and lower ethanol sales
        volumes.  Ethanol average sales prices increased principally due to
        strong demand from gasoline refiners and higher gasoline
        prices.  Ethanol sales volumes decreased as 2006 sales volumes
        exceeded production due to the release of inventories built up in anticipation
        of refiners replacing MTBE with ethanol.  Bioproducts operating
        results for 2007 include a $1 million charge for abandonment and write-down
        of
        long-lived assets.  Bioproducts operating results for 2006 include a
        $6 million charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets, a
        $2
        million charge related to the adoption of FIN 47, and $6 million of costs
        related to the closure of a citric acid plant.

Agricultural
        Services operating profits increased $241 million to $516 million principally
        due to a $153 million gain from the sale of the Company’s interest in Agricore
        United, a Canadian business which specialized in crop input, crop protection
        services, and grain marketing and merchandising.  Excluding the
        Agricore United gain, Agricultural Services operating profits increased $88
        million to $363 million principally due to improved global grain merchandising
        operating results and, to a lesser extent, improved transportation and North
        American origination operating results.  Global grain merchandising
        results improved as regional production imbalances allowed the Company to
        capitalize on merchandising opportunities.  North American river
        transportation operating results increased primarily due to increased barge
        freight rates created by strong demand for barge capacity.  North
        American origination operating results improved due to good export demand
        for
        agricultural commodities and higher ocean freight rates.  Agricultural
        Services operating profits for 2007 include a $12 million trade disruption
        insurance recovery related to Hurricane Katrina.

Other
        operating profits increased $99 million to $409 million.  Other –
Food, Feed, and Industrial operating profits increased $55 million and include
        a
        $53 million gain on the sale of the Company’s Arkady food ingredient business
        and a $15 million charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived
        assets.  Other – Food, Feed, and Industrial operating results for 2006
        include a $51 million charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived
        assets, a $2 million charge related to the adoption of FIN 47, a $9 million
        charge representing the Company’s share of a charge for abandonment and
        write-down of long-lived assets reported by an unconsolidated affiliate of
        the
        Company, a $17 million gain from the sale of long-lived assets, and a $16
        million charge related to exiting the European animal feed
        business.  Excluding the effect of these 2007 and 2006 items, Other –
Food, Feed, and Industrial operating profits declined $44 million due primarily
        to cocoa processing operating results declining from prior year levels and
        costs
        related to the start-up of the Company’s natural plastics production
        operations.  Cocoa processing operating results declined primarily due
        to increased industry production capacity which caused downward pressure
        on
        cocoa processing margins.  These increases were partially offset by
        improved operating results of the Company’s wheat flour processing and protein
        specialty operations.  Other – Financial operating profits increased
        $44 million principally due to increased valuations of the Company’s private
        equity fund investments and higher operating results of the Company’s futures
        commission merchant business, partially offset by lower operating results
        of the
        Company’s captive insurance operations.  The results of the Company’s
        captive insurance operations for 2007 include a $12 million charge related
        to a
        Hurricane Katrina trade disruption insurance settlement.

Corporate
        expense decreased $199 million to $7 million principally due to a $345 million
        increase in realized securities gains principally resulting from sales of
        the
        Company’s equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group,
        Inc. and a $103 million reduction in unallocated interest expense due
        principally to higher levels of invested funds and higher interest
        rates.  These decreases were partially offset by a $206 million
        charge, compared to a $12 million credit in the prior year, related to the
        effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations and a $46
        million charge related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Company’s
        outstanding debentures.

Income
        taxes increased due principally to higher pretax earnings and the absence
        of
        last year’s $36 million income tax credit related to the recognition of federal
        and state income tax credits and adjustments resulting from the reconciliation
        of filed tax returns to the previously estimated tax provision.  The
        Company’s effective tax rate during 2007 was 31.5% and, after excluding the
        effect of last year’s $36 million tax credit, was 31.2% for the prior
        year.  The increase in the Company’s effective tax rate is primarily
        due to changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings.

        Compared to 2005

As
        an
        agricultural-based commodity business, the Company is subject to a variety
        of
        market factors which affect the Company’s operating results.  Strong
        biodiesel demand in Europe continued to create increased vegetable oil demand
        and has positively impacted rapeseed crushing margins in
        Europe.  Abundant oilseed supplies and strong protein meal demand have
        positively impacted oilseed crushing margins in North America.  A good
        corn supply resulting in lower price levels for corn favorably impacted corn
        processing operations, while ethanol experienced good demand due to gasoline
        refiners replacing MTBE with ethanol.  Solid demand for sweetener and
        starch products has also improved corn processing results.  During the
        first half of 2006, hurricanes in the gulf coast region of the United States
        disrupted North American grain origination and agricultural commodity export
        operations, negatively impacting export sales volumes.  The gulf coast
        hurricanes also disrupted river transportation, resulting in increased barge
        demand and barge freight rates.

                  (Continued)

Net
        earnings increased principally due to improved operating results of Oilseeds
        Processing and Corn Processing.  In addition, net earnings also
        increased due to a $36 million reduction in income tax expense related to
        the
        recognition of federal and state income tax credits and adjustments resulting
        from the reconciliation of filed tax returns to the previously estimated
        tax
        provision.  Earnings before income taxes for 2006 include charges of
        $31 million resulting from the Company’s adoption of Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards (SFAS) Number 123(R),

Share Based Payment

, $15
        million resulting from the Company’s adoption of FIN 47, $71 million related to
        abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets, $9 million representing
        the
        Company’s share of a charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets
        reported by an unconsolidated affiliate of the Company, and $22 million
        associated with the closure of a citric acid plant and exiting the European
        animal feed business.  Earnings before income taxes for 2006 also
        include credits of $12 million from the effect of changing commodity prices
        on
        LIFO inventory valuations, $17 million from the sale of long-lived assets,
        $46
        million related to Brazilian transactional tax credits, and $40 million related
        to realized securities gains.  Earnings before income taxes for 2005
        included credits of $114 million from the effect of changing commodity prices
        on
        LIFO inventory valuations, $114 million of realized securities gain from
        the
        sale of Tate & Lyle PLC shares, and $45 million representing the Company’s
        equity share of the gain reported by the Company’s unconsolidated affiliate,
        Compagnie Industrielle et Financiere des Produits Amylaces SA (CIP), upon
        the
        sale of its interest in Tate & Lyle PLC (the CIP Gain).  Earnings
        before income taxes for 2005 also include a $42 million charge for abandonment
        and write-down of long-lived assets.

Analysis
        of Statements of Earnings

Net
        sales
        and other operating income increased 2% to $36.6 billion due primarily to
        higher
        average selling prices of agricultural commodities and increased sales volumes
        and selling prices of corn processing products, partially offset by decreased
        average selling prices of cocoa products and currency exchange rate decreases
        of
        $415 million.

                  (Continued)

Oilseeds
        Processing sales increased $64 million to $11.9 billion principally due to
        higher average selling prices of South American oilseed exports and of vegetable
        oil.  These increases were partially offset by lower average selling
        prices of protein meal.  Corn Processing sales increased 11% to $4.9
        billion due to sales increases in both Sweeteners and Starches and
        Bioproducts.  Sweeteners and Starches sales increased due to higher
        average selling prices and sales volumes.  Sales volumes and prices
        have increased primarily due to solid demand for sweetener and starch
        products.  Bioproducts sales increased primarily due to increased
        sales volumes and average selling prices of ethanol, partially offset by
        lower
        average selling prices of lysine.  The increases in ethanol sales
        volumes and sales prices were principally due to increased demand from gasoline
        refiners as refiners used ethanol to replace MTBE as a gasoline additive
        and to
        increased gasoline prices.  Agricultural Services sales increased 2%
        to $15.4 billion primarily due to increased commodity prices in North America
        and, to a lesser extent, increased barge freight rates as the gulf coast
        hurricanes reduced barge capacities and created strong demand for North American
        river transportation.  These increases were partially offset by
        decreased commodity sales volumes in North America.  The decreased
        sales volumes were primarily due to disruptions in North American grain
        origination and export activities caused by the hurricanes in the gulf coast
        region.  Other sales decreased 3% to $4.4 billion primarily due to
        decreased average selling prices of cocoa products and lower sales volumes
        of
        formula feed products.  These decreases were partially offset by
        increased average selling prices of wheat flour products due to higher commodity
        prices.

Cost
        of
        products sold increased $118 million to $33.6 billion due primarily to higher
        average prices of agricultural commodities and increased manufacturing costs,
        partially offset by currency exchange rate decreases of $389
        million.  Manufacturing costs increased $399 million primarily due to
        increased energy costs, an $86 million charge for abandonment and write-down
        of
        long-lived assets, and increased employee-related costs.

Selling,
        general, and administrative expenses increased $112 million to $1.2 billion
        principally due to increased employee-related costs, including a $31 million
        charge related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), $20 million of severance costs
        associated with the closure of a citric acid plant, and increased provisions
        for
        doubtful accounts.

Other
        income decreased $84 million due primarily to a $73 million decrease in realized
        securities gains, a $55 million decrease in equity in earnings of affiliates,
        and a $39 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $69
        million increase in investment income.  The decrease in realized
        securities gains is primarily due to the $114 million realized securities
        gain
        in 2005 from the sale of Tate & Lyle PLC shares, partially offset by $40
        million of realized securities gains during 2006.  The decrease in
        equity in earnings of affiliates is primarily due to the CIP Gain in 2005
        and
        lower valuations of the Company’s private equity fund investments in 2006,
        partially offset by improved earnings of the Company’s Asian oilseed crushing
        ventures.  Interest expense increased primarily due to higher average
        borrowing levels and interest rates.  Investment income increased
        primarily due to the reversal of $19 million of Brazilian transactional taxes
        previously assessed on investment income upon positive resolution in the
        Brazilian Supreme Court, higher levels of invested funds, and higher interest
        rates.

Operating
        profit by segment is as follows:

Oilseeds
        Processing operating profits increased $254 million to $599 million primarily
        due to improved market conditions in all geographic regions.  European
        processing results improved principally due to strong demand for biodiesel
        and
        abundant rapeseed supplies in Europe.  This strong demand for
        biodiesel in Europe increased European vegetable oil demand and resulted
        in
        improved oilseeds processing results.  Abundant rapeseed supplies in
        Europe resulted in lower rapeseed price levels.  North American
        processing results improved principally due to abundant oilseed supplies
        in the
        United States and good demand for soybean meal.  Vegetable oil values
        were solid as the markets anticipate new demand from the developing United
        States biodiesel industry.  South American operating results increased
        primarily due to improved origination activities and a $27 million credit
        for
        Brazilian transactional taxes.  Operating results in Asia increased
        due to improved soy crushing margins and improved palm
        operations.  Operating profits include a $14 million charge for
        abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets and a $6 million charge related
        to the adoption of FIN 47.  Operating profits for 2005 include a
        charge of $13 million for abandonment and write-down of long-lived
        assets.

Corn
        Processing operating profits increased $347 million to $877 million primarily
        due to higher average selling prices, increased sales volumes, and lower
        net
        corn costs, partially offset by increased energy costs.  Sweeteners
        and Starches operating profits increased $160 million due primarily to decreased
        net corn costs and higher average sales prices and sales
        volumes.  Sales volumes and prices have increased primarily due to
        good demand for sweetener and starch products.  These increases were
        partially offset by increased energy costs.  Sweeteners and Starches
        operating profits include a $5 million charge related to the adoption of
        FIN
        47.  Bioproducts operating profits increased $187 million primarily
        due to higher ethanol sales volumes and average selling prices and decreased
        net
        corn costs, partially offset by increased energy costs and lower lysine average
        selling prices.  The increases in ethanol sales volumes and average
        sales prices were principally due to increased demand from gasoline refiners
        as
        refiners used ethanol to replace MTBE as a gasoline additive and from increased
        gasoline prices.  Bioproducts operating profits include a $6 million
        charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets, a $2 million
        charge
        related to the adoption of FIN 47, and $6 million of costs related to the
        closure of a citric acid plant.  Bioproducts operating profits for
        2005 include a $16 million charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived
        assets.

MANAGEMENT'S
                  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                  (Continued)

Agricultural
        Services operating profits increased $13 million to $275 million as improved
        results from transportation operations were partially offset by a decline
        in
        global grain merchandising and North American origination operating
        results.  North American river transportation operating results
        increased primarily due to increased barge freight rates created by strong
        demand for barge capacity.  This increase was partially offset by
        increased fuel costs.  The gulf coast hurricanes negatively impacted
        North American origination and export activities during the first half of
        2006.

Other
        operating profits decreased $104 million to $310 million.  Other –
Food, Feed, and Industrial operating results decreased $104 million due
        primarily to a $51 million charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived
        assets, a $2 million charge related to the adoption of FIN 47, and a $9 million
        charge representing the Company’s share of a charge for abandonment and
        write-down of long-lived assets reported by an unconsolidated affiliate of
        the
        Company.  In addition, cocoa processing, natural health and nutrition,
        and formula feed operating results declined from prior year
        levels.  Cocoa processing operating results declined primarily due to
        increased industry capacity which caused downward pressure on cocoa finished
        product prices.  Formula feed operating results declined due to costs
        associated with exiting the European animal feed business.  Other –
Food, Feed, and Industrial operating profits include a $17 million gain from
        the
        sale of long-lived assets.  Other – Food, Feed, and Industrial
        operating results for 2005 include a $13 million charge for abandonment and
        write-down of long-lived assets.  Other – Financial operating profits
        are comparable to prior year levels as improvements in the Company’s captive
        insurance operations and futures commission merchant business offset lower
        valuations of the Company’s private equity fund investments.

Corporate
        decreased $171 million due primarily to a $102 million decrease in income
        from
        the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, the
        $114
        million realized securities gain in 2005 from the sale of Tate & Lyle PLC
        shares, the CIP Gain in 2005, and a $22 million charge in 2006 upon the adoption
        of SFAS 123(R), partially offset by the aforementioned $19 million reversal
        of
        Brazilian transactional taxes and a $97 million reduction in unallocated
        interest expense.  The reduction in unallocated interest expense is
        due principally to higher levels of invested funds and higher interest
        rates.

Income
        taxes increased due principally to higher pretax earnings.  This
        increase was partially offset by a $36 million reduction in income tax expense
        related to the recognition of federal and state income tax credits and
        adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of filed tax returns to the
        previously estimated tax provision.  The Company’s effective tax rate
        for 2006 was 29.3% as compared to 31.1% for 2005.  Excluding the
        effect of the $36 million tax credit, the Company’s effective tax rate was 31.2%
        for 2006 and, after excluding the effect of the CIP Gain, was 32.1% for
        2005.  No tax was provided on the CIP Gain in 2005, as CIP is a
        corporate joint venture of the Company and the proceeds from the sale are
        permanently reinvested.  Excluding the effect of the $36 million tax
        credit in 2006 and the CIP Gain in 2005, the decrease in the Company’s effective
        tax rate is primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of pretax
        earnings.

Liquidity
        and Capital Resources

The
        Company’s objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and
        financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a
        capital intensive agricultural-based commodity business.

MANAGEMENT’S
                  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                  (Continued)

At
        June
        30, 2007, the Company continued to show substantial liquidity with working
        capital of $7.3 billion and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided
        by current liabilities, of 1.9 to 1.  Included in working capital is
        $875 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities
        as
        well as $4.4 billion of readily marketable commodity
        inventories.  Cash generated from operating activities totaled $303
        million for the year compared to $1.4 billion last year.  This
        decrease was primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements
        principally related to increased prices and quantities of agricultural commodity
        inventories and increased receivables, partially offset by increased cash
        earnings.  Despite increased investment in property, plant, and
        equipment, cash used in investing activities decreased $714 million for the
        year
        to $355 million due primarily to increased sales of marketable securities
        and
        proceeds from sales of businesses including the sale of the Company’s equity
        interests in Tyson Foods, Inc., Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. and Agricore
        United.  Cash used in financing activities was $398 million compared
        to cash generated by financing activities of $284 million last
        year.  Net long-term borrowings increased primarily as a result of the
        issuance of $1.2 billion of convertible senior notes in February 2007 (described
        in detail below), compared to $600 million of 30-year debentures issued in
        September 2005.  This increase was partially offset by $283 million of
        increased payments on long-term debt principally related to the Company retiring
        $400 million of debentures in 2007.

Capital
        resources were strengthened as shown by the increase in the Company’s net worth
        from $9.8 billion to $11.3 billion.  The Company’s ratio of long-term
        debt to total capital (the sum of the Company’s long-term debt and shareholders’
equity) was 30% at June 30, 2007, and 29% at June 30, 2006.  This
        ratio is a measure of the Company’s long-term liquidity and is an indicator of
        financial flexibility.  The Company currently has $3.9 billion of
        commercial paper and commercial bank lines available to meet seasonal cash
        requirements of which $2.6 billion are committed and

$1.3

billion are uncommitted.  At June 30, 2007, the Company had
        $468 million of short-term debt outstanding.  Standard & Poor’s,
        Moody’s, and Fitch rate the Company’s commercial paper as A-1, P-1, and F1,
        respectively, and rate the Company’s long-term debt as A, A2, and A+,
        respectively.  In addition to the cash flow generated from operations,
        the Company has access to equity and debt capital through numerous alternatives
        from public and private sources in domestic and international
        markets.

In
        February 2007, the Company issued $1.2 billion principal amount of convertible
        senior notes due in 2014 (the Notes) in a private placement.  The
        Notes were issued at par and bear interest at a rate of 0.875% per year,
        payable
        semiannually.  The Notes are convertible based on an initial
        conversion rate of 22.8343 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which
        is
        equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $43.79 per
        share).  The Notes may be converted, subject to adjustment, only under
        the following circumstances: 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after
        March 31, 2007, if the closing price of the Company’s common stock for at least
        20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
        day of the immediately preceding quarter is more than 140% of the applicable
        conversion price per share, which is $1,000 divided by the then applicable
        conversion rate, 2) during the five consecutive business day period immediately
        after any five consecutive trading day period (the note measurement period)
        in
        which the average of the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes
        was
        equal to or less than 98% of the average of the product of the closing price
        of
        the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate at each date during the note
        measurement period, 3) if the Company makes specified distributions to its
        common stockholders or specified corporate transactions occur, or 4) at any
        time
        on or after January 15, 2014, through the business day preceding the maturity
        date.  Upon conversion, a holder would receive an amount in cash equal
        to the lesser of 1) $1,000 and 2) the conversion value, as
        defined.  If the conversion value exceeds $1,000, the Company will
        deliver, at the Company’s election, cash or common stock or a combination of
        cash and common stock for the conversion value in excess of
        $1,000.  If the Notes are converted in connection with a change in
        control, as defined, the Company may be required to provide a make-whole
        premium
        in the form of an

increase
        in the conversion rate, subject to a stated maximum amount.  In
        addition, in the event of a change in control, the holders may require the
        Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal
        to
        100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
        if
        any.

                  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                  (Continued)

Concurrent
        with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call options in private
        transactions at a cost of $299 million.  The purchased call options
        allow the Company to receive shares of its common stock and/or cash from
        the
        counterparties equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to
        the
        excess of the current market price of the Company’s common stock over the
        exercise price of the purchased call options.  In addition, the
        Company sold warrants in private transactions to acquire, subject to customary
        anti-dilution adjustments, 26.3 million shares of its common stock at an
        exercise price of $62.56 per share and received proceeds of $170
        million.  If the average price of the Company’s common stock during a
        defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds
        the
        exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be settled, at the Company’s
        option, in cash or shares of common stock.  The purchased call options
        and warrants are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future
        conversions of the Notes by effectively increasing the initial conversion
        price
        to $62.56 per share.

Upon
        closing of the sale of the Notes, $370 million of the net proceeds from the
        Note
        issuance and the proceeds from the warrant transactions were used to repurchase
        10.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock under the Company’s stock
        repurchase program.

As
        of June
        30, 2007, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the Notes had been
        satisfied.  In addition, as of June 30, 2007, the market price of the
        Company’s common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased
        call options or warrants.

Contractual
        Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In
        the
        normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments
        which obligate the Company to make payments in the future.  The
        following table sets forth the Company’s significant future obligations by time
        period.  Purchases include commodity-based contracts entered into in
        the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A,
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” energy-related
        purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other
        purchase obligations related to the Company’s normal business
        activities.  Where applicable, information included in the Company’s
        consolidated financial statements and notes is cross-referenced in this
        table.

MANAGEMENT’S

                  (Continued)

At
        June
        30, 2007, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $3.0 billion
        over
        the next four years to complete approved capital projects and
        acquisitions.  The Company is a limited partner in various private
        equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets.  At June 30,
        2007, the Company’s carrying value of these limited partnership investments was
        $165 million.  The Company has future capital commitments related to
        these partnerships of $138 million and expects the majority of these additional
        capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated
        by the
        partnerships.  The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and
        surety bonds of $339 million at June 30, 2007.

In
        addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee
        agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the Company
        to make future payments.  The Company’s liability under these
        agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual
        obligation.  The Company has collateral for a portion of these
        contingent obligations.  At June 30, 2007, these contingent
        obligations totaled approximately $98 million.  Amounts outstanding
        for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $51 million
        at
        June 30, 2007.

Critical
        Accounting Policies

The
        process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates
        and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Company’s assets and
        liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and
        expenses.  These estimates and judgments are based on the Company’s
        historical experience and management’s knowledge and understanding of current
        facts and circumstances.  Certain of the Company’s accounting policies
        are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction
        of the
        Company’s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by
        management.  Management has discussed with the Company’s Audit
        Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these
        critical accounting policies.  Following are the accounting policies
        management considers critical to the Company’s financial statements.

Inventories
        and Derivatives

Certain
        of
        the Company’s merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward
        fixed-price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange-traded futures and
        options
        contracts are valued at estimated market values.  These merchandisable
        agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and
        may
        be sold without significant additional processing.  Management
        estimates market value based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences
        in local markets.  Changes in the market values of these inventories
        and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component
        of cost
        of products sold.  If management used different methods or factors to
        estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products
        sold
        could differ.  Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to
        year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products
        sold could differ.

The
        Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts to fix the purchase
        price
        of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a
        future
        month, to fix the purchase price of the Company’s anticipated natural gas
        requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price
        of
        anticipated volumes of ethanol.  These derivative contracts are
        designated as cash flow hedges.  The change in the market value of
        such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue
        to
        be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged
        item.  Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging
        transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable
        income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold in the
        statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.  If it is
        determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at
        offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the
        market value of these exchange-traded futures contracts would be recorded
        in the
        statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.

Employee
        Benefit Plans

The
        Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain
        international subsidiaries with pension benefits.  The Company also
        provides substantially all domestic salaried employees with postretirement
        health care and life insurance benefits.  In order to measure the
        expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes
        several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount
        certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans,
        rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality
        rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions
        are based on the Company’s historical experience combined with management’s
        knowledge and understanding of current facts and
        circumstances.  Management also uses third-party specialists to assist
        in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit
        plans.  If management used different estimates and assumptions
        regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly,
        and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future
        periods.

Income
        Taxes

The
        Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities
        regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions
        regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income
        among
        various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with
        various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for probable
        exposures.  Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax
        deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit
        has
        already been recognized in the Company’s income
        statement.  Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the
        Company’s tax planning strategies.  Valuation allowances related to
        these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization
        of
        the tax benefit is not probable.  Based on management’s evaluation of
        the Company’s tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax
        exposures are appropriately accrued.  To the extent the Company were
        to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or
        be
        required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Company’s
        effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be
        impacted.

Undistributed
        earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint
        ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently
        reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been
        provided thereon.  If the Company were to receive distributions from
        any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed
        earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently
        reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have
        not
        been provided for in the consolidated financial statements.

Asset
        Abandonments and Write-Downs

The
        Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting,
        storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and
        products.  This business is global in nature and is highly
        capital-intensive.  Both the availability of the Company’s raw
        materials and the demand for the Company’s finished products are driven by
        unpredictable factors such as weather, plantings, government (domestic and
        foreign) farm programs and policies, changes in population growth, changes
        in
        standards of living, and production of similar and competitive
        crops.  These aforementioned unpredictable factors, therefore, may
        cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Company’s raw materials and
        finished products.  Any such shift will cause management to evaluate
        the efficiency and profitability of the Company’s fixed asset base in terms of
        geographic location, size, and age of its factories.  The Company,
        from time to time, will also invest in equipment and technology related to
        new,
        value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and
        products.  These new products are not always successful from either a
        commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the
        Company’s property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of
        impairment exist.  Assets are abandoned after consideration of the
        ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the
        assets
        in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying
        value.  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its
        evaluation of this fixed asset base, then the Company could recognize different
        amounts of expense over future periods.

Valuation
        of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates

The
        Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as
        available-for-sale and carries these securities at fair
        value.  Investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in
        undistributed earnings.  For publicly traded securities, the fair
        value of the Company’s investments is readily available based on quoted market
        prices.  For non-publicly traded securities, management’s assessment
        of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash
        flows and estimates of sales proceeds.  In the event of a decline in
        fair value of an investment below carrying value, management may be required
        to
        determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary.  In
        evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment,
        management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted
        cash
        flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well
        as the
        Company’s ability and intent to hold the investment.  When such a
        decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss
        is
        recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline.
        See Notes 3 and 5 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for
        information regarding the Company’s marketable securities and investments in
        affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its
        evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize
        different amounts of expense over future periods.

                  (Continued)

The
        Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest
        primarily in emerging markets.  The Company accounts for these limited
        partnerships using the equity method of accounting.  Therefore, the
        Company is recording in the consolidated statement of earnings its proportional
        share of the limited partnerships’ net income or loss.  The limited
        partnerships value their investments at fair value.  Thus, unrealized
        gains and losses related to the change in fair value of these investments
        are
        recorded in the limited partnerships’ statements of earnings.  The
        valuation of these investments, as determined by the general partner, can
        be
        subjective, and the values may vary significantly.  Some of the
        factors causing the subjectivity and volatility of these valuations include
        the
        illiquidity and minority positions of these investments, currency exchange
        rate
        fluctuations, less-regulated securities exchanges, and the inherent business
        risks and limitations present in the emerging market countries.  The
        Company records the results of these limited partnerships based on the
        information provided to the Company by the general partner. Due to the
        subjectivity and volatility in valuing these investments, the fair value
        of
        these investments, and thus the Company’s results, could vary significantly over
        future periods.

QUANTITATIVE
                  AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
                  RISK

The
        market
        risk inherent in the Company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions
        is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodities futures
        prices, marketable equity security prices, market prices of limited
        partnerships’ investments, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates
        as described below.

Commodities

The
        availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide
        fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather, plantings, government
        (domestic and foreign) farm programs and policies, changes in global demand
        resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and
        global
        production of similar and competitive crops. To reduce price risk caused
        by
        market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using
        exchange-traded futures and options contracts to minimize its net position
        of
        merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase
        and
        sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange-traded futures and options
        contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance
        margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly
        impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the
        value
        of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the
        underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of
        freight markets. In addition, the Company from time-to-time enters into
        derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of
        commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month.
        The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically
        been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting
        changes
        in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open
        and
        closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net
        of
        applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold
        in the
        statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.

QUANTITATIVE
                  AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
                  (Continued)

A
        sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Company’s exposure to
        market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Company’s daily net
        commodity position consists of inventories, related purchase and sale contracts,
        and exchange-traded futures contracts, including those contracts used to
        hedge
        portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity
        position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity
        by
        valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated
        as
        the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse
        change in such prices.  Actual results may differ.

The
        change
        in fair value of the average position for 2007 compared to 2006 was principally
        a result of changes in the daily net commodity position and commodity
        prices.

Marketable
        Equity Securities

Marketable
        equity securities, which are recorded at fair value, have exposure to price
        risk. The fair value of marketable equity securities is based on quoted market
        prices. Risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from
        a
        hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted market prices. Actual results may
        differ.

The

        disposals of securities partially offset by increases in fair market value
        of
        certain securities.

Limited
        Partnerships

The
        Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest
        primarily in emerging markets.  The Company accounts for these limited
        partnerships using the equity method of accounting.  Therefore, the
        Company is recording in the consolidated statement of earnings its proportional
        share of the limited partnerships’ net income or loss.  The limited
        partnerships value their investments at fair value.  Risk is estimated
        as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse
        change in market prices of the limited partnerships’
investments.  Actual results may differ.

Currencies

In
        order
        to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except
        for
        amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy
        of
        entering into currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate its foreign
        currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than
        the
        functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities. The
        instruments used are readily marketable exchange-traded futures contracts
        and
        forward contracts with banks. The changes in market value of such contracts
        have
        a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related
        transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position
        resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange
        rates is not material.

The
        amount
        the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and
        affiliates and translated into dollars using the year-end exchange rates
        is $5.4
        billion at June 30, 2007, and $4.5 billion at June 30, 2006.  This
        increase is due to an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries
        and affiliates and appreciation of foreign currency exchange
        rates.  The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical
        10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $543 million
        and
        $454 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Actual results may
        differ.

Interest

The
        fair
        value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices,
        where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Company’s current
        incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
        Such
        fair value exceeded the long-term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated
        as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5
        %
        decrease in interest rates.  Actual results may differ.

Summary
                of Significant Accounting
                Policies

Nature
      of Business

The
      Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing,
      and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.

Principles
      of Consolidation

The
      consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2007, and for the three years
      then ended include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned
      subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
      have been eliminated.  Investments in affiliates are carried at cost
      plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition.

The
      Company evaluates its less than majority-owned investments for consolidation
      pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation Number
      46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of
      Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

(FIN 46).  A variable
      interest entity (VIE) is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal
      structure used for business purposes that does not have equity investors with
      voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial
      resources for the entity to support its activities.  FIN 46 requires a
      VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is the primary beneficiary
      of the VIE.  The primary beneficiary of a VIE is an entity that is
      subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE’s activities or entitled
      to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns, or both.  As
      of June 30, 2007, the Company has $165 million of investments in private equity
      funds included in investments in affiliates which are considered VIEs pursuant
      to FIN 46.  The Company’s residual risk and rewards from these VIEs
      are proportional to the Company’s ownership interest and the Company is not the
      primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs.  Therefore, the Company does
      not consolidate any of these VIEs.

Use
      of
      Estimates

The
      preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally
      accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial
      statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

Cash
      Equivalents

The
      Company considers all non-segregated, highly-liquid investments with a maturity
      of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash
      equivalents.

Segregated
      Cash and Investments

The
      Company segregates certain cash and investment balances in accordance with
      certain regulatory requirements, commodity exchange requirements, and insurance
      arrangements.  These segregated balances represent deposits received
      from customers trading in exchange-traded commodity instruments, securities
      pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses, and cash and securities pledged
      as
      security under certain insurance arrangements.  Segregated cash and
      investments primarily consist of cash, United States government securities,
      and
      money-market funds.

Receivables

The
      Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable
      value.  This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated
      uncollectible accounts, $69 million and $54 million at June 30, 2007 and 2006,
      respectively, to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable
      balances.  The Company calculates this allowance based on its history
      of write-offs, level of past-due accounts, and its relationships with, and
      the
      economic status of, its customers.

Summary
                of Significant Accounting Policies
                (Continued)

Credit
      risk on trade receivables is minimized as a result of the large and diversified
      nature of the Company’s worldwide customer base.  The Company controls
      its exposure to credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits, and
      monitoring procedures.  Collateral is generally not required for the
      Company’s trade receivables.  Trade accounts receivable due from
      unconsolidated affiliates as of June 30, 2007 and 2006 was $260 million and
      $58
      million, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories
      of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include amounts
      acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market
      value.  In addition, the Company values certain inventories using the
      lower of cost, determined by either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or last-in,
      first-out (LIFO) methods, or market.

Marketable
      Securities

The
      Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale, except
      for
      certain designated securities which are classified as trading securities.
      Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized
      gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported as a component of other
      comprehensive income.  Unrealized gains and losses related to trading
      securities are included in income on a current basis.  The Company
      uses the specific identification method when securities are sold or reclassified
      out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.

Property,
      Plant, and Equipment

Property,
      plant, and equipment is recorded at cost.  Repair and maintenance
      costs are expensed as incurred. The Company generally uses the straight-line
      method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally
      uses accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for
      depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following
      ranges of asset lives: buildings - 10 to 50 years; machinery and equipment
      - 3
      to 30 years.

Asset
      Abandonments and Write-Downs

The
      Company recorded a $21 million, a $71 million, and a $42 million charge in
      cost
      of products sold during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, principally related
      to the abandonment and write-down of certain long-lived assets.  The
      majority of these assets were idle or related to underperforming product lines,
      and the decision to abandon was finalized after consideration of the ability
      to
      utilize the assets for their intended purpose, employ the assets in alternative
      uses, or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  After the
      write-downs, the carrying value of these assets is immaterial.

Net
      Sales

The
      Company follows a policy of recognizing sales revenue at the time of delivery
      of
      the product and when all of the following have occurred: a sales agreement
      is in
      place, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably
      assured.  Freight costs and handling charges related to sales are
      recorded as a component of cost of products sold.  Net sales to
      unconsolidated affiliates during 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $3.7 billion, $3.1
      billion, and $2.9 billion, respectively.

Summary
                of Significant Accounting Policies
                (Continued)

Stock
      Compensation

Effective
      July 1, 2004, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
      SFAS
      Number 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, for stock-based
      employee compensation. Under the modified prospective method of adoption
      selected by the Company under the provisions of SFAS Number 148,

Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure

, stock-based
      employee compensation expense recognized during 2005 was the same as the expense
      which would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions
      of
      SFAS Number 123 been applied to all options granted after July 1,
      1995.  Effective     July 1, 2005, the
      Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS Number 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

, using the modified prospective transition
      method.  Under the modified prospective transition method,
      compensation expense includes: (a) compensation expense for all share-based
      payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, July 1, 2005 based on
      the
      grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions
      of
      SFAS Number 123; and (b) compensation expense for all share-based payments
      granted subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
      estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS Number
      123(R).  Results of prior periods have not been restated.

Per
      Share Data

Basic
      earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings by the
      weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  In computing
      diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of common shares
      outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise
      prices lower than the average market prices of common shares.  During
      2007, 2006, and 2005, diluted average shares outstanding included incremental
      shares related to outstanding common stock options of 5 million, 2 million,
      and
      2 million, respectively.

New
      Accounting Standards

During
      July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation Number 48,

Accounting for
      Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48)

.  FIN 48 clarifies the
      accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum requirements a tax
      position must meet before being recognized in the financial
      statements.  In addition, FIN 48 prohibits the use of SFAS Number 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, in evaluating the recognition and
      measurement of uncertain tax positions.  The Company is required to
      adopt FIN 48 on July 1, 2007, and the adoption is not expected to have a
      material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

During
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS Number 157,

Fair Value
      Measurements

.  SFAS Number 157 establishes a framework for
      measuring fair value within generally accepted accounting principles, clarifies
      the definition of fair value within that framework, and expands disclosures
      about the use of fair value measurements.  SFAS Number 157 does not
      require any new fair value measurements in generally accepted accounting
      principles.  However, the definition of fair value in SFAS Number 157
      may affect assumptions used by companies in determining fair
      value.  The Company will be required to adopt SFAS Number 157 on July
      1, 2008.  The Company has not completed its evaluation, but currently
      believes the impact will not require material modification of the Company’s fair
      value measurements and will be substantially limited to expanded disclosures
      in
      the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

During
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS Number 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
      Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

.  SFAS Number
      158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status
      of a
      defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an
      asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded
      status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in comprehensive income in
      the
      year in which the changes occur. SFAS Number 158 also requires companies to
      measure the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as of the
      end
      of the fiscal year instead of a date up to three months prior to the end of
      the
      fiscal year.  At June 30, 2007, the Company recorded the funded status
      of its defined benefit postretirement plans in the accompanying consolidated
      balance

sheet.  The
      impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet resulting from recording the
      funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans is disclosed in Note
      13.  The Company will be required to adopt the measurement date
      provisions of SFAS Number 158 on June 30, 2009, and does not believe such
      adoption will have a significant impact on the Company’s financial
      statements.

Summary

                (Continued)

During
      February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS Number 159,

The Fair Value Option for
      Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

.  SFAS Number 159
      allows entities to voluntarily choose, at specified election dates, to measure
      many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. The election
      is
      made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. If the fair value
      option is elected for an instrument, SFAS Number 159 specifies that all
      subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument shall be reported in
      earnings.  The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 159 on July
      1, 2008, and has not yet assessed the impact of the adoption of this standard
      on
      the Company’s financial statements.

Note
                2.

Acquisitions

The
      2007,
      2006, and 2005 acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with
      SFAS Number 141,

Business Combinations.

Accordingly, the
      tangible assets and liabilities have been adjusted to fair values with the
      remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill.  The
      identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of these acquisitions are not
      material.

      Acquisitions

During
      2007, the Company acquired seven businesses for a total cost of $103
      million.  In one of these acquisitions, the Company acquired the
      remaining outstanding shares of an unconsolidated affiliate.  Prior to
      obtaining the remaining outstanding shares, the Company held a 50% interest
      in
      the unconsolidated affiliate and accounted for this investment on the equity
      method of accounting.  The carrying value of the Company’s investment
      in the unconsolidated affiliate immediately prior to the acquisition was $100
      million.

The
      Company has recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price related
      to
      the 2007 acquisitions.  The purchase price allocation resulted in
      goodwill of $6 million which was assigned to the Oilseeds Processing
      segment.  The cash purchase price of $103 million plus the $100
      million carrying value of the previously unconsolidated affiliate was allocated
      to current assets, property, plant, and equipment, current liabilities, and
      debt
      for $82 million, $206 million, $33 million, and $52 million,
      respectively.

      Acquisitions

During
      2006, the Company acquired twelve businesses for a total cost of $182
      million.  The Company recorded no goodwill related to these
      acquisitions.  The portion of the purchase price allocated to current
      assets, property, plant, and equipment, other long-term assets, and current
      liabilities, was $64 million, $79 million, $59 million, and $25 million,
      respectively.

      Acquisitions

During
      2005, the Company acquired five businesses for a total cost of $24
      million.  The Company recorded no goodwill related to these
      acquisitions.

Of
      the $27
      million in unrealized losses at June 30, 2007, $2 million of unrealized losses
      arose within the last 12 months, $1 million of unrealized losses arose within
      the last 24 months, $21 million of unrealized losses arose within the last
      months, and the remaining $3 million of unrealized losses arose within the
      last
      48 months.  The market value of United States government obligations,
      government-sponsored enterprise obligations, corporate debt securities, and
      other debt securities with unrealized losses as of June 30, 2007, is $434
      million.  The $10 million of unrealized losses associated with United
      States government obligations, government-sponsored enterprise obligations,
      corporate debt securities, and other debt securities are not considered to
      be
      other-than-temporary because their unrealized losses are related to changes
      in
      interest rates and do not affect the expected cash flows to be received upon
      maturity of these investments or the credit quality of the
      issuer.  The market value of two available-for-sale equity securities
      with unrealized losses as of June 30, 2007, is $45 million.  The $17
      million of unrealized losses associated with these available-for-sale equity
      securities arose within the last 36 months and are principally related to
      long-term strategic investments. The Company has the intent and ability to hold
      its debt and equity securities for a period of time sufficient to recover all
      unrealized losses.  The Company has not recognized any
      other-than-temporary impairments for its debt and equity

Inventories
                and Derivatives

To
      reduce
      price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy
      of using exchange-traded futures and options contracts to minimize its net
      position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash
      purchase and sales contracts.  The Company will also use
      exchange-traded futures and options contracts as components of merchandising
      strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these
      strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility
      of
      the relationship between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures
      contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty
      contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets.  Inventories of
      certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include amounts acquired
      under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market
      value.  Exchange-traded futures and options contracts, forward cash
      purchase contracts, and forward cash sales contracts of merchandisable
      agricultural commodities, none of which are designated as fair value hedges,
      are
      valued at market price.  Changes in the market value of inventories of
      merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales
      contracts, and exchange-traded futures contracts are recognized in earnings
      immediately, resulting in cost of goods sold approximating first-in, first-out
      (FIFO) cost.  Unrealized gains on forward cash purchase contracts,
      forward cash sales contracts, and exchange-traded futures contracts represent
      the fair value of such instruments and are classified on the Company’s balance
      sheet as receivables.  Unrealized losses on forward cash purchase
      contracts, forward cash sales contracts, and exchange-traded futures contracts
      represent the fair value of such instruments and are classified on the Company’s
      balance sheet as accounts payable.

The
      Company also values certain inventories using the lower of cost, determined
      by
      either the LIFO or FIFO method, or market.

Inventories
                and Derivatives
                (Continued)

The
      Company, from time to time, uses futures contracts to fix the purchase price
      of
      anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future
      month.  The Company also uses futures, options, and swaps to fix the
      purchase price of the Company’s anticipated natural gas requirements for certain
      production facilities.  In addition, certain of the Company’s ethanol
      sales contracts are indexed to unleaded gasoline prices.  The Company
      uses futures and options to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of these
      ethanol sales in future months.  These derivatives are designated as
      cash flow hedges.  The changes in the market value of such derivative
      contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly
      effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged
      item.  The amounts representing the ineffectiveness of these cash flow
      hedges are immaterial.  Gains and losses arising from open and closed
      hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of
      applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products
      sold
      in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.  As
      of June 30, 2007, the Company has recorded $16 million of after-tax losses
      in
      accumulated other comprehensive income related to gains and losses from cash
      flow hedge transactions.  The Company expects to recognize these
      after-tax losses in the statement of earnings during fiscal 2008.

At
      June
      30, 2007, accumulated other comprehensive income included a $7 million after-tax
      gain related to a treasury-lock agreement entered into and settled during
      2006.  This treasury-lock agreement was designated as a cash flow
      hedge of the anticipated proceeds from the Company’s issuance of $600 million of
      debentures in September 2005.  The Company will recognize the $7
      million after-tax gain in the statement of earnings over the term of the
      debentures.  At June 30, 2007, accumulated other comprehensive income
      also included $3 million in after-tax gains representing the Company’s share of
      derivative gains reported by unconsolidated affiliates of the
      Company.

Investments

The
      Company has ownership interests in non-majority-owned affiliates accounted
      for
      under the equity method.  The Company had 79 and 89 unconsolidated
      affiliates as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, located in North and
      South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia.  The decrease in the number
      of affiliates in 2007 is principally due to the exchange of the Company’s
      ownership interest in 11 affiliates for shares of stock in a new
      affiliate.  The following table summarizes the combined balance sheets
      and the combined statements of earnings of the Company’s unconsolidated

Undistributed
      earnings of the Company’s unconsolidated affiliates as of June 30, 2007, are
      $656 million.  The company is a limited partner in various private
      equity funds which have a carrying value at June 30, 2007 of $165
      million.  The Company has future capital commitments related to these
      partnerships of $138 million as of June 30, 2007.  Two foreign
      affiliates for which the Company has a carrying value of $1.1 billion have
      a
      market value of $1.3 billion based on quoted market prices and exchange rates
      at
      June 30, 2007.

The
      Company provides a $200 million credit facility to one unconsolidated
      affiliate.  The facility is due on demand and bears interest equal to
      the monthly average commercial paper rate applicable to the Company’s commercial
      paper borrowing facility.  Outstanding advances under the credit
      facility of $180 million as of June 30, 2007, are included in receivables
      in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

During
      2007 the Company sold its 28% ownership interest in Agricore United for
      cash of $321 million and recognized a gain of $153 million.

During
      June 2007, the Company exchanged its ownership interests in eleven Asian joint
      venture companies for shares of Wilmar International Limited (WIL), a Singapore
      publicly listed company.  In exchange for its ownership interests in
      the joint ventures, the Company received 366 million WIL shares with a fair
      value of $756 million.  Immediately prior to the exchange, the
      carrying value of the Company’s interests in the joint ventures exchanged for
      WIL shares was $231 million.  The Company has accounted for the
      exchange transaction in accordance with SFAS Number 153,

Exchanges of
      Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB No. 29.

Pursuant to SFAS
      Number 153, accounting for nonmonetary transactions should be based upon the
      fair value of the assets received with gain or loss recognized for any
      difference between the fair value of the asset received and the cost of the
      asset surrendered.  Accordingly, the Company has recognized a $440
      million gain in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings related
      to
      the exchange transaction.  The gain represents the difference between
      the fair value of the WIL shares received and the carrying value of the
      Company’s interests in the joint ventures exchanged for WIL shares less the
      elimination of the portion of the gain representing the Company’s retained
      direct and indirect ownership interests in WIL.  The Company is
      accounting for its direct and indirect interests in WIL on the equity method
      of
      accounting as the Company believes it has the ability to exercise significant
      influence over the operating and financial policies of WIL.

As
      of June
      30, 2007, there is one joint venture company subject to the exchange transaction
      in which regulatory approval is pending.  The Company has not
      recognized any gain related to the exchange of this joint venture with WIL
      as of
      June 30, 2007.  The exchange transaction and the related gain for this
      joint venture will be recognized when, and if, final regulatory approval is
      obtained.

Debt
                and Financing Arrangements
                (Continued)

In
      February 2007, the Company issued $1.2 billion principal amount of convertible
      senior notes due in 2014 (the Notes) in a private placement.  The
      Notes were issued at par and bear interest at a rate of 0.875% per year, payable
      semiannually.  The Notes are convertible based on an initial
      conversion rate of 22.8343 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which
      is
      equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $43.79 per
      share).  The Notes may be converted, subject to adjustment, only under
      the following circumstances: 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after
      March 31, 2007, if the closing price of the Company’s common stock for at least
      20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
      day of the immediately preceding quarter is more than 140% of the applicable
      conversion price per share, which is $1,000 divided by the then applicable
      conversion rate, 2) during the five consecutive business day period immediately
      after any five consecutive trading day period (the note measurement period)
      in
      which the average of the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes
      was
      equal to or less than 98% of the average of the product of the closing price
      of
      the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate at each date during the note
      measurement period, 3) if the Company makes specified distributions to its
      common stockholders or specified corporate transactions occur, or 4) at any
      time
      on or after January 15, 2014, through the business day preceding the maturity
      date.  Upon conversion, a holder would receive an amount in cash equal
      to the lesser of 1) $1,000 and 2) the conversion value, as
      defined.  If the conversion value exceeds $1,000, the Company will
      deliver, at the Company’s election, cash or common stock or a combination of
      cash and common stock for the conversion value in excess of
      $1,000.  If the Notes are converted in connection with a change in
      control, as defined, the Company may be required to provide a make-whole premium
      in the form of an increase in the conversion rate, subject to a stated maximum
      amount.  In addition, in the event of a change in control, the holders
      may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a
      purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued
      and unpaid interest, if any.

Concurrent
      with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call options in private
      transactions at a cost of $299 million.  The purchased call options
      allow the Company to receive shares of its common stock and/or cash from the
      counterparties equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to
      the
      excess of the current market price of the Company’s common stock over the
      exercise price of the purchased call options.  In addition, the
      Company sold warrants in private transactions to acquire, subject to customary
      anti-dilution adjustments, 26.3 million shares of its common stock at an
      exercise price of $62.56 per share and received proceeds of $170
      million.  If the average price of the Company’s common stock during a
      defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the
      exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be settled, at the Company’s
      option, in cash or shares of common stock.  The purchased call options
      and warrants are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future
      conversions of the Notes by effectively increasing the initial conversion price
      to $62.56 per share.  The net cost of the purchased call options and
      warrant transactions of $130 million is recorded as a reduction of stockholder’s
      equity.  The Company has also recorded a $114 million increase in
      stockholder’s equity for the deferred tax assets recognized related to the
      purchased call options.

Upon
      closing of the sale of the Notes, $370 million of the net proceeds from the
      Note
      issuance and the proceeds from the warrant transactions were used to repurchase
      10.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock under the Company’s stock
      repurchase program.

As
      of June
      30, 2007, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the Notes had been
      satisfied.  In addition, as of June 30, 2007, the market price of the
      Company’s common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased
      call options or warrants.  As of June 30, 2007, no share amounts
      related to the conversion of the Notes or exercise of the warrants are included
      in diluted average shares outstanding.

At
      June
      30, 2007, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt exceeded the carrying
      value by $110 million, as estimated by using quoted market prices or discounted
      future cash flows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for
      similar types of borrowing arrangements.

The
      Company has authorized one billion shares of common stock and 500,000 shares
      of
      preferred stock, each without par value.  No preferred stock has been
      issued.  At June 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company had approximately 28.6
      million and 16.3 million shares, respectively, in treasury.  Treasury
      stock of $723 million at June 30, 2007, and $238 million at June 30, 2006,
      is
      recorded at cost as a reduction of common stock.

The
      Company’s employee stock compensation plans provide for the granting of options
      to employees to purchase common stock of the Company pursuant to the Company’s
      1996 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan, and 2002 Incentive
      Compensation Plan.  These options are issued at market value on the
      date of grant, vest over one to nine years, and expire five to ten years after
      the date of grant.

The
      Company’s 1999 and 2002 Incentive Compensation Plans provide for the granting of
      restricted stock awards at no cost to certain officers and key
      employees.  The awarded shares are made in common stock and vest at
      the end of a three-year restriction period.  During 2007, 2006, and
      2005, 1.1 million, 2.4 million, and 2.5 million common shares, respectively,
      were granted as restricted stock awards.  At June 30, 2007, there were
      1.2 million and 10.6 million shares available for future grants pursuant to
      the
      1999 and 2002 plans, respectively.

Compensation
      expense for option grants and restricted stock awards granted to employees
      is
      generally recognized on a straight-line basis during the service period of
      the
      respective grant.  Certain of the Company’s option grants and
      restricted stock awards continue to vest upon the recipient’s retirement from
      the Company and compensation expense related to option grants and restricted
      stock awards granted to retirement eligible employees is recognized in earnings
      on the date of grant.  Total compensation expense for option grants
      and restricted stock awards recognized during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $70
      million, $67 million, and $29 million, respectively.

Shareholder’s
                Equity (Continued)

The
      fair
      value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the
      Black-Scholes single option pricing model.  The volatility assumption
      used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model is based on the historical
      volatility of the Company’s stock.  The volatility of the Company’s
      stock was calculated based upon the monthly closing price of the Company’s stock
      for the eight year period immediately prior to the date of grant.  The
      average expected life represents the period of time that option grants are
      expected to be outstanding.  The risk-free rate is based on the rate
      of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected
      life of option grants.  The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes
      single option pricing model are as follows.

A
      summary
      of option activity during 2007 is presented below:

The
      weighted-average remaining contractual term of options outstanding and
      exercisable at June 30, 2007, is 7 years and 5 years,
      respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding
      and exercisable at June 30, 2007, is $125 million and $42 million,
      respectively.  The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options
      granted during 2007, 2006, and 2005, were $16.42, $7.52, and $5.41
      respectively.  The total intrinsic values of options exercised during
      2007, 2006, and 2005, were $41 million, $60 million, and $33 million,
      respectively.  Cash proceeds received from options exercised during
      2007, 2006, and 2005, were $20 million, $30 million, and $31 million,
      respectively.

At
      June
      30, 2007, there was $34 million of total unrecognized compensation expense
      related to option grants.  Amounts to be recognized as compensation
      expense during the next five fiscal years are $12 million, $10 million, $7
      million, $4 million, and $1 million, respectively.

Income
                Taxes (Continued)

The
      Company has $82 million and $85 million of tax assets for net operating loss
      carryforwards related to certain international subsidiaries at June 30, 2007
      and
      2006, respectively.  As of June 30, 2007, approximately $70 million of
      these assets have no expiration date, and the remaining $12 million expire
      at
      various times through fiscal 2016.  The annual usage of certain of
      these assets is limited to a percentage of the taxable income of the respective
      international subsidiary for the year.  The Company has recorded a
      valuation allowance of $52 million and $59 million against these tax assets
      at
      June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, due to the uncertainty of their
      realization.  The Company also has $44 million of tax assets related
      to excess foreign tax credits which begin to expire in fiscal 2013 and $17
      million of tax assets related to state income tax incentive credits net of
      federal benefit which expire at various times through fiscal
      2011.  The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $15 million
      against the excess foreign tax credits and $1 million against the state income
      tax incentive credits at June 30, 2007, due to the uncertainty of their
      realization.  As of June 30, 2006, the Company had no valuation
      allowance recorded related to excess foreign tax credits and a $14 million
      valuation allowance related to state income tax incentive credits.

Undistributed
      earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint
      venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately
      $3.6 billion at June 30, 2007, are considered to be permanently reinvested,
      and
      accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided
      thereon.  It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax
      liability for temporary differences related to these undistributed
      earnings.

Leases

The
      Company leases manufacturing and warehouse facilities, real estate,
      transportation assets, and other equipment under non-cancelable operating leases
      which expire at various dates through the year 2076. Rent expense for 2007,
      2006, and 2005 was $166 million, $129 million, and $116 million, respectively.
      Future minimum rental payments for non-cancelable operating leases with initial
      or remaining terms in excess of one year are as follows:

Employee
                Benefit Plans

The
      Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain
      international subsidiaries with pension benefits.  The Company also
      provides substantially all domestic salaried employees with postretirement
      health care and life insurance benefits.

The
      Company has savings and investment plans available to employees.  The
      Company also maintains stock ownership plans for qualifying
      employees.  The Company contributes shares of its stock to the plans
      to match qualifying employee contributions.  Employees have the choice
      of retaining Company stock in their accounts or diversifying the shares into
      other investment options.  Expense is measured and recorded based upon
      the fair market value of the stock contributed to the plans each
      month.  The number of shares designated for use in the plans is not
      significant compared to the shares outstanding for the periods
      presented.  Assets of the Company’s defined contribution savings plans
      consist primarily of listed common stocks and pooled funds.  The
      Company’s defined contribution savings plans held 19.1 million shares of Company
      common stock at June 30, 2007, with a market value of $631
      million.  Cash dividends received on shares of Company common stock
      held by these plans during the year ended June 30, 2007 were $8
      million.

On
      June
      30, 2007, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of
      SFAS
      Number 158.  SFAS Number 158 required the Company to recognize the
      funded status of its pension plans in the June 30, 2007, consolidated balance
      sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
      income.  The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income at
      adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses, unrecognized prior
      service costs, and unrecognized transition obligation remaining from the initial
      adoption of SFAS Number 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

, all of
      which were previously netted against the plans’ funded status in the Company’s
      consolidated balance sheet pursuant to the provisions of SFAS Number
      87.  These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic
      pension cost pursuant to the Company’s historical accounting policy for
      amortizing such amounts.  Further, actuarial gains and losses that
      arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension
      cost
      in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive
      income.  Those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component
      of net periodic pension cost on the same basis as the amounts recognized in
      accumulated other comprehensive income upon adoption of SFAS Number
      158.

The
      incremental effects of adopting the provisions of SFAS Number 158 on the
      Company’s consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2007 are presented in the
      following table.  The adoption of SFAS Number 158 had no effect on the
      Company’s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2007,
      or for any prior period presented, and it will not effect the Company’s
      operating results in future periods.  Had the Company not been
      required to adopt SFAS Number 158 at June 30, 2007, it would have recognized
      an
      additional minimum liability pursuant to the provisions of SFAS Number
      87.  The effects of recognizing the additional minimum liability is
      included in the table below in the column labeled “Prior to Adopting SFAS Number
      158.”

Included
      in accumulated other comprehensive income for pension benefits at June 30,
      2007,
      are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic
      pension cost: Unrecognized transition obligation of $3 million, unrecognized
      prior service costs of $41 million and unrecognized actuarial losses of $336
      million.  The transition obligation, prior service cost, and actuarial
      loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income and expected to be
      recognized in net periodic pension cost during the fiscal year ended June 30,
      2008, is ($1) million, $6 million, and $17 million, respectively.

Included
      in accumulated other comprehensive income for postretirement benefits at June
      30, 2007, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net
      periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service credits of $9 million and
      unrecognized actuarial losses of $47 million.  The prior service
      credit and actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income
      and
      expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during the fiscal year
      ended June 30, 2008, is $1 million, and $2 million, respectively.

The

      of
      plan assets for the pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess
      of plan assets were $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.4 billion, respectively,
      as of June 30, 2007, and $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.1 billion,
      respectively, as of June 30, 2006.  The projected benefit
      obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for
      the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets
      were  $491 million, $481 million, and $284 million, respectively, as
      of June 30, 2007, and $213 million, $198 million, and $25 million, respectively,
      as of June 30, 2006.  The accumulated benefit obligation for all
      pension plans as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, was $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion,
      respectively.

For
      postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 9.1% annual rate of increase
      in
      the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for
      2007.  The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% for 2016 and
      remain at that level thereafter.

Assumed
      health care cost trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported
      for the health care plans.  A 1% change in assumed health care cost
      trend rates would have the following effect:

Plan
      Assets

The
      following table sets forth the actual asset allocation for the Company’s global
      pension plan assets as of the measurement date:

1.

The
                Company’s U.S. pension plans contain approximately 63% of the Company’s
                global pension plan assets.  The target asset allocation for the
                Company’s U.S. pension plans consists of 60% equity securities, 30% debt
                securities, and 10% real estate.  The actual asset allocation
                for the U.S. pension plans as of the measurement date consists of
                62%
                equity securities, 28% debt securities, and 10% in real
                estate.  The actual asset allocation for the Company’s foreign
                pension plans as of the measurement date consists of 40% equity
                securities, 59% debt securities, and 1% in other
                investments.  The target asset allocation for the Company’s
                foreign pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset
                allocation.

2.

The
                Company’s pension plans held 3.2 million shares of Company common stock as
                of the measurement date, March 31, 2007, with a market value of $119
                million.  Cash dividends received on shares of Company common
                stock by these plans during the twelve-month period ended March 31,
                2007,
                were $1 million.

Investment
      objectives for the Company’s plan assets are to:

·

Optimize
                the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of
                risk.

·

Maintain
                a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment
                managers.

·

Maintain
                careful control of the risk level within each asset
                class.

·

Focus
                on a long-term return objective.

Asset
      allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility
      characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations
      of the pension plans.  Selection of the targeted asset allocation for
      plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk
      characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns
      among
      asset classes.  The U.S. pension plans target asset allocation was
      also based on an asset and liability study concluded in January
      2005.

Investment
      guidelines are established with each investment manager.  These
      guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree
      to
      operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities,
      diversification requirements, and credit quality standards, where
      applicable.  In some countries, derivatives may be used to gain market
      exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be
      used
      to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of underlying
      investments.

External
      consultants monitor the investment strategy and asset mix for the Company’s plan
      assets.  To develop the Company’s expected long-term rate of return
      assumption on plan assets, the Company generally uses long-term historical
      return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability
      studies.  Adjustments are made to the expected long-term rate of
      return assumption when deemed necessary based upon revised expectations of
      future investment performance of the overall investment markets.  The
      expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2007 net periodic
      pension cost for the pension plans was 7.2%.

Segment
                and Geographic Information

The
      Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing,
      and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. The Company’s
      operations are classified into three reportable business segments: Oilseeds
      Processing, Corn Processing, and Agricultural Services.  Each of these
      segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services
      offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are aggregated and
      classified as Other.

The
      Oilseeds Processing segment includes activities related to processing oilseeds
      such as soybeans, cottonseed, sunflower seeds, canola, peanuts, and flaxseed
      into vegetable oils and meals principally for the food and feed
      industries.  In addition, oilseeds may be resold into the marketplace
      as a raw material for other processors.  Crude vegetable oil is sold
“as is” or is further processed by refining, bleaching, and deodorizing into
      salad oils.  Salad oils can be further processed by hydrogenating
      and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food
      products.  Partially refined oil is sold for use in chemicals, paints,
      and other industrial products.  Refined oil can be further processed
      for use in the production of biodiesel.  Oilseed meals are primary
      ingredients used in the manufacture of commercial livestock and poultry
      feeds.  Oilseeds Processing also includes activities related to the
      Company’s interest in Wilmar International Limited, the largest agricultural
      processing business in Asia.

The
      Corn
      Processing segment includes activities related to the production of sweeteners,
      starches, dextrose, and syrups for the food and beverage industry as well as
      activities related to the production, by fermentation, of bioproducts such
      as
      alcohol, amino acids, and other specialty food and feed
      ingredients.

The
      Agricultural Services segment utilizes the Company’s extensive grain elevator
      and transportation network to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural
      commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, and barley, and resells
      these commodities primarily as feed ingredients and as raw materials for the
      agricultural processing industry.  Agricultural Services’ grain
      sourcing and transportation network provides reliable and efficient services
      to
      the Company’s agricultural processing operations.  Also included in
      Agricultural Services are the activities of A.C. Toepfer International, a global
      merchandiser of agricultural commodities and processed products.

Other
      includes the Company’s remaining operations, consisting principally of food,
      feed, and industrial businesses and financial activities.  Food, feed,
      and industrial includes: Wheat Processing, with activities related to the
      production of wheat flour; Cocoa Processing, with activities related to the
      production of chocolate and cocoa products; the production of natural health
      and
      nutrition products; and the production of other food, feed, and industrial
      products.  Financial activities include banking, captive insurance,
      private equity fund investments, and futures commission merchant
      activities.

Intersegment
      sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market.  Operating
      profit for each segment is based on net sales less identifiable operating
      expenses, including an interest charge related to working capital
      usage.  Also included in operating profit are the related equity in
      earnings of affiliates based on the equity method of
      accounting.  General corporate expenses, investment income,
      unallocated interest expense, marketable securities transactions, and FIFO
      to
      LIFO inventory adjustments have been excluded from segment operations and
      classified as Corporate.  Gross additions to property, plant, and
      equipment represent purchases of property, plant, and equipment plus amounts
      allocated to property, plant, and equipment related to acquired
      businesses.

Guarantees
                and Commitments

The
      Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related
      to equity-method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future
      payments if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual
      obligation.  The Company has not recorded a liability for payment of
      these contingent obligations, as the Company believes the fair value of these
      contingent obligations is immaterial.  The Company has collateral for
      a portion of these contingent obligations.  These contingent
      obligations totaled $98 million at June 30, 2007.  Amounts outstanding
      for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $51 million
      at June 30, 2007.

As
      of June
      30, 2007, the Company has under construction new ethanol, biodiesel, PHA, and
      cocoa production facilities.  As of that date, the Company has entered
      into purchase commitments totaling $660 million with third parties related
      to
      the construction of those facilities.

      schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
      is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on
      our
      audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
      material respects, the consolidated financial position of Archer Daniels Midland
      Company at June 30, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its
      operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
      June 30, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
      Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
      in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
      in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As
      discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007 Archer
      Daniels Midland Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      Number 158 related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement
      plans.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Archer Daniels Midland
      Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, based
      on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission,
      and our report dated August 24, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion
      thereon.

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

Archer
      Daniels Midland Company

Decatur,
      Illinois

We
      have
      audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,

that Archer Daniels
      Midland Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
      as of June 30, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
      the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Archer Daniels Midland Company’s
      management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
      financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
      control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
      on
      management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
      internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements.

Because
      of
      its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
      our
      opinion, management’s assessment that Archer Daniels Midland Company maintained
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, is
      fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also,
      in
      our opinion, Archer Daniels Midland Company maintained, in all material
      respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
      2007, based on

the COSO
      criteria

.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Archer
      Daniels Midland Company as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, and the related
      consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for
      each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2007, of Archer Daniels
      Midland Company, and our report dated August 24, 2007, expressed an unqualified
      opinion thereon.

CONTROLS
                AND PROCEDURES

As
      of June
      30, 2007, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
      participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
      and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
      of
      the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules
      13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
      Act)).  Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including
      the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the Company’s
      disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information
      required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
      under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
      within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules
      and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO to allow
      timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  There was no change
      in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the Company’s
      most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
      reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over
      financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
      REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Archer
      Daniels Midland Company’s (“ADM”) management is responsible for establishing and
      maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
      is
      defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  ADM’s internal control
      system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
      of
      financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles.

Under
      the
      supervision and with the participation of management, including its principal
      executive officer and principal financial officer, ADM’s management assessed the
      design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
      as of June 30, 2007 based on the framework set forth in

Internal
      Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
      Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based
      on
      this assessment, management concluded that ADM’s internal control over financial
      reporting was effective as of June 30, 2007.  Ernst & Young LLP,
      an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
      report on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over
      financial reporting as of June 30, 2007.  That report is included
      herein.
