PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

Company Overview

Archer-Daniels-Midland-Company (the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in 1923, successor to the Daniels Linseed Co. founded in 1902.  The Company is one of the world’s largest processors of oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa, and other agricultural commodities and is a leading manufacturer of vegetable oil, protein meal, corn sweeteners, flour, biodiesel, ethanol, and other value-added food and feed ingredients.  The Company also has an extensive grain elevator and transportation network to procure, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, and barley, as well as processed agricultural commodities.  The Company has significant investments in joint ventures.  The Company expects to benefit from these investments, which typically aim to expand or enhance the Company’s market for its products or offer other benefits including, but not limited to, geographic or product line expansion.

The Company’s vision is to be the most admired global agribusiness while creating value and growing responsibly.  The Company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops that it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio.  The Company seeks to serve vital needs by connecting the harvest to the home and transforming crops into food and energy products.  The Company desires to execute this vision and these strategies by conducting its business in accordance with its core values of operating with integrity, treating others with respect, achieving excellence, being resourceful, displaying teamwork, and being responsible.

During the past five years, the Company significantly expanded its agricultural commodity processing and handling capacity through construction of new plants, expansion of existing plants, and the acquisition of plants and transportation equipment.  The Company currently expects to spend approximately $2.0 billion on capital expenditures in fiscal year 2012, primarily for acquisitions and expansions of processing plants as well as for storage facilities, transportation equipment, and other capital projects including projects aimed at improving efficiency.  The Company anticipates that approximately one-half of these investments will relate to non-U.S. operations and a significant portion of the U.S. investments will support the Company’s ability to serve export markets.  There have been no significant dispositions during the last five years.

Segment Descriptions

The Company’s operations are classified into three reportable business segments: Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing, and Agricultural Services.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations, which include wheat processing, cocoa processing, and its financial business units, are not reportable business segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.  Financial information with respect to the Company’s reportable business segments is set forth in Note 16 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 herein, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Item 1.

Item 1.

BUSINESS (Continued)

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

Substantially all of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities.  In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  The Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis.  The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials.

Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses

The Company owns valuable patents, trademarks, and licenses but does not consider any segment of its business dependent upon any single or group of patents, trademarks or licenses.

Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers

Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in the manufacture, sale, and distribution of its products and services.  There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa beans, sugarcane, and other grains.  However, the physical movement of the millions of metric tons of these crops through the Company’s global processing facilities is reasonably constant throughout the year.

The Company’s working capital requirements are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.  Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the fall harvest and are generally lower during the summer months.  Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.  No material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.  The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world.  Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.

Competition

The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, quality, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company.  Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset portfolio.

Research and Development Expenditures

The Company’s research and development expenditures are focused on responding to demand from customers’ product development or formulation needs, improving processing efficiency, and developing food, feed, fuel, and industrial products from renewable agricultural crops.  Research and development expense during the three years ended June 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009, net of reimbursements of government grants, was approximately $60 million, $56 million, and $50 million, respectively.  The Company does not expect these research and development expenses to have a significant effect on net sales and other operating profit in the next year.

Item 1.

BUSINESS (Continued)

The Company is working with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory and other key academic and corporate partners on projects to demonstrate carbon capture and sequestration as a viable option for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing operations.  The first project, Illinois Basin Decatur Project (IBDP) led by Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium (MGSC), has finished construction and expects to start operations in the third quarter of calendar year 2011.  The second project, the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture & Sequestration (IL-ICCS), has met the milestone for completing the front end engineering designs and commenced construction in the second quarter of calendar year 2011. This facility is expected to be operational in the third quarter of calendar year 2013.

The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of industrial chemicals with an objective to produce  key chemical building blocks that serve as a platform for producing a variety of commodity chemicals.  The key chemical building blocks are derived from the Company’s starch and oilseed-based feedstocks.  Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both fermentation and catalysis.  The chemicals pipeline includes the development of chemicals and intermediates that are currently produced from petrochemical resources as well as new to the market bio-based products. The Company’s current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration. In an effort to further advance the development of bio-based chemical technologies, the Company has partnered with the Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis (CEBC) at Kansas University.  The Company and Kansas University were awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in May 2011 to develop sustainable catalytic processes to convert biomass into bio-based chemicals.

Environmental Compliance

During the year ended June 30, 2011, $91 million was spent specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.

On July 31, 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) issued a Notice of Violation indicating that one of the Company’s facilities in Memphis, Tennessee, may have violated section 311(j) of the Clean Water Act relating to a release of product that occurred on January 2, 2008.  The Company and the U.S. EPA have reached an agreement to resolve this matter with the payment of a penalty of approximately $120,000.

There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with federal, state, and local laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.

The Company’s business could be affected in the future by national and global regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, the U.S. EPA has adopted regulations requiring the owners of certain facilities to measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions, and the U.S. EPA has begun a process to regulate these emissions under the Clean Air Act.  Globally, a number of countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol have instituted or are considering climate change legislation and regulations. Most notable is the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System (EU-ETS). The Company has several facilities in Europe that participate in this system.  It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment.

Number of Employees

The number of full-time employees of the Company was approximately 30,700 at June 30, 2011.

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the Company procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises can be affected by weather conditions, disease, government programs, competition, and various other factors beyond the Company’s control and could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions, disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  These factors have historically caused volatility in agricultural commodity prices and, consequently, in the Company’s operating results.  Reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weather-related factors or other reasons could adversely affect the Company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limit the Company’s ability to procure, transport, store, process, and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner.

The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates.

The Company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors.  The Company is dependent on being able to generate net sales and other operating income in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins, profits, and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures and provide cash for operating, working capital, dividend, or capital expenditure needs.  Competition impacts the Company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors.  Pricing of the Company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring on-line idled capacity or build new production capacity.  Many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities.  The markets for global commodities are highly price competitive and in many cases the commodities are subject to substitution.  To compete effectively, the Company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market share, and providing high levels of customer service.  Competition could increase the Company’s costs to purchase raw materials, lower selling prices of its products, or reduce the Company’s market share, which may result in lower and more inefficient operating rates and reduced gross profit.

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

Fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices.  The Company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity, natural gas, and coal.  The Company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.  Significant increases in the cost of these items, including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases, could adversely affect the Company’s production costs and operating results.

The Company has certain finished products, such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products.  Therefore, the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline and diesel fuel.  A significant decrease in the price of gasoline or diesel fuel could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the Company’s ethanol and biodiesel and could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.

The Company is subject to economic downturns, political instability and other risks of doing business globally which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas. The Company’s operations are principally in the United States and developed countries in Western Europe and South America, but the Company also operates in, or plans to expand or develop its business in, emerging market areas such as Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns, including decreased demand for the Company’s products, reduced availability of credit, or declining credit quality of the Company’s suppliers, customers, and other counterparties.  In addition, emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile economic, political and market conditions.  Economic downturns and volatile conditions could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and ability to execute its business strategies.

The Company’s operating results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary, fiscal and environmental policies, laws, and regulations, and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations.  These conditions include but are not limited to changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions, trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency exchange fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, enforceability of legal agreements and judgments, trade barriers, adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes, and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases.  International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the Company’s ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.

Government policies and regulations, in general, and government policy and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries, could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

Agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, renewable fuel, and low carbon fuel mandates, can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, the volume and types of imports and exports, the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials, the viability and volume of production of certain of the Company’s products, and industry profitability.  In addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Company’s products, restrict the Company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets, and could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.

The Company is subject to industry-specific risks which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company is subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, product quality or contamination; shifting consumer preferences; federal, state, and local food processing regulations; socially unacceptable farming practices; environmental, health and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims.  The liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the Company.  The occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.

Certain of the Company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.  The Company is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry.  An outbreak of disease could adversely affect demand for the Company’s products used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.  A decrease in demand for these products could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.

The Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations globally which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in over 75 countries.  In addition, the Company distributes product to countries in which we do not operate facilities.  The Company is required to comply with the numerous and broad-reaching laws and regulations administered by United States federal, state and local, and foreign governmental authorities.  The Company must comply with other general business regulations such as those directed toward accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, handling of regulated substances, and other commercial activities, conducted by the Company’s employees and third party representatives globally.  Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, and civil remedies including fines, injunctions, and recalls of its products.

The production of the Company’s products requires the use of materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances, including greenhouse gas emissions.  Although the Company has programs in place throughout the organization globally to guard against non-compliance, failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties as well as a negative impact on the Company’s reputation, business, cash flows, and results of operations.

In addition, changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations, for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases, may require the Company to modify existing processing facilities and/or processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results.

The Company is exposed to potential business disruption, including but not limited to disruption of transportation services, supply of non-commodity raw materials used in its processing operations, and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, and accidents which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services.  A disruption in transportation services could result in difficulties supplying materials to the Company’s facilities and impair the Company’s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner.  In addition, if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials, such as certain chemicals used in the Company’s processing operations, are not available, the Company’s business could be disrupted.  Certain factors which may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Company’s control including, but not limited to, disruptions resulting from economic conditions, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of materials, and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions.

The assets and operations of the Company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, and fires. The potential effects of these conditions could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

The Company’s business is capital intensive in nature and the Company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs.  Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company requires significant capital to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy.  The Company’s working capital requirements are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.  The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations and changing safety standards in the industry.  Moreover, the expansion of the Company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital.  If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it may restrict the Company’s current operations and its growth opportunities which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company’s risk management strategies may not be effective.

The Company’s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company engages in strategies to manage these risks.  However, these strategies may not be successful in mitigating the Company’s exposure to these fluctuations.  See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

The Company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures.

The Company has $3.2 billion invested in or advanced to joint ventures and investments which the Company has limited control as to the governance and management activities of these investments.  Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during 2011 was $7.1 billion.  The Company faces certain risks, including risks related to the financial strength of the investment partner, loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit, the inability to implement beneficial management strategies, including risk management and compliance monitoring, with respect to the investment’s activities, and the risk that the Company may not be able resolve disputes with the investment partner.  The Company may encounter unanticipated operating issues or financial results related to these investments that may impact the Company’s revenues and operating results.

The Company’s information technology systems, processes, and sites may suffer interruptions or failures which may affect the Company’s ability to conduct its business.

The Company’s information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, provide critical data connectivity, information and services for internal and external users.  These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting raw materials to finished products, inventory management, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business.  The Company has put in place disaster recovery plans for its critical systems.  However, if the Company’s information technology systems are damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Company’s disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in the ability to manage its operations, which may adversely impact the Company’s revenues, operating results, and financial condition.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Company Overview

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  The Company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in more than 75 countries.  The Company also processes corn, oilseeds, wheat and cocoa into products for food, animal feed, chemical and energy uses.  The Company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to generate returns for our shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities.

The Company’s operations are organized, managed and classified into three reportable business segments: Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing, and Agricultural Services.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations, which include wheat processing, cocoa processing, and its financial business units, are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.

The Oilseeds Processing segment includes activities related to the origination, merchandising, crushing, and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable oils and protein meals.  Oilseeds products produced and marketed by the Company include ingredients for the food, feed, energy, and other industrial products industries.  Crude vegetable oils produced by the segment’s crushing activities are sold “as is” or are further processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.  Salad oils are sold “as is” or are further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products.  Oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds.  The Oilseeds Processing segment also produces natural health and nutrition products and other specialty food and feed ingredients.  In North America, cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the pharmaceutical industry and cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and filter markets.  In Europe and South America, the Oilseeds Processing segment includes origination and merchandising activities of a network of grain elevators, port facilities, and transportation assets used to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, as adjuncts to its oilseeds processing assets.  In South America, the Oilseeds Processing segment operates fertilizer blending facilities.  Effective December 31, 2010, the Company acquired Alimenta (USA) Inc., and as a result of the transaction, now owns 100% of Golden Peanut, the leading U.S. peanut sheller and oil refiner and operator of one peanut shelling facility in Argentina.  The Oilseeds Processing segment began consolidating the operating results of Golden Peanut, its previously 50% owned joint venture, in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.  The Oilseeds Processing segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity investment in Wilmar and its share of results for its Edible Oils Limited and Stratas Foods, LLC joint ventures.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The Company’s Corn Processing segment is engaged in corn wet milling and dry milling activities, with its asset base primarily located in the central part of the United States.  The Corn Processing segment converts corn into sweeteners and starches, and bioproducts.  Its products include ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, starch, syrup, glucose, and dextrose.  Dextrose and starch are used by the Corn Processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations.  By fermentation of dextrose, the Corn Processing segment produces alcohol, amino acids, and other specialty food and animal feed ingredients.  Ethyl alcohol is produced by the Company for industrial use as ethanol or as beverage grade.  Ethanol, in gasoline, increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate.  Bioproducts also include amino acids such as lysine and threonine that are vital compounds used in swine feeds to produce leaner animals and in poultry feeds to enhance the speed and efficiency of poultry production.  Corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers’ grains, are produced for use as animal feed ingredients.  Corn germ, a by-product of the wet milling process, is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal.  Other Corn Processing products include citric and lactic acids, lactates, sorbitol, xanthan gum, and glycols which are used in various food and industrial products.  The Corn Processing segment includes the activities of the Company’s Brazilian sugarcane operations, propylene and ethylene glycol facility, a bioplastic facility, and other equity investments in renewable plastics.  This segment includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity investments in Almidones Mexicanos S.A., Eaststarch C.V., and Red Star Yeast Company LLC.

The Agricultural Services segment utilizes its extensive U.S. grain elevator and global transportation network to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.  Agricultural Services’ grain sourcing and transportation network provides reliable and efficient services to the Company’s customers and agricultural processing operations. Agricultural Services’ transportation network capabilities include truck, rail, barge, port, and ocean-going vessel handling and freight services.  The Agricultural Services segment includes the activities of Alfred C. Toepfer International, an 80% owned global merchant of agricultural commodities and processed products.  The Agricultural Services segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its Kalama Export Company joint venture, activities related to the processing and distributing of formula feeds and animal health and nutrition products, and the procuring, processing, and distributing of edible beans.

Other includes the Company’s remaining processing operations, consisting of activities related to processing agricultural commodities into food ingredient products such as wheat into wheat flour, and cocoa into chocolate and cocoa products.  Other also includes financial activities related to banking, captive insurance, futures commission merchant activities, private equity fund investments, and the Company’s share of the results of its equity investment in Gruma S.A.B de C.V.

Corporate results principally include the impact of LIFO-related inventory adjustments, unallocated corporate expenses, unallocated net interest costs, and the after-tax elimination of income attributable to mandatorily redeemable interests in consolidated subsidiaries.

Operating Performance Indicators

The Company’s oilseeds processing, agricultural services, and wheat processing operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials.  Therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both net sales and other operating income and cost of products sold.  Thus, changes in margins and gross profit of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in net sales and other operating income amounts.

The Company’s corn processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials.  In these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes can result in significant fluctuations in cost of products sold, and such price changes cannot necessarily be passed directly through to the selling price of the finished products.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The Company conducts its business in over 75 countries.  For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency.  Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods.  For the majority of the Company’s business activities in Brazil, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, however certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar can result in corresponding fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the Company.

The Company measures the performance of its business segments using key financial metrics such as segment operating profit, return on invested capital, and cost per metric ton.  The Company’s operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings,  government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company does not provide forward-looking information in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

2011 Compared to 2010

As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company’s operating results.  In 2011, prices for certain agricultural commodities were higher in response to growing global demand and tighter crop supplies.  The projections of lower 2011 carryover stocks for certain key commodities, coupled with regional crop supply dislocations for certain commodities, also led to high commodity price volatility.  Global demand for agricultural commodities grew in 2011, resulting in increased sales volumes for most of the Company’s products.  The large 2010 North American harvest resulted in global merchandising, handling, and processing opportunities.  Protein meal markets for commercial livestock producers in the U.S., particularly poultry producers, faced challenging conditions.  Biodiesel markets in Europe and South America, together with the 2011 extension of the U.S. biodiesel blender’s credit, helped support global demand for refined and crude vegetable oils.  Sweeteners and starches demand remained strong in 2011 due primarily to U.S. exports of sweeteners and improved demand for industrial starches.  Ethanol sales volumes, including increased volumes as the Company’s new dry mills ramped up, were supported by favorable gasoline blending economics in the U.S. and good export demand.

Net earnings increased $106 million to $2.0 billion due principally to a $782 million increase in segment operating profit partially offset by a negative impact from changing LIFO inventory valuations and higher income taxes.  In 2011, the Company successfully managed through significant increases in market prices for most of its agricultural commodity raw materials, resulting in increased segment operating profit.  Earnings before income taxes includes charges of $368 million from the effect of increasing agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to credits of $42 million in the prior year caused by decreasing agricultural commodity prices.  Income taxes increased $331 million due to a higher effective income tax rate and higher earnings before income taxes.  The effective income tax rate of 33.1% for 2011 was the result of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and unfavorable specific tax items.

The fully diluted earnings per share calculation for 2011 was impacted by the completion of the Company’s debt remarketing related to the $1.75 billion Equity Units.  While the approximately 44 million new common shares related to the $1.75 billion Equity Units were not issued until June 1, 2011, the “if converted” method of accounting for diluted earnings per share required diluted EPS to be calculated as if the Company issued the shares on January 1, 2011, and this assumption resulted in a dilutive impact of $0.04 on earnings per share (See Note 9 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

Net sales and other operating income increased $19.0 billion, or 31%, to $80.7 billion.  Net sales and other operating income increased $14.2 billion due to higher average selling prices, primarily related to higher underlying commodity costs, and increased $4.8 billion due to increased sales volumes, including sales volumes from acquisitions.  Agricultural Services sales increased 42% to $37.9 billion due to higher average selling prices of agricultural commodities and higher global sales volumes.  Oilseeds Processing sales increased 22% to $26.7 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices for vegetable oils, soybeans, biodiesel, and protein meal.  Corn Processing sales increased 26% to $9.9 billion due to higher average selling prices and increased sales volumes of ethanol and other corn products, in part due to the Company’s two new ethanol dry mills coming on-line.  Other sales increased 18% to $6.2 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of cocoa and cocoa products and wheat flour; and increased sales volumes of cocoa and cocoa products.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Cost of products sold increased 32% to $76.4 billion due to higher costs of agricultural commodities, negative impacts resulting from changes in LIFO inventory valuations, and higher manufacturing costs.   Cost of products sold includes charges of $368 million from the effect of increasing agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to credits of $42 million in the prior year caused by decreasing agricultural commodity prices.  Manufacturing expenses increased $410 million due primarily to higher processed volumes, including the volumes of the Company’s new greenfield operations coming on-line, and higher average unit costs for certain chemicals and fuels used in the Company’s processing and transportation operations.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company updated its estimates for service lives of certain of its machinery and equipment assets.  This change in estimate resulted in a $133 million decrease in depreciation expense compared to the amount of depreciation expense the Company would have recorded using the previously estimated service lives.  Manufacturing expenses included $94 million in fiscal 2011 related to the start up of new plants compared to $110 million in the prior year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15% to $1.6 billion.  This increase was due to higher employee-related costs and higher administrative expenses.  Higher employee-related costs principally reflect the increase in number of employees during the year and included higher salaries and wages, higher accruals for performance-based compensation and higher benefit expenses.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates declined 3% to $542 million.  The decline in earnings from the Company’s equity investee, Wilmar, were partially offset by higher earnings of the Company’s equity investee, Gruma, in part due to a gain on disposition of assets.

Interest income increased 8% to $136 million principally resulting from higher interest earned on advances to affiliates.

Interest expense increased 14% to $482 million.  Interest costs capitalized as a component of major construction projects in progress was $7 million compared to $75 million in the prior year.  Interest incurred on long-term debt declined $24 million as a result of debt retirements while interest incurred on short-term debt increased $15 million due to higher average borrowings driven by higher working capital requirements.

Other (income) expense – net increased $255 million primarily due to the $71 million gain resulting from the revaluation of the Company’s previously held equity interest in Golden Peanut upon acquisition of the remaining 50% interest, gains on interest rate swaps of $30 million compared to a loss of $59 million in the prior year, and a decrease in charges related to early extinguishment of debt from $75 million in the prior year to $15 million in the current year.

Income taxes increased $331 million to $997 million due to a higher effective income tax rate and higher pretax earnings.  The Company’s effective income tax rate increased to 33.1% during 2011 compared to 25.8% in fiscal 2010.  The increase in the current year rate is primarily due to a geographic mix of earnings that shifted more to the U.S., a higher U.S. effective income tax rate, income tax expense associated with foreign currency re-measurement of non-monetary assets in Brazil, and adjustments to deferred income tax balances.

Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 9% to $1.5 billion.  Crushing and origination results increased $195 million to $1.0 billion, which include the $71 million gain on the revaluation of the Company’s equity interest in Golden Peanut as a result of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest.  Improved North American crushing results, particularly for cotton seed and canola, were partially offset by lower crushing margins in South America and Europe.  Margins globally were enhanced by good positioning and by improved origination results.  In South America, fertilizer results improved due to higher margins and volumes.  Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $38 million to $329 million due principally to higher packaged oils margins and improved North American and European biodiesel results.  Asia results decreased $109 million due principally to decreased earnings from the Company’s equity investee, Wilmar.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Corn Processing operating profit increased 47% to $1.1 billion, which includes favorable impacts from ownership positions, which were allocated to sweeteners and starches and bioproducts based on total grind.  Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $209 million to $320 million due to higher net corn costs partially offset by higher sales volumes.  Sales volumes increased due to U.S. export shipments of sweeteners and improved U.S. demand for industrial starches. Bioproducts operating profit improved $549 million primarily due to higher ethanol sales volumes and higher average selling prices leading to increased ethanol and lysine margins.  Bioproducts margins were also enhanced by favorable corn ownership positions.  Bioproducts results included startup costs related to the Company’s new plants of $94 million in the current year compared to $107 million in the prior year.

Agricultural Services operating profit increased 38% to $922 million.  Merchandising and handling results increased due to higher corn and wheat sales volumes and higher margins.  A large 2010 U.S. harvest combined with strong international demand resulted in higher U.S. export shipments.  Merchandising and handling results this year include an insurance recovery of $67 million related to property damage and business interruption resulting from an October 2008 explosion at the Company’s Destrehan, Louisiana export facility.  International merchandising results were weaker in part due to positions impacted by unexpected shifts in crop supply caused by weather conditions and government actions in the Black Sea region.  Transportation results increased $19 million to $104 million primarily due to higher barge freight rates and higher barge utilization levels, in part due to higher U.S. export volumes.

Other operating profit increased 14% to $513 million.  Other processing operating results improved in the Company’s wheat milling and cocoa business units due principally to increased equity earnings from the Company’s equity investee, Gruma, which include a $78 million gain related to the disposal of Gruma assets.    Other financial operating profit decreased $7 million primarily due to higher captive insurance loss provisions principally related to a $67 million loss related to the Company’s Destrehan, Louisiana export facility insurance claim.

Corporate results decreased $352 million primarily due to the negative impact from changing LIFO inventory valuations and higher unallocated interest expense - net.  The effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory reserves resulted in charges of $368 million compared to credits of $42 million for the prior year.  Corporate unallocated interest expense increased $52 million mostly due to lower capitalization of interest costs for construction projects in progress.  Partially offsetting the higher LIFO and unallocated interest costs were $30 million of gains on interest rate swaps compared to prior year losses on interest rate swaps of $59 million.  In addition, the prior year included charges of $75 million on early debt extinguishment compared to $8 million of similar charges in the current year.

2010 Compared to 2009

As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company’s operating results.  Market expectations throughout most of fiscal 2010 for fewer global crop supply and demand imbalances, coupled with continuing uncertainty about short-term demand, led to generally lower and less volatile agricultural commodity market prices and conditions.  In addition, the late, extended U.S. harvest reduced profit opportunities.  North American oilseed exports and U.S. crushing volumes were enhanced in 2010 by the poor supply of 2009 crop year soybeans in South America.  Increased government mandates for the use of biodiesel in South America and Europe resulted in increased biodiesel demand and helped keep overall demand for refined and crude vegetable oil steady in these regions.  However, in North America, demand for vegetable oils remained weak in 2010 due to low consumption of oils in the food service and biodiesel industries, in part due to the expiration of the biodiesel blending credit in the U.S. on January 1, 2010.  Soybean protein meal demand improved, particularly in Asia.  Market prices for corn decreased in 2010 resulting in lower raw material costs for corn processing and decreased average selling prices for sweeteners and starches.  Lower energy, fuel and chemical costs per unit positively impacted the Company’s manufacturing costs.  More favorable ethanol blending economics together with increased ethanol merchandising activity resulted in increased demand, higher ethanol sales volumes, and improved margins.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Earnings before income taxes for 2010 include a credit of $42 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a credit of $517 million in 2009.

Income taxes decreased $146 million due to a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher pretax earnings.  Income taxes for 2009 included a $158 million charge resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar.

Net sales and other operating income decreased 11% to $61.7 billion due principally to lower average selling prices in 2010 in line with year-over-year declines in underlying commodity costs.  Oilseeds Processing sales decreased 9% to $21.8 billion, due principally to lower average selling prices for soybeans, protein meal, refined oil, and biodiesel partially offset by increased sales volumes of soybeans and fertilizer.  Corn Processing sales increased 3% to $7.9 billion primarily as a result of increased sales volumes of ethanol and lysine partially offset by lower average selling prices of ethanol, sweeteners, and starches.  Agricultural Services sales decreased 17% to $26.8 billion, due to lower average selling prices, in line with year-over-year declines in underlying commodity prices and lower sales volumes.  Other sales decreased 3% to $5.2 billion, primarily due to lower average selling prices of wheat flour partially offset by increased wheat flour sales volumes and higher average selling prices and sales volumes for cocoa products.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Cost of products sold decreased 11% to $57.8 billion, due principally to decreased agricultural commodity costs including the impact of changes in LIFO inventory valuations which reduced cost of products sold by $42 million in 2010 compared to $517 million in 2009.  Manufacturing expenses decreased 1% or $60 million, primarily due to lower energy, chemical and fuel costs partially offset by higher employee-related costs and a $124 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.  In 2010, manufacturing expenses included additional costs associated with the Company’s new greenfield plants.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% to $1.4 billion, due principally to decreased provisions for doubtful accounts partially offset by increased expenses for legal, professional, and commercial services.

Equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $416 million to $561 million primarily due to the absence of a non-cash charge of $275 million in 2009 related to currency derivative losses of the Company’s equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V.

Interest income declined $55 million to $126 million primarily due to lower average interest rates.

Interest expense declined $47 million to $422 million primarily due to lower average interest rates.

Other expense – net increased $91 million due to pre-tax charges of $75 million related to the early extinguishment of debt and $59 million for unrealized losses on interest rate swaps (for more information on the charges related to the early extinguishment of debt, see Note 8 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

Income taxes decreased $146 million due to a lower effective income tax rate partially offset by higher pretax earnings.  The Company’s effective income tax rate during 2010 was 25.8%.  In 2009, the effective income tax rate was 32.5% which included $158 million of income tax charges related to the partial restructuring of the holding company structure through which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar.  Excluding these Wilmar charges, the Company’s effective income tax rate for 2009 was 26.2%.  For more information concerning Wilmar tax matters see Note 13 in Item 8.

Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 9% to $1.4 billion.  Crushing and origination results increased $51 million due to higher North American soybean crushing margins and favorable soft seed commodity positioning, partially offset by lower soybean crushing margins in Europe and South America.  Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other operating profit increased $26 million due primarily to higher South American biodiesel results and improved margins in Europe.  Oilseeds processing results in Asia increased $43 million to $291 million due principally to improved equity earnings of Wilmar.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Corn Processing operating profit increased $537 million to $722 million.  Bioproducts operating profit increased $508 million due to improved ethanol and lysine sales volumes and improved ethanol margins resulting from lower net corn costs and decreased manufacturing costs.  Ethanol sales volumes increased due to favorable gasoline blending economics and increased merchandising activity.  Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $29 million due to lower net corn and manufacturing costs due principally to lower energy and chemical prices.  These lower manufacturing costs were partially offset by lower average selling prices.

Agricultural Services operating profit decreased $326 million to $668 million.  Merchandising and handling results decreased $249 million.  Enhanced volume and margin opportunities created by 2009’s volatile commodity markets and tight credit markets did not recur.  Volumes and margins in 2010 benefited from strong demand for U.S. soybean exports following the short South American 2009 crop.  Transportation results decreased $77 million due to lower barge freight rates and decreased barge utilization levels resulting from weaker U.S. economic conditions and the late, extended North American harvest.

Other operating profit increased $455 million to $449 million.  Other processing operating profit increased $352 million due to improved equity earnings from the Company’s investment in Gruma, improved wheat milling margins, and improved cocoa processing results.  Financial operating profit increased $103 million due primarily to the absence of losses experienced in 2009 from managed fund investments and captive insurance operations.

Corporate results decreased $701 million.  The effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations resulted in a credit of $42 million for the year ended June 30, 2010, compared to a credit of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009.  Unallocated interest expense – net increased $91 million reflecting a reduction in corporate interest income caused by lower short-term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments.  In March 2010, the Company repurchased $500 million of long-term debt which generated a $75 million pretax charge on early extinguishment of debt.  In connection with a debt remarketing planned for 2011, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on a portion of the planned remarketing which resulted in $59 million of unrealized losses on interest rate swaps.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  The primary source of funds to finance the Company’s operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations.  In addition, the Company maintains a commercial paper borrowing facility and has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both U.S. and international markets.

At June 30, 2011, the Company had $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.1 to 1.  Included in working capital is $7.1 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  Cash used in operating activities was $2.3 billion for the year compared to cash provided by operating activities of $2.7 billion last year.  Working capital increased in the current year due principally to higher agricultural commodity market prices.  Cash used in investing activities of $1.7 billion, principally for capital expenditures, businesses acquired, and investments, was in line with last year.  Cash provided by financing activities was $3.6 billion for the year compared to cash used in financing activities of $1.0 billion last year.  Net borrowings increased primarily to fund higher working capital.  Short-term borrowings increased due principally to higher commercial paper borrowings, and long-term borrowings increased primarily as a result of the issuance of $1.5 billion of 18-month floating rate notes in February 2011.  In addition, the Company issued common stock and received $1.75 billion under the forward stock purchase component of the Company’s Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8).

At June 30, 2011, the Company’s capital resources included net worth of $18.8 billion and lines of credit totaling $6.9 billion, of which $5.7 billion was unused.  The Company’s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of the Company’s long-term debt and shareholders’ equity) was 30% at June 30, 2011 and 32% at June 30, 2010.  This ratio is a measure of the Company’s long-term indebtedness and is an indicator of financial flexibility.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $4.6 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were $620 million of commercial paper outstanding at June 30, 2011.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes.  As of June 30, 2011, none of the conditions permitting conversion of these notes had been satisfied.  The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes.  As of June 30, 2011, the market price of the Company’s common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes.

On July 1, 2011, the Company entered into a 364-day accounts receivable securitization facility.  The facility provides the Company with up to $1.0 billion in liquidity.  Under the facility, the Company’s U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity which then sells an undivided interest in the receivable as a collateral for any borrowings under the facility.  Any borrowings under the facility will be recorded as secured borrowings.  As of August 24, 2011, the Company had not used the facility.  This facility expands the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets.

The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of June 30, 2011.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future.  The following table sets forth the Company’s significant future obligations by time period.  Purchases include commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” energy-related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Company’s normal business activities.  The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $79 million as of June 30, 2011 as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement.  Where applicable, information included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes is cross-referenced in this table.

(1)

Includes pension contributions of $47 million for fiscal 2012.  The Company is unable to estimate the amount of pension contributions beyond fiscal year 2012.  For more information concerning the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans, see Note 15 in Item 8.

At June 30, 2011, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $2.8 billion through calendar year 2014 to complete currently approved capital projects which are not included in the table above.  The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $620 million at June 30, 2011.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments.  The Company’s liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation.  The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.  At June 30, 2011, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $121 million.  Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $69 million at June 30, 2011.

Critical Accounting Policies

The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Company’s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  These estimates and judgments are based on the Company’s historical experience and management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Certain of the Company’s accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Company’s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  Management has discussed with the Company’s Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.  Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Company’s financial statements.

Inventories and Derivatives

Certain of the Company’s merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed-price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values.  These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.  Management estimates market value based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.  Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.

The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Company’s anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol.  The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.  If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  See Note 4 in Item 8 for additional information.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits.

Eligible U.S. employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan.  Eligible U.S. employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a “cash balance” pension formula.

The Company provides eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are “grandfathered” into subsidized coverage).

In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.  These estimates and assumptions are based on the Company’s historical experience combined with management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.  If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.  See Note 15 in Item 8 for additional information.

Income Taxes

The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.  As an example, a subsidiary of the Company received tax assessments in the amount of $665 million consisting of  tax, penalty, and interest (adjusted for interest and variation in currency exchange rates) from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service challenging the deductibility of commodity hedging losses incurred by the Company for tax years 2004, 2006 and 2007.  The Company evaluated its tax position regarding these hedging transactions and concluded, based in part upon advice from Brazilian legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these deductions (See Note 13 in Item 8 for additional information).

Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Company’s income statement.  The realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  The Company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.   Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and the Company’s share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately $8.2 billion at June 30, 2011, are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon.  If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs

The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  This business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.  Both the availability of the Company’s raw materials and the demand for the Company’s finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Company’s raw materials and finished products.  Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Company’s assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories.  The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.  These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.  Management evaluates the Company’s property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

The Company accounts for its goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

.  Under this standard, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.

Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates

The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available-for-sale and carries these securities at fair value.  The Company applies the equity method for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence.  These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Company’s investments is readily available based on quoted market prices.  For non-publicly traded securities, management’s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds.  In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary.  In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Company’s ability and intent to hold the investment.  When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 in Item 8 for information regarding the Company’s marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The market risk inherent in the Company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Company’s net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below.

Commodities

The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions, disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.

The Company enters into derivative and non-derivative contracts with the primary objective of managing the Company’s exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used for, and produced in, our business operations.    The Company will also use exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.

The Company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sales contracts, energy and freight contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements, net of sales.

The fair value of the Company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period, where available, or utilizing a close proxy.  The Company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure, which consist of volumetric limits, and value-at-risk (VaR) limits.  VaR measures the potential loss, at a 95% confidence level, that could be incurred over a one year period.  Volumetric limits are monitored daily and VaR calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly.

In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming no correlations) over a one year period using VaR, sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices.  The highest, lowest, and average weekly position for each of the last two years together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10% adverse price change is as follows:

The change in fair value of the average position for 2011 compared to 2010 was principally the result of changes in average quantities underlying the weekly commodity position.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued)

Currencies

The Company conducts its business in over 75 countries.  For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency.  To reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real currencies.  These currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur.  The Company does not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.  The currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange-traded futures contracts, and over-the-counter options.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material.

The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year-end exchange rates is $8.2 billion at June 30, 2011, and $6.4 billion at June 30, 2010.  This increase is due to the appreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar and an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.  The potential loss in fair value, which would principally be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income, resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $837 million and $639 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Actual results may differ.

Interest

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long-term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates.  Actual results may differ.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business

The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2011, and for the three years then ended include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  Investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  The Company’s portion of the results of certain affiliates and results of certain majority-owned subsidiaries are included using the most recent available financial statements.  In each case, the financial statements are within 93 days of the Company’s year end and are consistent from period to period, except as described below.

The Company evaluates and consolidates, where appropriate, its less than majority-owned investments pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810,

Consolidation

.

Effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, one of the Company’s majority-owned subsidiaries changed its accounting period resulting in the elimination of a one-month lag in the reporting of the consolidated subsidiary’s financial results.  The effect of this change on after-tax earnings for the year ended June 30, 2011 was immaterial.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company updated its estimates for service lives of certain of its machinery and equipment assets in order to better match the Company’s depreciation expense with the periods these assets are expected to generate revenue based on planned and historical service periods.  The new estimated service lives were established based on manufacturing engineering data, external benchmark data and on new information obtained as a result of the Company’s recent major construction projects.  These new estimated service lives are also supported by biofuels legislation and mandates in many countries that are driving requirements over time for greater future usage and higher blend rates of biofuels.

The Company accounted for this service life update as a change in accounting estimate as of October 1, 2010 in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 250,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

, thereby impacting the quarter in which the change occurred and future quarters.  The effect of this change on after-tax earnings and diluted earnings per share was an increase of $83 million and $0.13, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2011.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Reclassifications

Other (income) expense - net in prior years’ consolidated statement of earnings has been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation with corresponding changes to certain items in prior year’s Note 4.  In addition, inventories and accrued expenses in prior year’s consolidated balance sheet have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation with corresponding changes in prior year’s consolidated statement of cash flows with no impact to total cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, or financing activities.  The consolidated balance sheet reclassification also resulted in changes to certain items in prior year’s Notes 4 and 16.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all non-segregated, highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Segregated Cash and Investments

The Company segregates certain cash and investment balances in accordance with certain regulatory requirements, commodity exchange requirements, and insurance arrangements.  These segregated balances represent deposits received from customers of the Company’s registered futures commission merchant, securities pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses, and cash and securities pledged as security under certain insurance arrangements.  Segregated cash and investments primarily consist of cash, United States government securities, and money-market funds.

Receivables

The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value.  This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts, $100 million and $97 million at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances.  The Company calculates this allowance based on its history of write-offs, level of past-due accounts, and its relationships with, and the economic status of, its customers.

Credit risk on receivables is minimized as a result of the large and diversified nature of the Company’s worldwide customer base.  The Company manages its exposure to counter-party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.  Collateral is generally not required for the Company’s receivables.  Accounts receivable due from unconsolidated affiliates as of June 30, 2011 and 2010 was $367 million and $304 million, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include inventories acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  In addition, the Company values certain inventories using the lower of cost, determined by either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods, or market.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Marketable Securities

The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale, except for certain designated securities which are classified as trading securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income.  The Company monitors its investments for impairment periodically, and recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of an investment is judged to be other-than-temporary.  Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in income on a current basis.  The Company uses the specific identification method when securities are sold or reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.  The Company considers marketable securities maturing in less than one year as short-term.  All other marketable securities are classified as long-term.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost.  Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company generally uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: buildings - 10 to 40 years; machinery and equipment - 3 to 30 years.  The Company capitalized interest on major construction projects in progress of $7 million, $75 million, and $95 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

The Company accounts for its goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC Topic 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

.  Under this standard, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  The Company recorded a $6 million goodwill impairment charge during 2009.  There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during 2011 and 2010.  The carrying value of the Company’s other intangible assets is not material.

Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs

The Company recorded a $2 million, a $9 million, and a $13 million charge in cost of products sold during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, principally related to the abandonment and write-down to fair value of certain long-lived assets.  The majority of these assets were idle or related to underperforming product lines and the decision to abandon or write-down was finalized after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose, employ the assets in alternative uses, or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  After the write-downs, the carrying value of these assets is immaterial.

Net Sales

The Company follows a policy of recognizing sales revenue at the time of delivery of the product and when all of the following have occurred: a sales agreement is in place, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.  Freight costs and handling charges related to sales are recorded as a component of cost of products sold.  Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $7.1 billion, $7.1 billion, and $6.5 billion, respectively.

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Stock Compensation

The Company recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted.  The Company’s share-based compensation plans provide for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock options.  The fair values of stock options and performance stock units are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and a lattice valuation model, respectively.  These valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions.  Measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award.

Research and Development

Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.  Such costs incurred, net of expenditures subsequently reimbursed by government grants, were $60 million, $56 million, and $50 million for the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Per Share Data

Basic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings attributable to controlling interests by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  In computing diluted earnings per share, average number of common shares outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise prices lower than the average market price of common shares using the treasury share method.

As further described in Note 8, certain potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the diluted average shares calculation because their impact was anti-dilutive, except during the third quarter of fiscal 2011.  See Note 9 for the earnings per share calculation

New Accounting Standards

Effective July 1, 2010, the Company adopted the amended guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810,

Consolidations

, which changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights (known as variable interest entities or VIEs) should be consolidated.  The determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on, among other things, the reporting entity’s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity’s economic performance and the other entity’s purpose and design.  The VIEs in which the Company holds variable interests are not considered material to the Company’s consolidated results. As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Company deconsolidated one VIE with no material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective October 1, 2010, the Company adopted the amended guidance in ASC Topic 310,

Receivables

, which requires more robust and disaggregated disclosures about the credit quality of an entity’s financing receivables (excluding trade receivables), and its allowances for credit losses.  The new disclosures require additional information for nonaccrual and past due accounts, the allowance for credit losses, impaired loans, credit quality, and account notifications.  A financing receivable is defined as a contractual right to receive money on demand or on fixed or determinable dates that is recognized as an asset in the entity’s statement of financial position.

The Company has seasonal interest-bearing inventory financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world.  Typically, advances occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.  As of June 30, 2011, $220 million of receivables under these financing arrangements were outstanding, the majority of which was secured by various forms of collateral.  Receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when the accounts are in legal dispute.  Interest income and losses on these inventory financing arrangements are not material.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hickory Point Bank and Trust, also has loans receivable.  As of June 30, 2011, $290 million of loans were outstanding.  The accrual of interest on these loans is discontinued when the loan is 90 days past due.  Interest income and losses on these bank loans are not material.

The Company’s other financing receivables as of June 30, 2011 were immaterial.

Effective July 1, 2011, the Company will be required to adopt the second phase of the amended guidance in ASC Topic 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,

which requires the Company to disclose information in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis, separately for assets and liabilities.  The adoption of this amended guidance will require expanded disclosure in the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements but will not impact financial results.

Effective July 1, 2012, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 220,

Comprehensive Income

, which requires the Company to present total comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.  The amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity.  The Company will be required to apply the presentation and disclosure requirements of the amended guidance retrospectively.  The adoption of this amended guidance will change financial statement presentation and require expanded disclosures in the Company’s consolidated financial statements but will not impact financial results.

Note 2.

Acquisitions

The Company’s 2011 and 2010 acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with ASC Topic 805,

Business Combinations,

as amended

.

The Company’s 2009 acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141.  Tangible assets and liabilities, based on preliminary purchase price allocations for 2011 acquisitions, were adjusted to fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill.  The identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of these acquisitions are not material.  Operating results of these acquisitions are included in the Company’s financial statements from the date of acquisition and are not significant to the Company’s consolidated operating results.

2011 Acquisitions

During 2011, the Company made four acquisitions for a total cost of $218 million in cash and recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price related to these acquisitions.  The net cash purchase price for these four acquisitions of $218 million plus the acquisition-date fair value of the equity interest the Company previously held in Golden Peanut was preliminarily allocated to working capital, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other long-term assets, and long-term liabilities for $113 million, $235 million, $63 million, $11 million, and $36 million, respectively.

The acquisition of Alimenta (USA), Inc., the Company’s former 50 percent

partner in Golden Peanut, was the only significant acquisition during the year.  This transaction resulted in the Company obtaining control of the remaining outstanding shares of Golden Peanut, the largest U.S. handler, processor and exporter of peanuts

and operator of one facility in Argentina.

This business fits well with the Company’s existing U.S. oilseed and export operations in its global oilseed business.  A pre-tax gain of $71 million was recognized in the second quarter as a result of revaluing the Company’s previously held investment in Golden Peanut in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent interest based on the guidance of ASC Topic 805,

Acquisitions (Continued)

2010 Acquisitions

During 2010, the Company acquired two businesses for a total cost of $62 million in cash.  The final purchase price allocations resulted in goodwill of $3 million.  The purchase price of $62 million was allocated to current assets, property, plant and equipment, and other long-term assets for $2 million, $57 million, and $3 million, respectively.

2009 Acquisitions

During 2009, the Company acquired ten businesses for a total cost of $198 million in cash and recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price related to these acquisitions.  The preliminary purchase price allocations resulted in goodwill of $31 million.  The purchase price of $198 million was allocated to current assets, property, plant and equipment, other long-term assets, and liabilities for $176 million, $82 million, $111 million, and $171 million, respectively.  The final valuations resulted in a $13 million reduction in the cost of one acquisition and a corresponding decrease in the amount previously allocated to current assets.  The finalization of the purchase price allocations related to these acquisitions resulted in a $7 million increase in goodwill and a corresponding decrease in other long-term assets.

Note 3.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines the fair value of certain of its inventories of agricultural commodities, derivative contracts, and marketable securities based on the fair value definition and hierarchy levels established in the guidance of ASC Topic 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

.  Three levels are established within the hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 1 assets and liabilities include exchange-traded derivative contracts, U.S. treasury securities and certain publicly traded equity securities.

Level 2:  Observable inputs, including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification.  Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.

In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy.  The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy.  The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.

The Company’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.  For the period ended June 30, 2011, the Company had no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.

Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value.  Estimated fair values for inventories carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets, broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter (OTC) markets.  In such cases, the inventory is classified in Level 2.  Certain inventories may require management judgment or estimation for a significant component of the fair value amount.  In such cases, the inventory is classified in Level 3.  Changes in the fair value of inventories are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.

The Company’s derivative contracts that are measured at fair value include forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, exchange-traded commodity futures and option contracts, and OTC instruments related primarily to agricultural commodities, ocean freight, energy, interest rates, and foreign currencies.  Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1.  The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in this table.  Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets.  These differences are generally determined using inputs from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets.  When observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, it is classified in Level 2.  When unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the contract is classified in Level 3.  Based on historical experience with the Company’s suppliers and customers, the Company’s own credit risk and knowledge of current market conditions, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.  However, in certain cases, if the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input, the Company records estimated fair value adjustments, and classifies the contract in Level 3. Except for certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of commodity-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of net sales and other operating income, cost of products sold, and other (income) expense–net.  The effective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged items are recorded in earnings or it is probable the hedged transaction will no longer occur.

The Company’s marketable securities are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. government agencies, corporate and municipal debt securities, and equity investments.  U.S. Treasury securities and certain publicly traded equity investments are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.  U.S. government agency obligations, corporate and municipal debt securities and certain equity investments are valued using third-party pricing services and substantially all are classified in Level 2.  Security values that are determined using pricing models are classified in Level 3.  Unrealized changes in the fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) unless a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary at which point the decline is recorded in earnings.

Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

The following tables present a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the twelve months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.

* Includes gains of $109 million that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to Level 3 assets and liabilities still held at June 30, 2011.

*Includes gains of $6 million that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to Level 3 assets and liabilities still held at June 30, 2010.

Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts rising above the 10% threshold.

Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10% threshold and thus requiring reclassification to Level 2.

The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet.  The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.  The majority of the Company’s derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments.  For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a reporting entity must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.  As of June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company has certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.  Within the Note 4 tables, zeros represent minimal amounts.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

The Company generally follows a policy of using exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts to manage its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in agricultural commodities and foreign currencies.  The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets.  Exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts, and forward cash purchase and sales contracts of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities accounted for as derivatives by the Company are stated at fair value.  Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  Inventory is not a derivative and therefore is

not included in the tables below

.

Changes in the market value of inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately.  Unrealized gains and unrealized losses on forward cash purchase contracts, forward foreign currency exchange (FX) contracts, forward cash sales contracts, and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts represent the fair value of such instruments and are classified on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as receivables and accrued expenses, respectively.

At March 31, 2010, the

Company de-designated and discontinued hedge accounting treatment for certain interest rate swaps.  At the date of de-designation of these hedges, $21 million of after-tax gains was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).  These gains remain in AOCI and are being amortized over 30 years.  The Company recognized in earnings $30 million of pre-tax gains and $59 million in pre-tax losses from these interest rate swaps for the year ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The following table sets forth the pre-tax gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments that have been included in the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.

Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  Inventory is not a derivative and therefore is not included in the table above.  Changes in the market value of inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Strategies

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument that is in excess of the cumulative change in the cash flows of the hedged item, if any (i.e., the ineffective portion), hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.

Inventories, Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued)

For each of the commodity hedge programs described below, the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.  The changes in the market value of such derivative contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Once the hedged item is recognized in earnings, the gains/losses arising from the hedge are reclassified from AOCI to either net sales and other operating income, cost of products sold, interest expense or other (income) expense – net, as applicable.  As of June 30, 2011, the Company has $1 million of after-tax gains in AOCI related to gains and losses from commodity cash flow hedge transactions.  The Company expects to recognize the $1 million of gains in its consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months.

The Company, from time to time, uses futures or options contracts to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of corn to be purchased and processed in a future month.  The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s forecasted purchases of corn.  The Company’s corn processing plants currently grind approximately 75 million bushels of corn per month.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 1% and 100% of its monthly anticipated grind.  At June 30, 2011, the Company has designated hedges representing 1% of its anticipated monthly grind of corn for the next 6 months.

The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to fix the purchase price of the Company’s anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities.  The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s forecasted purchases of natural gas.  These production facilities use approximately 3.8 million MMbtus of natural gas per month.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 48% and 58% of the quantity of its anticipated monthly natural gas purchases.  At June 30, 2011, the Company has designated hedges representing between 13% to 37% of its anticipated monthly natural gas purchases for the next 12 months.

The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to fix the sales price of certain ethanol sales contracts.  The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s sales of ethanol under sales contracts that are indexed to unleaded gasoline prices.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 7 million to 17 million gallons of ethanol per month under this program.  At June 30, 2011, the Company has designated hedges representing between 1 million to 14 million gallons of contracted ethanol sales per month over the next 9 months.

To protect against fluctuations in cash flows due to foreign currency exchange rates, the Company from time to time will use forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges.  Certain production facilities have manufacturing expenses and equipment purchases denominated in non-functional currencies.  To reduce the risk of fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in the exchange rate between functional versus non-functional currencies, the Company will hedge some portion of the forecasted foreign currency expenditures.  At June 30, 2011, the Company has $2 million of after-tax gains in AOCI related to foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments.  The Company will recognize the $2 million of gains in its consolidated statement of earnings over the life of the hedged transactions.

The Company, from time to time, uses treasury lock agreements and interest rate swaps in order to lock in the Company’s interest rate prior to the issuance or remarketing of its long-term debt.  Both the treasury-lock agreements and interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in the future interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate.  The objective of the treasury-lock agreements and interest rate swaps was to protect the Company from changes in the benchmark rate from the date of hedge designation to the date when the debt was actually issued.  At June 30, 2011, AOCI included $22 million of after-tax gains related to treasury-lock agreements and interest rate swaps, of which, $21 million relates to the interest rate swaps that were de-designated at March 31, 2010 as discussed earlier in Note 4.  The Company will recognize the $22 million of gains in its consolidated statement of earnings over the terms of the hedged items which range from 10 to 30 years.

Marketable Securities and Cash Equivalents (Continued)

All of the $4 million in unrealized losses at June 30, 2011 arose within the last 12 months.  The market value of the investments that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months is $9 million.  The $4 million in unrealized losses associated with available-for-sale equity securities is related to the Company’s investment in one security.  The Company evaluated the near-term prospects of the issuer in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment.  Based on that evaluation and the Company’s ability and intent to hold this investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value, the Company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at June 30, 2011.

Debt and Financing Arrangements (Continued)

In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of Equity Units, which were a combination of debt and a forward contract for the holder to purchase the Company’s common stock.  The debt and equity instruments were deemed to be separate instruments as the investor may transfer or settle the equity instrument separately from the debt instrument.

On March 30, 2011, the Company initiated a remarketing of the $1.75 billion 4.7% debentures underlying the Equity Units into two tranches:  $0.75 billion principal amount of 4.479% notes due in 2021 and $1.0 billion principal amount of 5.765% debentures due in 2041.  As a result of the remarketing, the Company was required to use the “if-converted” method of calculating diluted earnings per share with respect to the forward contracts for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 (see Note 9).  The Company incurred early extinguishment of debt charges of $8 million as a result of the debt remarketing.

The forward purchase contracts underlying the Equity Units were settled on June 1, 2011, for 44 million shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for receipt of $1.75 billion in cash.

On February 11, 2011, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due on August 13, 2012.  Interest on the notes accrues at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR reset quarterly plus 0.16% and is paid quarterly.  As of June 30, 2011, the interest rate on the notes was 0.42%.

In March 2010, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $500 million of its outstanding debentures in accordance with its announced tender offers, resulting in charges on early extinguishment of debt of $75 million, which consisted of $71 million in premium and other related expenses and $4 million in write-off of debt issuance costs.

In February 2007, the Company issued $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2014 (the Notes) in a private placement.  The Notes were issued at par and bear interest at a rate of 0.875% per year, payable semiannually.  The Notes are convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 22.8423 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $43.78 per share).  The Notes may be converted, subject to adjustment, only under the following circumstances: 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after March 31, 2007, if the closing price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter is more than 140% of the applicable conversion price per share, which is $1,000 divided by the then applicable conversion rate, 2) during the five consecutive business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the note measurement period) in which the average of the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average of the product of the closing price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate at each date during the note measurement period, 3) if the Company makes specified distributions to its common stockholders or specified corporate transactions occur, or 4) at any time on or after January 15, 2014, through the business day preceding the maturity date.  Upon conversion, a holder would receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of 1) $1,000 and 2) the conversion value, as defined.  If the conversion value exceeds $1,000, the Company will deliver, at the Company’s election, cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock for the conversion value in excess of $1,000.  If the Notes are converted in connection with a change in control, as defined, the Company may be required to provide a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate, subject to a stated maximum amount.  In addition, in the event of a change in control, the holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.  In accordance with ASC Topic 470-20, the Company recognized the Notes proceeds received in 2007 as long-term debt of $853 million and equity of $297 million.  The discount on the long-term debt is being amortized over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. Discount amortization expense of $43 million, $40 million, and $39 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, were included in interest expense related to the Notes.

Debt and Financing Arrangements (Continued)

Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call options in private transactions at a cost of $300 million.  The purchased call options allow the Company to receive shares of its common stock and/or cash from the counterparties equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess of the current market price of the Company’s common stock over the exercise price of the purchased call options.  In addition, the Company sold warrants in private transactions to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 26.3 million shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $62.56 per share and received proceeds of $170 million.  If the average price of the Company’s common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be settled, at the Company’s option, in cash or shares of common stock.  The purchased call options and warrants are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future conversions of the Notes by effectively increasing the initial conversion price to $62.56 per share.  The net cost of the purchased call options and warrant transactions of $130 million was recorded as a reduction of shareholders’ equity.

As of June 30, 2011, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the Notes had been satisfied.  In addition, as of June 30, 2011, the market price of the Company’s common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants.  As of June 30, 2011, no share amounts related to the conversion of the Notes or exercise of the warrants are included in diluted average shares outstanding.

At June 30, 2011, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt exceeded the carrying value by $842 million, as estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the five years after June 30, 2011, are $178 million, $1.8 billion, $1.1 billion, $28 million, and $17 million, respectively.

At June 30, 2011, the Company had pledged certain property, plant, and equipment with a carrying value of $344 million as security for certain long-term debt obligations.

At June 30, 2011, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.9 billion, of which $5.7 billion were unused.  The weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2011 and 2010, were 0.65% and 2.29%, respectively.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $4.6 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was $620 million of commercial paper outstanding at June 30, 2011.

The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of June 30, 2011.

The Company has outstanding standby letters of credit and surety bonds at June 30, 2011 and 2010, totaling $620 million and $459 million, respectively.

On July 1, 2011, the Company entered into a 364-day accounts receivable securitization facility.  The facility provides the Company with up to $1.0 billion in liquidity.  Under the facility, the Company’s U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity which then sells an undivided interest in the receivable as a collateral for any borrowings under the facility.  Any borrowings under the facility will be recorded as secured borrowings.  As of August 24, 2011, the Company had not used the facility.  This facility expands the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets.

Shareholders’ Equity

The Company has authorized one billion shares of common stock and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, each with zero par value.  No preferred stock has been issued.  At June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had approximately 40.3 million and 32.6 million shares, respectively, in treasury.  Treasury stock of $1.1 billion at June 30, 2011, and $838 million at June 30, 2010, is recorded at cost as a reduction of common stock.

The Company’s employee stock compensation plans provide for the granting of options to employees to purchase common stock of the Company pursuant to the Company’s 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan, 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan and 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan.  These options are issued at market value on the date of grant, vest incrementally over five to nine years, and expire ten years after the date of grant.

The Company’s 1999, 2002 and 2009 Incentive Compensation Plans provide for the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units (Restricted Stock Awards) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.  In addition, the Company’s 2002 and 2009 Incentive Compensation Plans also provide for the granting of performance stock units (PSUs) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.  Restricted Stock Awards are made in common stock or stock units with equivalent rights and vest at the end of a three-year restriction period.  The awards for PSUs are made in common stock and vest at the end of a three-year vesting period subject to the attainment of certain future performance criteria.  During 2011, 2010, and 2009, 1.1 million, 1.0 million, and 1.1 million common stock or stock units, respectively, were granted as Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs.  At June 30, 2011, there were 28.1 million shares available for future grants pursuant to the 2009 plan.

Compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs granted to employees is generally recognized on a straight-line basis during the service period of the respective grant.  Certain of the Company’s option grants, Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs continue to vest upon the recipient’s retirement from the Company and compensation expense related to option grants and Restricted Stock Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized in earnings on the date of grant.  Total compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs recognized during 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $47 million, $45 million, and $65 million, respectively.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model.  The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock.  The volatility of the Company’s stock was calculated based upon the monthly closing price of the Company’s stock for the period immediately prior to the date of grant corresponding to the average expected life of the grant.  The average expected life represents the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding.  The risk-free rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of option grants.  The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model are as follows.

The Company has $220 million and $135 million of tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forwards of certain international subsidiaries at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  As of June 30, 2011, approximately $211 million of these assets have no expiration date, and the remaining $9 million expire at various times through fiscal 2024.  The annual usage of certain of these assets is limited to a percentage of taxable income of the respective international subsidiary for the year. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $52 million and $38 million against these tax assets at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to the uncertainty of their realization.

The Company has $46 million and $41 million of tax assets related to excess foreign tax credits at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which begin to expire in fiscal 2013.  The Company has $57 million and $50 million of tax assets related to state income tax attributes (incentive credits and net operating loss carryforwards), net of federal tax benefit, at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which will expire at various times through fiscal 2017. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $7 million against the excess foreign tax credits at June 30, 2011, due to the uncertainty of realization.  The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the state income tax assets of $36 million, net of federal tax benefit, as of June 30, 2011.  As of June 30, 2010, the Company had a $7 million valuation allowance recorded related to the excess foreign tax credits and a $26 million valuation allowance related to state income tax attributes, due to the uncertainty of realization.

The Company remains subject to federal examination in the U.S. for the calendar tax year 2010.

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and the Company’s share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately $8.2 billion at June 30, 2011, are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon.  It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to these undistributed earnings.

During 2009, approximately $158 million of income tax expense was incurred related to the Company’s investment in Wilmar International Holdings, Limited (WIHL), a subsidiary of ADM Asia Pacific, Limited (ADMAP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  On April 1, 2009, WIHL distributed publicly traded shares of Wilmar to ADMAP which triggered the $158 million of income tax expense.  Additionally, the Company recognized $12 million of income tax expense during fiscal year 2010 related to the 2009 distribution.  Through WIHL, ADMAP holds a direct ownership interest in Wilmar.

Income Taxes (Continued)

The Company accounts for its income tax positions under the provisions of ASC Topic 740,

Income Taxes

.  ASC Topic 740 prescribes a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  This interpretation requires the Company to recognize in the consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.  The total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:

The additions and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits shown in the table include effects related to net income and shareholders’ equity.  The 2011 changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Company’s net income or cash flow.

The Company classifies interest on income tax related balances as interest expense or interest income and classifies tax-related penalties as selling, general and administrative expenses.  At June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $27 million in both years.

The Company is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world.  Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete.  Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions.  However, the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months.  Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions, the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Company’s effective income tax rate in any given period.  If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized by the Company at one time, there would be a positive impact of $45 million on the tax expense for that period.

Income Taxes (Continued)

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ADM do Brasil Ltda. (“ADM do Brasil”), received three separate tax assessments from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service (“BFRS”) challenging the tax deductibility of commodity hedging losses and related expenses incurred by ADM do Brasil.  The tax assessments are for income tax, penalties and interest for the tax years 2004, 2006 and 2007 in the amounts of $549 million, $22 million, and $94 million, respectively (adjusted for interest and variation in currency exchange rates).  ADM do Brasil’s tax return for 2005 was also audited and no assessment was received.  The statute of limitations for 2005 has expired.  If the BFRS were to challenge commodity hedging deductions in tax years after 2007, the Company estimates it could receive additional claims of approximately $114 million (as of June 30, 2011 and subject to variation in currecy exchange rates).

ADM do Brasil enters into commodity hedging transactions that can result in gains, which are included in ADM do Brasil’s calculations of taxable income in Brazil, and losses, which ADM do Brasil deducts from its taxable income in Brazil.  The Company has evaluated its tax position regarding these hedging transactions and concluded, based upon advice from Brazilian legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize both gains and losses resulting from hedging transactions when determining its Brazilian income tax expense.  Therefore, the Company has continued to recognize the tax benefit from hedging losses in its financial statements and has not recorded any tax liability for the amounts assessed by the BFRS.

ADM do Brasil filed an administrative appeal for each of the assessments.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, a decision in favor of the BFRS on the 2004 assessment was received and a second level administrative appeal has been filed. There have been no decisions on the initial appeal related to the 2006 and 2007 assessments.  If ADM do Brasil continues to be unsuccessful in the administrative appellate process, further appeals are available in the Brazilian federal courts.  While the Company believes that its consolidated financial statements properly reflect the tax deductibility of these hedging losses, the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in the future recognition of additional payments of, and expense for, income tax and the associated interest and penalties.  The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for years subsequent to 2007.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits.  Eligible U.S. employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan.  Eligible U.S. employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a “cash balance” pension formula.  The Company provides eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are “grandfathered” into subsidized coverage).

The Company also maintains 401(k) plans covering substantially all U.S. employees.  The Company contributes cash to the plans to match qualifying employee contributions, and also provides a non-matching employer contribution of 1% of pay to eligible participants.  Under an employee stock ownership component of the 401(k) plans, employees may choose to invest in ADM stock as part of their own investment elections.  The employer contributions are expensed when paid.  Assets of the Company’s 401(k) plans consist primarily of listed common stocks and pooled funds.  The Company’s 401(k) plans held 16.3 million shares of Company common stock at June 30, 2011, with a market value of $490 million.  Cash dividends received on shares of Company common stock by these plans during the year ended June 30, 2011 were $10 million.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, was $2.3 billion and $ 2.1 billion, respectively.

For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 7.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2011.  The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5% for 2022 and remain at that level thereafter.

Plan Assets

The Company’s employee benefit plan assets are principally comprised of the following types of investments:

ADM and other common stock:

Equity securities are valued based on quoted exchange prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Mutual funds:

Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Common collective trust (CCT) funds:

The fair values of the CCTs are based on the cumulative net asset value (NAV) of their underlying investments. The investments in CCTs are comprised of international equity funds, a small cap U.S. equity fund, large cap U.S. equity funds, fixed income funds, and other funds.  The fund units are valued at NAV based on the closing market value of the units bought or sold as of the valuation date and are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The CCTs seek primarily to provide investment results approximating the aggregate price, dividend performance, total return, and income stream of underlying investments of the funds.  Issuances and redemptions of certain of the CCT investments may be restricted by date and/or amount.

Corporate debt instruments:

Corporate debt instruments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

U.S.  Treasury instruments:

U.S. Treasury instruments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

U.S. government agency, state, and local government bonds:

U.S. government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

The Company’s pension plans did not hold any shares of Company common stock as of the June 30, 2011 measurement date.  Cash dividends received on shares of Company common stock by these plans during the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2011, were $0.1 million.

Investment objectives for the Company’s plan assets are to:

·

Optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk.

·

Maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers.

Maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.

Asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans.  Selection of the targeted asset allocation for plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes.  The U.S. pension plans target asset allocation is also based on an asset and liability study that is updated periodically.

Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.  These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements, and credit quality standards, where applicable.  In some countries, derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of underlying investments.

The Company uses external consultants to assist in monitoring the investment strategy and asset mix for the Company’s plan assets.  To develop the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets, the Company generally uses long-term historical return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability studies.  Adjustments are made to the expected long-term rate of return assumption when deemed necessary based upon revised expectations of future investment performance of the overall investment markets.

Segment and Geographic Information

The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  The Company’s operations are organized, managed and classified into three reportable business segments:  Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing, and Agricultural Services.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations, which include wheat processing, cocoa processing, and its financial business units, are not reportable segments, as defined by ASC Topic 280,

Segment Reporting,

and are classified as Other.

The Oilseeds Processing segment includes activities related to the origination, merchandising, crushing, and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable oils and protein meals.  Oilseeds products produced and marketed by the Company include ingredients for the food, feed, energy, and other industrial products industries.  Crude vegetable oils produced by the segment’s crushing activities are sold “as is” or are further processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.  Salad oils are sold “as is” or are further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products.  Partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products.  Oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds.  The Oilseeds Processing segment also produces natural health and nutrition products and other specialty food and feed ingredients.  In North America, cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the pharmaceutical industry and cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and filter markets.  In Europe and South America, the Oilseeds Processing segment includes origination and merchandising activities of a network of grain elevators, port facilities, and transportation assets used to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, as adjuncts to its oilseeds processing assets.  In South America, the Oilseeds Processing segment operates fertilizer blending facilities.  Effective December 31, 2010, the Company acquired Alimenta (USA) Inc., and as a result of the transaction, now owns 100% of Golden Peanut, the leading U.S. peanut sheller and oil refiner and operator of one facility in Argentina.  The Oilseeds Processing segment began consolidating the operating results of Golden Peanut, its previously 50% owned joint venture, in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.  The Oilseeds Processing segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity investment in Wilmar and its share of results for its Edible Oils Limited and Stratas Foods, LLC joint ventures.

Segment and Geographic Information (Continued)

The Company’s Corn Processing segment is engaged in corn wet milling and dry milling activities, with its asset base primarily located in the central part of the United States.  The Corn Processing segment converts corn into sweeteners and starches and bioproducts.  Its products include ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, starch, syrup, glucose, and dextrose.  Dextrose and starch are used by the Corn Processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations.  By fermentation of dextrose, the Corn Processing segment produces alcohol, amino acids, and other specialty food and animal feed ingredients.  Ethyl alcohol is produced by the Company for industrial use as ethanol or as beverage grade.  Ethanol, in gasoline, increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate.  Bioproducts also include amino acids such as lysine and threonine that are vital compounds used in swine feeds to produce leaner animals and in poultry feeds to enhance the speed and efficiency of poultry production.  Corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers’ grains, are produced for use as animal feed ingredients.  Corn germ, a by-product of the wet milling process, is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal.  Other corn processing products include citric and lactic acids, lactates, sorbitol, xanthan gum, and glycols which are used in various food and industrial products.  The Corn Processing segment includes the activities of the Company’s Brazilian sugarcane operations, propylene and ethylene glycol facility, a bioplastic facility, and other equity investments in renewable plastics.  This segment includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity investments in Almidones Mexicanos S.A., Eaststarch C.V., and Red Star Yeast Company LLC.

The Agricultural Services segment utilizes its extensive U.S. grain elevator and global transportation network to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.  Agricultural Services’ grain sourcing and transportation network provides reliable and efficient services to the Company’s customers and agricultural processing operations. Agricultural Services’ transportation network capabilities include truck, rail, barge, port, and ocean-going vessel handling and freight services.  The Agricultural Services segment includes the activities of Alfred C. Toepfer International, an 80% owned global merchant of agricultural commodities and processed products.  The Agricultural Services segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its Kalama Export Company joint venture, activities related to the processing and distributing of formula feeds and animal health and nutrition products, and the procuring, processing, and distributing of edible beans.

Other includes the Company’s remaining processing operations, consisting of activities related to processing agricultural commodities into food ingredient products such as wheat into wheat flour, and cocoa into chocolate and cocoa products.  Other also includes financial activities related to banking, captive insurance, futures commission merchant activities, private equity fund investments, and the Company’s share of the results of its equity investment in Gruma S.A.B de C.V.

Intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market.  Operating profit for each segment is based on net sales less identifiable operating expenses, including an interest charge related to working capital usage.  Also included in segment operating profit is equity in earnings of affiliates based on the equity method of accounting.

Certain Corporate items are not allocated to the Company’s reportable business segments.  Corporate results include the impact of LIFO-related adjustments, the after-tax elimination of income attributable to mandatorily redeemable interests in consolidated subsidiaries, unallocated corporate expenses, and unallocated net interest costs.

Prior year sales to external customers by segment and intersegment sales have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation resulting in reclassified net sales at the segment level with no impact to total net sales or operating profit by segment.  In addition, inventories and accrued expenses in prior year’s consolidated balance sheet have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation with a corresponding change to prior year’s identifiable assets by segment.

Contingencies, Guarantees and Commitments

Since August 2008, the Company has been conducting an internal review of its policies, procedures and internal controls pertaining to the adequacy of its anti-corruption compliance program and of certain transactions conducted by the Company and its affiliates and joint ventures, primarily relating to grain and feed exports, that may have violated company policies, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other U.S. and foreign laws.  The Company initially disclosed this review to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and certain foreign regulators in March 2009 and has subsequently provided periodic updates to the agencies.  The Company engaged outside counsel and other advisors to assist in the review of these matters and has implemented, and is continuing to implement, appropriate remedial measures.  In connection with this review, government agencies could impose civil penalties or criminal fines and/or order that the Company disgorge any profits derived from any contracts involving inappropriate payments.  These events have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on the Company’s business or financial condition.

The Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligations.  The Company has not recorded a liability for payment of these contingent obligations, as the Company believes the fair value of these contingent obligations is immaterial.  The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.  These contingent obligations totaled $121 million at June 30, 2011.  Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $69 million at June 30, 2011.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Decatur, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company at June 30, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated August 24, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Decatur, Illinois

We have audited Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2011, of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company and our report dated August 24, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

There was no change in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s (“ADM’s”) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on this assessment, management concluded that ADM’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2011.
