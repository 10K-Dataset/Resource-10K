PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

Company Overview

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in 1923, successor to the Daniels Linseed Co. founded in 1902.  The Company is one of the world’s leading producers of food and beverage ingredients, and other products made from a variety of agricultural products.  The Company's products include natural flavors and colors, health and nutrition products, vegetable oil, corn sweeteners, flour, animal feed, and biofuels.  The Company has an extensive global grain elevator and transportation network to procure, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, and barley, as well as products derived from those inputs.  The Company has significant investments in joint ventures.  The Company expects to benefit from these investments, which typically aim to expand or enhance the Company’s market for its products or offer other benefits including, but not limited to, geographic or product line expansion.

The Company’s vision is to be the most admired global agribusiness and nutrition company while creating value and growing responsibly.  The Company’s growth strategy is spread across its five key growth platforms:  Taste, Nutrition, Animal Nutrition, Health and Wellness, and Carbohydrates.  The Company desires to execute this vision and these strategies by conducting its business in accordance with its core values of operating with integrity, treating others with respect, achieving excellence, being resourceful, displaying teamwork, and being responsible.

As the world population grows, so does demand for quality foods, feed ingredients for livestock, alternative fuels, and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional chemicals.  As one of the world's leading agricultural and food ingredient processors, the Company plays a pivotal role in meeting all of these needs in sustainable ways.  The Company produces the food ingredients, biofuels, and other products that manufacturers around the world use to provide wholesome food and a better life to millions of people around the globe.

Segment Descriptions

The Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable business segments: Origination, Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.  Financial information with respect to the Company’s reportable business segments is set forth in Note 17 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 herein, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” (Item 8).

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect changes in its operating structure.  The Company's new segments are Origination (formerly Agricultural Services), Oilseeds (formerly Oilseeds Processing), Carbohydrate Solutions (formerly Corn Processing), and Nutrition (formerly Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients).  The European origination business previously reported in Oilseeds is now managed by leaders in Origination to better coordinate continental trading activities.  Carbohydrate Solutions now includes the results of ADM Milling, which were previously reported in Origination.  In addition, the Company also moved the segment reporting of its renewable chemicals business from Carbohydrate Solutions to Oilseeds effective July 1, 2018.  Nutrition now includes the results of Animal Nutrition and certain product lines previously reported in Carbohydrate Solutions as well as certain product lines previously reported in Oilseeds.

Origination

The Origination segment utilizes its extensive global grain elevator and transportation networks and port operations to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.  The Origination segment also includes international agricultural commodities merchandising and handling activities managed through a global trade desk based in Rolle, Switzerland.  The Origination segment’s grain sourcing, handling, and transportation network provides reliable and efficient services to the Company’s customers and agricultural processing operations.  The Origination segment’s transportation network capabilities include barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, and container freight services.  The Origination segment also includes the activities related to structured trade finance, the import and distribution of agricultural feed products, and the Company’s share of the results of its Pacificor joint venture.

Oilseeds

The Oilseeds segment includes global activities related to the origination, merchandising, crushing, and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable oils and protein meals.  Oilseeds products produced and marketed by the Company include ingredients for the food, feed, energy, and industrial products industries.  Crude vegetable oils produced by the segment’s crushing activities are sold “as is” or are further processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.  Salad oils are sold “as is” or are further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel and glycols or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products.  Oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds.  In South America, the Oilseeds segment includes origination and merchandising activities as adjuncts to its oilseeds processing assets.  These activities include a network of grain elevators, port facilities, and transportation assets used to buy, store, clean, and transport grains and oilseeds.  The Oilseeds segment is a major supplier of peanuts, tree nuts, and peanut-derived ingredients to both the U.S. and export markets.  In North America, cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the pharmaceutical industry and cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and other industrial markets.  The Oilseeds segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited (Wilmar) and its share of the results of its Stratas Foods LLC, Edible Oils Limited, and Olenex Sarl (Olenex) joint ventures.  In June 2018, the Company invested in SoyVen, a

BUSINESS (Continued)

Methods of Distribution

The Company’s products are distributed mainly in bulk from processing plants or storage facilities directly to customers’ facilities.  The Company has developed a comprehensive transportation capability to efficiently move both commodities and processed products virtually anywhere in the world.  The Company owns or leases a significant portion of the trucks, trailers, railroad tank and hopper cars, river barges, towboats, and ocean-going vessels used to transport the Company’s products to its customers.

Concentration of Revenues by Product

The following products accounted for 10% or more of revenues for the following periods:

Status of New Products

The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products.  Acquisitions, especially in the Nutrition segment, expand the Company’s ability to serve customers’ evolving needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products.  The Company does not expect any individual new product to have a significant impact on the Company’s revenues in 2019.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

A significant majority of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities.  In addition, the Company sources specific fruits, vegetables, and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors.  In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  The Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, EMEA, Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis.  The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials.

Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses

The Company owns patents, trademarks, and licenses with a net book value of

$269 million

as of December 31, 2018.  The Company does not consider any segment of its business to be dependent upon any single or group of patents, trademarks or licenses.

Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers

Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services.  There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains.

The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company’s working capital requirements.  Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months.  Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.  No material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.  The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world.  Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.


Item 1.

BUSINESS (Continued)

Competition

The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company.  Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset portfolio.

Research and Development

Research and development expense during the year ended

December 31, 2018

, net of reimbursements of government grants, was

$141 million

.

The Company’s laboratories and technical centers around the world enhance its ability to interact with customers globally, not only to provide flavors, but also to support the sales of other food ingredients.  The acquisition of Wild Flavors in October 2014 approximately doubled the number of scientists and technicians in research and development.  Since that time, additional laboratories have been added, including food & beverages applications laboratories in Fort Collins, Colorado and Bergamo, Italy as well as expanded laboratories in Decatur, Illinois and Shanghai, China.  In April 2018, the Company also opened its new enzyme development laboratory in Davis, California to advance the research and development of feed enzyme as well as enzymes for internal use.

The Company expanded its human health and nutrition portfolio in February 2017 with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Biopolis SL (Biopolis), a leading provider of probiotics and genomic services.  Biopolis provides genomic sequencing capabilities for the Company's customers as well as for its internal use.  Biopolis also has high through-put biological functionality testing capabilities that can be used to discover new probiotics and nutraceuticals.  In January 2018, the Company announced a joint development agreement with Vland Biotech to develop and commercialize enzymes for animal feed.  In August 2018, the Company further expanded its probiotics business with the acquisition of Probiotics International Limited.

ADM Ventures, which was launched by the Company in October 2016, continues to select high-potential, new product development projects from within its business units.  The first internal venture funded project, a new sweetener, has been fully commercialized and is being sold in the United States by our Carbohydrate Solutions team.  ADM Ventures has also made equity investments in three promising early-stage start-up companies and is looking at several others in which the Company may choose to invest.

The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of sustainable materials with an objective to produce key intermediate materials that serve as a platform for producing a variety of sustainable packaging products.  Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both fermentation and catalysis.  The Company’s current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration.  The Company’s project with DuPont to develop sustainable packaging solutions with improved barrier properties has progressed to a pilot production facility that opened in April 2018.  This facility provides samples for customers as well as engineering data for a full-scale plant.

Environmental Compliance

During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, the Company spent

$42 million

specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.

There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.

A number of jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including, but not limited to, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the E.U. and its member states, and China.  The Company's operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet their obligations in this regard with no significant impact on the earnings and competitive position of the Company.  The Company’s business could be affected in the future by additional global, regional, national, and local regulation, pricing of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change legislation, regulation or agreements.  It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or


Item 1.

BUSINESS (Continued)

agreements.  Potential consequences of new obligations could include increased energy, transportation, raw material, and administrative costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment.

Number of Employees

The number of full-time employees of the Company was approximately

31,600

at

December 31, 2018

and

31,300

at

December 31, 2017

.  The net increase in the number of full-time employees is primarily related to acquisitions net of divestitures.

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The Company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance.

Management directs a Company-wide Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program, with oversight from the Company’s Board of Directors.  The Company’s Audit Committee has the delegated risk management oversight responsibility and receives updates on the risk management processes and key risk factors on a quarterly basis.

The Company, through its business unit, functional, and corporate teams, continually updates, assesses, monitors, and mitigates these and other business and compliance risks in accordance with the ERM Program and as monitored by the ERM Program team and Chief Risk Officer.

The risk factors that follow are the main risks that the ERM program focuses on to protect and enhance shareholder value through intentional risk mitigation plans based on management-defined risk limits.


Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

The availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the Company procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises can be affected by climate change, weather conditions, disease, government programs, competition, and various other factors beyond the Company’s control and could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations, including impacts from factors outside the Company's control such as changes in weather and climate, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, and changes in global demand.  The Company uses a global network of procurement, processing, and transportation assets, as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams, to continually assess price and basis opportunities.  Management-established limits (including a corporate wide value-at-risk metric), with robust internal reporting, help to optimize results versus the Company’s strategic plans.  Additionally, the Company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities.

Reduced supply of agricultural commodities could adversely affect the Company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limiting the Company’s ability to procure, transport, store, process, and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner.  For example, a drought in Argentina in 2017 and 2018 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased.  High and volatile commodity prices can place more pressures on short-term working capital funding.  Conversely, if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles, price volatility is somewhat diminished.  This could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities.

Advances in technology, such as seed and crop protection, farming techniques, or speed of information flow, may reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets, which may reduce the earnings potential of agricultural merchandisers and processors such as the Company.

The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates.

The Company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors, who can be different depending upon each of the business segments in which it participates.  The Company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities, transportation services, and other materials and supplies, as well as for workforce and talent.  Competition impacts the Company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors:  Pricing of the Company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity on-line, build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation; many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and, in many cases, subject to substitution; significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries, could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than U.S. products; improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the Company has a significant presence; and continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry, especially when acquirers are state-owned and/or backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises.  To compete effectively, the Company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market presence, maintaining a high level of product safety and quality, and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions.

Fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices.  The Company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity, natural gas, and coal.  The Company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.  Significant increases in the cost of these items, including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases, could adversely affect the Company’s production costs and operating results.


Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

The Company has certain finished products, such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products, or in the case of ethanol, blended into gasoline to increase octane content.  Therefore, the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other octane enhancers.  A significant decrease in the price of gasoline, diesel fuel, or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the Company’s ethanol and biodiesel.  The Company uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energy-based products in order to protect itself in the near term against these price trends and to protect and maximize processing margins.

The Company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas. While

55 percent

of the Company’s processing plants and

61 percent

of its procurement facilities are located in the United States, the Company also has significant operations in both developed areas (such as Western Europe, Canada, and Brazil) and emerging market areas.  One of the Company’s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model, which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas.  Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns, including decreased demand for the Company’s products, and reduced availability of credit, or declining credit quality of the Company’s suppliers, customers, and other counterparties.  In addition, emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including, but not limited to, logistics limitations or delays, labor-related challenges, limitations or regulations affecting trade flows, local currency concerns, and other economic and political instability.  Political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets, potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes, fees, increased risks of corruption, etc.  Economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and ability to execute its long-term business strategies.  The Company mitigates this risk in many ways, including country risk and exposure analysis, government relations and tax compliance activities, and robust ethics compliance training requirements.

The Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations, and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and forward strategy.

The Company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in more than


countries, and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the United States federal government as well as state, local, and non-U.S. governmental authorities in areas including:  Accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, environmental, product safety, and handling and production of regulated substances.  The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies, including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation.  Resolution of some of these tax disputes could take many years and interest and penalties may be accruing in the meantime, thereby significantly increasing the notional amount of the exposures.

The production of the Company’s products use materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances, including greenhouse gas emissions.  The Company has programs and policies in place (e.g., Corporate Sustainability Program, No-Deforestation Policy, Environmental Policy, etc.) to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations, as any failure to comply can have serious consequences, including civil, administrative, and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the Company’s reputation, business, cash flows, and results of operations.

In addition, changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations - for example, the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws - may require the Company to modify existing processing facilities and/or processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results.


Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

Government policies, mandates, and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries; regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses; taxation polices; and political instability could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

Agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, regulations, and trade agreements, including taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, and import and export restrictions, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, traceability standards, product safety and labeling, renewable fuels, and low carbon fuel mandates.  These policies can influence the planting of certain crops; the location and size of crop production; whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded; the volume and types of imports and exports; the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials; the viability and volume of production of certain of the Company’s products; and industry profitability.  For example, changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including, but not limited to, changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States, can have an impact on the Company’s operating results.  International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions.  Regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the Dodd-Frank Act, Consumer Protection Act, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, and could adversely affect the Company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices.  Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Company’s products; adversely affect the Company's ability to deploy adequate hedging programs; restrict the Company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets; and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.

The Company’s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary, fiscal, trade, and environmental policies, laws, regulations, and acquisition approvals, creating risks including, but not limited to:  Changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, and safety and environmental regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions on currency exchange activities; currency exchange fluctuations; burdensome taxes and tariffs; enforceability of legal agreements and judgments; adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes; and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases.  International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the Company’s ability to transact business in these markets.  There has been a recent increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and the concept and benefits of free trade are being challenged.  The Company has benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the U.S. and other sources to markets around the world.  Increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world (e.g., the China trade tariffs, Iran sanctions) could negatively impact the Company's ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets.

The Company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio.  Government policies including, but not limited to, antitrust and competition law, trade restrictions, food safety regulations, sustainability requirements, and traceability, can impact the Company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully.

The Company is subject to industry-specific risks which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company is subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, product safety or quality; shifting consumer preferences; federal, state, and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; socially acceptable farming practices; environmental, health, and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims.  The liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the Company.  The Company has a particularly strong capability and culture around occupational health and safety and food safety; however, risks to the Company's reputation may exist due to potential negative publicity caused by product liability, food safety, occupational health and safety, and environmental matters.

Certain of the Company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.  The Company is subject to risks associated with economic, product quality, feed safety or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses, including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry, which could adversely affect demand for the Company’s products used as ingredients in feed.  In addition, as the Company increases its investment in flavors and ingredients businesses, it is exposed to increased risks related to rapidly changing consumer preferences and the impacts these changes could have on the success of certain of the Company's customers.


Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

The Company is exposed to potential business disruption including, but not limited to, disruption of transportation services, supply of non-commodity raw materials used in its processing operations, and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, and accidents which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services the disruption of which could result in difficulties supplying materials to the Company’s facilities and impair the Company’s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner.  The Company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively.  In addition, if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials, such as water or certain chemicals used in the Company’s processing operations, are not available, the Company’s business could be disrupted.  Any major lack of available water for use in certain of the Company’s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results.  Certain factors which may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Company’s control including, but not limited to, disruptions resulting from weather, economic conditions, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of materials, interruption of energy supply, and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions.

The assets and operations of the Company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism (for example, purposeful adulteration of the Company’s products), war, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, and fires. The Company is continuing to enhance and deploy additional food safety and security procedures and controls to appropriately mitigate the risks of any adulteration of the Company’s products in the supply chain and finished products in production and distribution networks. In addition, the Company conforms to management systems, such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or other recognized global standards.

The Company’s business is capital-intensive in nature and the Company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs.  Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company requires significant capital, including continuing access to credit markets, to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy.  The Company’s working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.  The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets, and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations, and changing safety standards in the industry.  Moreover, the expansion of the Company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital.  Access to credit markets and pricing of the Company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies.  Sufficient credit ratings allow the Company to access cost competitive tier one commercial paper markets.  If the Company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings, access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected.  If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the Company’s current operations and its growth opportunities.  The Company manages this risk with constant monitoring of credit/liquidity metrics, cash forecasting, and routine communications with credit rating agencies on risk management practices.

The Company’s risk management strategies may not be effective.

The Company has a Chief Risk Officer who regularly reports to the Board of Directors on the myriad of risks facing the Company and the Company's strategies for mitigating the risks.  In particular, the Company’s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity markets.  The Company monitors position limits and counterparty risks and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks.  The Company regularly reports its aggregate commodity risk exposures to the Board of Directors through the ERM process.  The Company has an established commodity merchandising governance process to ensure proper position reporting and monitoring, limit approvals, and execute training on trade compliance, commodity regulatory reporting controls, and other policies.  The Company’s monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure.  If these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the Company’s exposure to these fluctuations, it could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.


Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

The Company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures.

The Company has

$5.3 billion

invested in or advanced to joint ventures and investments over which the Company has limited control as to the governance and management activities.  Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended

December 31, 2018

was

$6.8 billion

.  Risks related to these investments may include:  The financial strength of the investment partner; loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit; the inability to implement beneficial management strategies, including risk management and compliance monitoring, with respect to the investment’s activities; and the risk that the Company may not be able to resolve disputes with the partner.  The Company may encounter unanticipated operating issues, financial results, or compliance and reputational risks related to these investments.  The Company mitigates this risk using controls and policies related to joint venture formation, governance (including board of directors’ representation), merger and acquisition integration management, and harmonization of joint venture policies with the Company’s policies and controls.

The Company’s information technology (IT) systems, processes, and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches, or failures which may affect the Company’s ability to conduct its business.

The Company’s operations rely on certain key IT systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data connectivity, information, and services for internal and external users.  These interactions include, but are not limited to: Ordering and managing materials from suppliers; risk management activities; converting raw materials to finished products; inventory management; shipping products to customers; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; human resources benefits and payroll management; and complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements.  The Company is also in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing business transformation program, which is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment.  Increased IT security and social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the Company’s IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company’s third party data.  The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data.  Compliance with and interpretation of data privacy regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation implemented in 2018, continues to evolve and any violation could subject the Company to legal claims, regulatory penalties, and damage to its reputation.  The Company has put in place security measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber-based attacks, and has instituted control procedures for cyber security incident responses and disaster recovery plans for its critical systems.  In addition, the Company monitors this risk on an ongoing basis to detect and correct any breaches, and reports metrics on the quality of the Company’s data security efforts and control environment to the highest level of management and to the Board of Directors.  However, if the Company’s IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Company’s disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the Company may suffer significant interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, actual or threatened legal actions, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the Company’s revenues, operating results, and financial condition.

The Company may fail to realize the benefits or experience delays in the execution of its growth strategy, encompassing organic and inorganic initiatives, outside the U.S. and in businesses where the Company does not currently have a large presence.

As the Company executes its growth strategy, through both organic and inorganic growth, it may encounter risks which could result in increased costs, decreased revenues, and delayed synergies.  Recent investments outside the U.S. include Neovia, certain assets of Brazil-based Algar Agro, Protexin, and Rodelle, Inc.  Growth in new geographies outside the U.S. can expose the Company to volatile economic, political, and regulatory risks that may negatively impact its operations and ability to achieve its growth strategy.  Expanding businesses where the Company has limited presence may expose the Company to risks related to the inability to identify an appropriate partner or target and favorable terms, inability to retain/hire strategic talent, or integration risks that may require significant management resources that would have otherwise been available for ongoing growth or operational initiatives.  Acquisitions may involve unanticipated delays, costs, and other problems.  Due diligence performed prior to the acquisition may not identify a material liability or issue that could impact the Company's reputation or adversely affect results of operations resulting in a reduction of the anticipated acquisition benefits.  Additionally, acquisitions may involve integration risks such as:  internal control effectiveness, system integration risks, the risk of impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangibles, ability to retain acquired employees, and other unanticipated risks.

PROPERTIES

The Company owns or leases, under operating leases, the following processing plants and procurement facilities:

The Company’s operations are such that most products are efficiently processed near the source of raw materials.  Consequently, the Company has many plants strategically located in agricultural commodity producing areas.  The annual volume of commodities processed will vary depending upon availability of raw materials and demand for finished products.  The Company also owns approximately


warehouses and terminals primarily used as bulk storage facilities and


innovation centers.  Warehouses, terminals, corporate, and sales offices are not included in the tables above.  Processing plants and procurement facilities owned or leased by unconsolidated joint ventures are also not included in the tables above.

To enhance the efficiency of transporting large quantities of raw materials and finished products between the Company’s procurement facilities and processing plants and also the final delivery of products to its customers around the world, the Company owns approximately

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 in Item 8 for information on income tax matters), and class actions.  The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of its business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution with the applicable government authorities.  The outcomes of these matters are not within the Company's complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.  If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice.  See Note 20 in Item 8 for information on the Company’s legal proceedings.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Company Overview

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s vision is to be the most admired global agribusiness and nutrition company while creating value and growing responsibly.  The Company’s growth strategy is spread across its five key growth platforms:  Taste, Nutrition, Animal Nutrition, Health and Wellness, and Carbohydrates.  The Company desires to execute this vision and these strategies by conducting its business in accordance with its core values of operating with integrity, treating others with respect, achieving excellence, being resourceful, displaying teamwork, and being responsible.

The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities, products, and ingredients.  The Company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in more than


countries.  The Company also processes corn, oilseeds, and wheat into products for food, animal feed, chemical and energy uses.  The Company also engages in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of specialty products including natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products, and other specialty food and feed ingredients.  The Company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities.

The Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable business segments: Origination, Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.  Financial information with respect to the Company’s reportable business segments is set forth in Note 17 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect changes in its operating structure.  The Company's new segments are Origination (formerly Agricultural Services), Oilseeds (formerly Oilseeds Processing), Carbohydrate Solutions (formerly Corn Processing), and Nutrition (formerly Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients).  The European origination business previously reported in Oilseeds is now managed by leaders in Origination to better coordinate continental trading activities.  Carbohydrate Solutions now includes the results of ADM Milling, which were previously reported in Origination.  In addition, the Company also moved the segment reporting of its renewable chemicals business from Carbohydrate Solutions to Oilseeds effective July 1, 2018.  Nutrition now includes the results of Animal Nutrition and certain product lines previously reported in Carbohydrate Solutions as well as certain product lines previously reported in Oilseeds.

Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

The Company’s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include:

•

the investment in June 2018 of a 50% interest in SoyVen, a joint venture with Cargill to provide soybean meal and oil for customers in Egypt;

•

the acquisition in June 2018 of a 50% equity stake in the starches and sweeteners business of Russian-based Aston Foods and Food Ingredients;

•

the sale in July 2018 of the Company’s oilseeds operations in Bolivia to Inversiones Piuranas S.A.;

•

the acquisition in August 2018 of Probiotics International Limited, a British-based provider of probiotic supplements for human, pet, and production-animal uses;

•

the acquisition in August 2018 of Rodelle Inc., a premium originator, processor and supplier of vanilla products;

•

the announcement in October 2018 of the launch of GrainBridge LLC, a 50% joint venture with Cargill that will develop and offer revolutionary new digital tools to help farmers make more informed grain marketing decisions based on personalized production economics;

•

the acquisition in January 2019 of Neovia, a French-based global provider of value-added animal nutrition solutions, with


production facilities and a presence in


countries;


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

•

the announcement in January 2019 of an agreement to purchase Florida Chemical Company, one of the world's largest providers of citrus oils and ingredients, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close in the first quarter of 2019; and

•

the announcement in January 2019 of an agreement to purchase the remaining

50%

interest owned by Invivo in Gleadell Agriculture Ltd., a current joint venture with Invivo, which is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.

The Company executes its strategic vision through three pillars:  Optimize the Core, Drive Efficiencies, and Expand Strategically, all supported by its Readiness culture.  During 2018, the Company launched Readiness to drive new efficiencies and improve the customer experience in the Company’s existing businesses through a combination of data and analytics, process simplification and standardization, and behavioral and cultural change; building upon its earlier 1ADM and operational excellence programs.  Readiness will also support the execution of the Company's growth strategies across its five key growth platforms:  Taste, Nutrition, Animal Nutrition, Health and Wellness, and Carbohydrates.

Operating Performance Indicators

The Company’s Origination and Oilseeds operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials.  Therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold.  Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit.

The Company’s Carbohydrate Solutions operations and Nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials.  However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold.  Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.

The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than


countries.  For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency.  Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods.  For the majority of the Company’s business activities in Brazil and Argentina, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency.  Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar.

The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, segment operating profit, return on invested capital, EBITDA, economic value added, manufacturing expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses.  The Company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Year Ended December 31,


Compared to Year Ended December 31,


As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results.  In 2018, markets were volatile amid escalating global trade tensions including the announcement of tariffs on Chinese imports of U.S. soybeans.  In Origination, strong demand for feedstuffs in light of weather conditions in Northern Europe resulted in higher sales volumes and margins in destination markets, and strong basis positions across commodities resulted in higher margins.  In Oilseeds, dry conditions in Argentina resulted in a smaller soybean crop, which combined with continued good global meal demand, resulted in strong global crushing margins and volumes.  South American origination volumes and margins benefited from stronger farmer selling.  Demand and margins for refined oil remained solid, and biodiesel margins improved.  Excess global peanut supply resulted in weak peanut margins.  In Carbohydrate Solutions, global demand and prices for starches and sweeteners remained solid in North America while co-product prices were stable.  U.S. ethanol industry production remained at high levels.  Although ethanol demand remained strong both in North America and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol's continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer, margins continue to remain under pressure.  Nutrition benefited from strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems and from strong demand for and favorable margin development in certain non-flavor food businesses.

Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased

13%

or

$0.2 billion

, to

$1.8 billion

.   Segment operating profit increased

29%

or

$0.7 billion

, to

$3.3 billion

.  Included in segment operating profit in the current year was a net charge of

$89 million

consisting of asset impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges and a net gain on sales of assets and businesses.  Included in segment operating profit in the prior year was a net charge of

$134 million

consisting of asset impairment and restructuring charges, a net gain on sales of assets and businesses, and corn hedge timing effects.  Adjusted segment operating profit increased

$0.7 billion

to

$3.4 billion

due to an increase in sales prices and volumes of corn and meal, improved margins in Origination, Oilseeds, and Nutrition, and the benefits of the 2017 biodiesel tax credit which was approved and received in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by lower ethanol margins.  Corporate results were a net charge of

$1.2 billion

in the current year compared to

$0.9 billion

in the prior year. Corporate results in the current year included a pension settlement charge of

$117 million

, a

$49 million

charge related to a discontinued software project, restructuring charges of

$24 million

primarily related to the reorganization of IT services, and a credit of

$18 million

from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a credit of

$2 million

in the prior year.  Corporate results in the prior year also included

$54 million

of restructuring charges primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company's global workforce.

Income taxes of

$245 million

increased

$238 million

due to a higher effective tax rate and higher earnings before income taxes.  The Company’s effective tax rate for


increased to

11.9%

compared to

0.4%

for


due primarily to the low rate in 2017 that was impacted by favorable tax adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act totaling

$379 million

.  The effective tax rate for the current year also included the final effects of the U.S. tax reform and the 2017 biodiesel tax credit recorded in the first quarter of 2018, along with certain favorable discrete tax items netting to a favorable

$74 million

.

Analysis of Statements of Earnings

Processed volumes by product for the years ended December 31,


and


are as follows (in metric tons):

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. Processed volumes of oilseeds increased due to increasing global demand for oilseed products, particularly meal, and higher crushing volumes in North America due to the reduced soybean crop in Argentina.  The overall decrease in corn is primarily related to decreased current year processing after the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and production issues in the Decatur, Illinois corn complex in 2018.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Revenues by segment for the years ended December 31,


and


are as follows:

Revenues and cost of products sold in commodity merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes.  In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds and Origination, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.

Revenues increased

$3.5 billion

or

6%

, to

$64.3 billion

due principally to higher sales prices (

$2.3 billion

) and higher sales volumes (

$1.2 billion

).   The increase in sales prices and volumes was due primarily to increases in corn and soybean meal.  Origination revenues increased

4%

to

$25.1 billion

due to higher sales prices (

$2.1 billion

), partially offset by lower sales volumes (

$1.2 billion

).  Oilseeds revenues increased

11%

to

$24.8 billion

due to higher sales volumes (

$2.0 billion

) and higher sales prices (

$0.4 billion

).  Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased

1%

to

$10.3 billion

due to lower sales prices (

$0.2 billion

), partially offset by higher sales volumes (

$0.1 billion

).  Nutrition revenues increased

8%

to

$3.8 billion

due to higher sales volumes (

$0.3 billion

).

Cost of products sold increased

$2.9 billion

to

$60.2 billion

due principally to higher sales volumes and higher prices for commodities.  Included in cost of products sold was a credit of

$18 million

from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to

$2 million

in the prior year.  Manufacturing expenses increased

$0.2 billion

to

$5.4 billion

due principally to increased energy cost, railroad maintenance expense that has an offsetting benefit in income tax expense, and other individually insignificant increases in certain expense categories.

Foreign currency translation impacts increased both revenues and cost of products sold by

$0.4 billion

.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Gross profit increased

$0.7 billion

or

19%

, to

$4.2 billion

.  Higher results in Crushing and Origination (

$490 million

), Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other (

$99 million

), Merchandising and Handling (

$204 million

), and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients (

$76 million

) were partially offset by lower results in Bioproducts (

$103 million

) and Other (

$36 million

).  These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 33.  The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves had a positive impact on gross profit of

$18 million

compared to

$2 million

in the prior year.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased

9%

to

$2.2 billion

due principally to higher performance-related compensation accruals and increased pension and project-related expenses.

Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased

$2 million

to

$171 million

.  Current year charges consisted of

$56 million

of impairment of certain long-lived assets, a

$12 million

impairment of an equity investment, a

$21 million

impairment related to a long-term financing receivable, and

$9 million

of other individually insignificant impairment and restructuring charges (presented as specified items within segment operating profit), and a

$49 million

charge related to a discontinued software project,

$18 million

of restructuring charges related to the reorganization of IT services and

$6 million

of individually insignificant restructuring charges in Corporate.   Prior year charges consisted of $63 million of asset impairments related to the reconfiguration of the Company's Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex, $20 million of asset impairments related to the closure of a facility, and $36 million of several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $54 million of restructuring charges in Corporate primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company's global workforce.

Interest expense increased

$34 million

to

$364 million

primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term debt and higher borrowings.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased

$62 million

to

$518 million

due to earnings from a new equity investment and higher earnings from the Company’s equity investments in CIP and Olenex, partially offset by lower earnings from other equity investments.

Other expense - net of

$101 million

increased

$111 million

from net income of

$10 million

.  Current year expense included foreign exchange losses and a non-cash pension settlement charge of

$117 million

related to the purchase of a group annuity contract that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain U.S. salaried retirees under the Company's ADM Retirement Plan.  These expenses were partially offset by gains on disposals of businesses, an equity investment, and individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, and other income.    Prior year net income included gains related to the sale of the crop risk services business and disposals of other individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business, changes in contingent settlement provisions, a charge related to the early redemption of the Company's $559 million notes due March 15, 2018, and foreign exchange losses.


Item 7.

Segment operating profit, adjusted segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure), and earnings before income taxes for the years ended December 31,


and


are as follows:

(1)

Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit excluding the listed specified items.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Origination operating profit increased

35%

.  Merchandising and Handling was up significantly year-over-year.  Global trade delivered strong results due to increased volumes, strong margins, and improved opportunities in the soybean and feedstuff value chain.  North American grain was up due to improved margins and higher volumes.  Transportation was up due primarily to higher freight rates.

Oilseeds operating profit increased

79%

.  Crushing and Origination results increased due to a strong global demand and margin environment.  The reduced soybean crop in Argentina combined with continued good global meal demand resulted in strong crushing margins and volumes.  South America saw strong origination volumes and improving margins as farmer selling accelerated.  Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other results were higher mainly due to the 2017 biodiesel tax credit of approximately

$120 million

which was approved and received in the first quarter of 2018, solid biodiesel results, and higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Olenex, partially offset by weaker peanut shelling margins primarily caused by large peanut inventories and difficult market conditions.  Asia results increased due to higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Wilmar.

Carbohydrate Solutions operating profit decreased

12%

.  Starches and Sweeteners results decreased due to lower margins and volumes in liquid sweeteners mainly due to production issues in the Decatur, Illinois corn complex partially offset by improved results from starches and dry sweeteners.  Bioproducts results were down as near record industry fuel ethanol inventories pressured margins and production issues in the Decatur, IL corn complex increased costs, partially offset by effective ethanol risk management.

Nutrition operating profit increased

9%

.  Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients results were up due to improved earnings across the segment and higher sales volumes related to contributions from new acquisitions and organic growth.  In Wild Flavors, an improved portfolio mix boosted sales and margins.  Health and Wellness improved driven largely by increased contributions from bioactives.  Specialty Ingredients was up due to improved volumes and margins in proteins and increased sales in fibers partially offset by lower results in polyols.  Animal Nutrition was down due to operational issues in Decatur, IL that constrained lysine production volumes and increased manufacturing costs partially offset by improved premix and commercial feed margins.

Other operating profit increased

14%

primarily due to stronger results from its futures commission brokerage business due to higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower underwriting results from the Company’s captive insurance operations during the first half of 2018.

Corporate results are as follows:


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Corporate results were a net charge of

$1.2 billion

in the current year compared to

$0.9 billion

in the prior year.  The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of

$18 million

in the current year compared to a credit of

$2 million

in the prior year.  Interest expense - net increased

$11 million

due to higher interest rates on short-term debt and higher borrowings, partially offset by interest income related to a tax credit and lower-tax related expense.  Unallocated corporate costs increased

$190 million

due principally to higher performance-related compensation accruals, increased pension and project-related expenses, and railroad maintenance expense that has an offsetting benefit in income tax expense.  Acquisition-related expenses in the current year related to expenses and losses on foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge certain acquisitions.  Loss on debt extinguishment in the prior period related to the early redemption of the $559 million aggregate principal amount of 5.45% notes due on March 15, 2018.  Impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges in the current year included a pension settlement charge of

$117 million

, a

$49 million

charge related to a discontinued software project, and restructuring charges of

$24 million

primarily related to the reorganization of IT services compared to restructuring charges related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company’s global workforce of

$54 million

in the prior year.  Other charges decreased

$32 million

primarily due to improved results in the Company’s investment in CIP and lower non-service cost related pension expenses.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance.  These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of specified items.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items.  The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.  Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted, where applicable, for specified items.

Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability.  Adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS, earnings before income taxes, and segment operating profit, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Year Ended December 31,


Compared to Year Ended December 31,


As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results.  In Origination, U.S. export competitiveness was strong during the first half of 2017 but weakened during the second half due to the large crops in South America.  Overall low market volatility continued due to surplus in the global market.  In Carbohydrate Solutions, demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid in North America while co-product prices were stable.  Ethanol continues to face a challenging environment.  Although ethanol demand remained strong both in North America and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol's continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer, U.S. industry ethanol production also remained at high levels which limited margins. Global oilseeds processing volumes remained strong, but ample supply of competing proteins and abundance of Argentine meal and oil in world markets pressured margins.  Slow selling by farmers in Brazil continues to depress grain origination margins despite strong export volumes.  While demand and margins for refined oil remained solid across all regions, uncertainty surrounding the U.S. biodiesel tax credit has negatively impacted biodiesel margins.  Nutrition benefited from strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems, but continued to be adversely affected by start-up costs and margin pressure in certain non-flavor food ingredient markets.

Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased $0.3 billion to $1.6 billion.   Segment operating profit decreased $0.2 billion to $2.5 billion.  Included in segment operating profit in 2017 was a net charge of $134 million consisting of a net gain on sales of assets and businesses, impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges, and corn hedge timing effects.  Included in segment operating profit in 2016 was income of $81 million consisting of  a net gain on sales of assets and businesses/revaluation, impairment and restructuring charges, and corn hedge timing effects.  Adjusted segment operating profit increased $47 million to $2.7 billion due to solid results in Carbohydrate Solutions, partially offset by weaker South American origination margins, lower soybean crush margins, and weaker results in some specialty ingredients.  Corporate results were a net charge of $927 million in 2017 compared to $882 million in 2016. Corporate results in 2017 included a credit of $2 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a charge of $19 million in 2016.

Income taxes decreased $527 million due to lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate.  The Company’s effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to 0.4% compared to 29.3% for 2016 due primarily to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”).  Excluding the impact of the Act, the Company's effective tax rate for 2017 would have decreased from 29.3% to approximately 24.0% due primarily to the impact of changes in discrete tax items, including the favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position related to a 2014 acquisition and return to provision adjustments in the current year, partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings and the expiration of U.S. tax credits, including the biodiesel credit, at the end of 2016 (see Note 13 in Item 8 for more information).

Analysis of Statements of Earnings

Processed volumes by product for the years ended December 31,


and


are as follows (in metric tons):

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. Processed volumes of oilseeds increased due to the strong demand environment for soybean meal and canola oil.  The overall increase in corn is due to the strong demand environment for ethanol, partially offset by the production disruption in one of the Company’s plants due to a water main break in the first quarter and the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Revenues by segment for the years ended December 31,


and


are as follows:

Revenues and cost of products sold in commodity merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes.  In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds and Origination, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.

Revenues decreased $1.5 billion, or 2%, to $60.8 billion due to lower sales volumes ($1.4 billion) and lower average sales prices ($0.1 billion).  The decrease in sales volumes was due principally to a decrease in volumes of unprocessed commodities, in particular volumes of soybeans, corn, rapeseed, and wheat.  Origination revenues decreased 6% to $24.1 billion due to lower sales volumes ($1.5 billion) and lower average sales prices ($0.1 billion).  Oilseeds revenues increased 2% to $22.4 billion due to higher sales volumes (

$0.4 billion

).  Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased 3% to $10.4 billion due to lower sales volumes (

$0.3 billion

).  Nutrition revenues of $3.5 billion were comparable to 2016.

Cost of products sold decreased $1.4 billion to $57.3 billion due principally to lower sales volumes.   Included in cost of products sold is a credit of $2 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to a charge of $19 million in 2016.  Manufacturing expenses increased $0.1 billion to $5.2 billion due to increased expenses for energy, operating and maintenance supplies, and contracted labor, and higher salaries and benefits.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Gross profit decreased $0.1 billion or 3%, to $3.5 billion.  Lower results in soybean processing (

$159 million

) and grain origination (

$86 million

) were partially offset by higher results in canola processing ($41 million), sweeteners and starches (

$44 million

), and animal nutrition (

$39 million

).   These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 40.  The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves had a $2 million positive impact on gross profit compared to a negative impact of $19 million in 2016.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $2.0 billion were comparable to 2016.  Expenses in 2017 included increased salaries and benefits cost related to further investments in the Company’s business transformation, IT, research and development, and innovation initiatives.  Expenses in 2016 included expenses related to the settlement of a legal matter.

Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs increased $118 million to $173 million.  Charges in 2017 consisted of $63 million of asset impairments related to the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex, $20 million of asset impairments primarily related to the closure of a facility, $36 million of several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $54 million of restructuring charges in Corporate primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company’s global workforce.  Charges in 2016 included $32 million of individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges presented as specified items within segment operating profit, $11 million of software impairment in Corporate, $6 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company's investment in two available for sale equity securities in Corporate, and $6 million of individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges in Corporate.

Interest expense increased $37 million to $330 million primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term debt, the issuance of the $1 billion fixed-rate notes in August 2016, and interest related to an amended foreign income tax, partially offset by the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017.  Interest expense in 2016 also included a credit of $8 million for the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $164 million to $456 million primarily due to higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Wilmar resulting from the increased ownership stake in and higher results from Wilmar and improved results from the Company’s equity investment in CIP, partially offset by losses from a new equity investment and decreased earnings resulting from the disposal of an equity investment.

Other income - net decreased $110 million to $37 million.  Income in 2016 included realized additional consideration related to the sale of the Company's equity investment in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. in December 2012, recovery of loss provisions and gain related to the sale of the Company's Brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, a gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets.   Income in 2017 included gains related to the sale of the crop risk services business and disposals of other individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business, changes in contingent settlement provisions, a charge related to the full redemption of the Company's $559 million notes due March 15, 2018, and foreign exchange losses.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Operating profit by segment and earnings before income taxes for the years ended December 31,


and


are as follows:

(1)

Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit excluding the above specified items.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Origination operating profit increased 12%.  Merchandising and Handling operating results increased due to improved Global Trade execution and strong destination marketing volume growth.  Merchandising and Handling results also included a gain related to a confidential legal settlement, and a $42 million net recovery of property damage costs and business interruption losses related to the Company's New Orleans, Louisiana export facility.  Transportation results decreased due to river conditions and lower barge freight volumes and margins.

Oilseeds operating profit decreased 3%.  Crushing and Origination operating profit decreased from the prior year.  Higher softseed results in North America and Europe were more than offset by weaker soybean crush margins due to ample supply of alternative proteins competing with soybean meal.  In addition, improved South American soybean crushing results were more than offset by weak grain origination margins throughout the year.  Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other operating profit declined due to weaker biodiesel and specialty oils margins partially offset by higher results in South American packaged oils and the global peanut business.  Asia results increased on higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Wilmar due to the increased ownership stake in and higher results from Wilmar.

Carbohydrate Solutions operating profit increased 8%.  Starches and Sweeteners operating profit increased due to improved domestic demand and higher volumes and margins from the international business.  Bioproducts profit increased due to higher trading results partially offset by slightly lower ethanol margins.

Nutrition operating profit increased 14%.  Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients operating profit increased due the continuing strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems across all regions, partially offset by lower results in specialty ingredients due in part to operational start-up costs.  Animal Nutrition operating profit increased due to improved lysine margins partially offset by lower volumes caused by a mild winter.

Other operating profit decreased 62% primarily due to losses from the Company's captive insurance operations and lower results from its futures commission brokerage business.  Results in 2017 included settlement of insurance claims from the Company's Origination segment totaling $50 million related to the New Orleans, Louisiana export facility.

Corporate results are as follows:


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Corporate results were a net charge of $927 million in 2017 compared to $882 million in 2016.  The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of $2 million in 2017 compared to a charge of $19 million in 2016.  Interest expense - net increased $28 million due principally to higher interest rates on short-term debt, the issuance of $1 billion fixed-rate debt in August 2016, and interest related to an amended foreign income tax return, partially offset by the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017 and the absence of the original Harvest Innovation adjustment of buy-out liability in May 2016. Unallocated corporate costs increased $13 million due principally to increased investments in the Company’s business transformation, IT, research and development, and innovation initiatives partially offset by the absence of the railroad maintenance expense in 2016.  Loss on debt extinguishment related to the early redemption of the Company’s $559 million aggregate principal amount of 5.45% notes due on March 15, 2018.  Asset impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges in 2017 related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company’s global workforce compared to charges in 2016 which  consisted of legal settlement costs and legal fees, a software impairment charge, other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company’s investments in two available for sale equity securities, and other asset impairment and restructuring charges.  Post-retirement benefit adjustment related to the U.S. retiree medical benefit curtailment gain.  Loss on sale of asset related to the sale of an investment, partially offset by a gain related to a U.S. retiree medical benefit plan curtailment.  Other charges increased $12 million due principally to lower results from the Company's equity investment in CIP.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of the Company’s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures.  The primary source of funds to finance the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility.  In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets.

Cash used in operating activities was

$4.8 billion

for


compared to

$6.0 billion

in


.  Working capital changes, including the increase in deferred consideration, decreased cash by

$7.5 billion

in the current year compared to

$7.9 billion

in the prior year.  Trade receivables increased

$0.4 billion

due to higher revenues.  Inventories decreased

$0.2 billion

due to lower inventory quantities.

Increase in deferred consideration in securitized receivables of

$7.8 billion

and

$8.2 billion

in


and


, respectively, was offset by the same amount of net consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for selling trade receivables, which were previously classified as operating activities in the prior year, that are now classified as investing activities in accordance with the amended guidance of Topic 230.

Cash provided by investing activities was

$6.6 billion

this year compared to

$7.3 billion

last year.  Capital expenditures and net assets of businesses acquired were

$0.8 billion

and

$0.5 billion

, respectively, this year compared to

$1.0 billion

and

$0.2 billion

, respectively last year.  Proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of

$0.2 billion

in the current year were comparable to the prior year.  There were immaterial marketable securities sales transactions this year compared to sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $0.4 billion in the prior year.  Investments in and advances to affiliates of

$0.2 billion

in the current year related to the joint venture with Cargill and investment in Aston Foods compared to

$0.3 billion

of additional investment in Wilmar in the prior year.  Net consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for selling trade receivables was

$7.8 billion

and

$8.2 billion

in


and


, respectively.

Cash provided by financing activities was

$0.2 billion

this year compared to a use of

$1.0 billion

last year.  Long-term debt borrowings in the current year consisted of the

€650 million

(

$744 million

as of December 31, 2018) aggregate principal amount of 1.0% Notes issued on September 12, 2018 and the December 3, 2018 issuance of

$600 million

and

$400 million

aggregate principal amounts of

4.5%

and

3.375%

Notes, respectively.  Long-term debt borrowings in the prior year related to the

$500 million

aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Notes issued on September 14, 2017.  Long-term debt payments in the current year were

$30 million

compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year which primarily related to the full redemption of the $559 million notes due in 2018 and the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017.  The Company issued debt in the current year for general corporate expenses and to pay down commercial paper borrowings.  Commercial paper payments in the current year were

$0.7 billion

compared to borrowings of

$0.7 billion

in the prior year.  Share repurchases in the current year were

$0.1 billion

compared to

$0.8 billion

in the prior year.

At

December 31, 2018

, the Company had

$2.0 billion

of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of

1.7

to 1.  Included in working capital is

$5.6 billion

of readily marketable commodity inventories.  At

December 31, 2018

, the Company’s capital resources included shareholders’ equity of

$19.0 billion

and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling

$10.4 billion

, of which

$8.9 billion

was unused.  The Company’s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders’ equity) was

29%

at

December 31, 2018

and

27%

at

December 31, 2017

.  The Company uses this ratio as a measure of the Company’s long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  The Company’s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders’ equity) was

25%

at

December 31, 2018

and

27%

at

December 31, 2017

.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit,

$5.0 billion

supported the combined U.S. and European commercial paper borrowing programs, against which there was

no

commercial paper outstanding at

December 31, 2018

.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had

$2.0 billion

of cash and cash equivalents,

$0.4 billion

of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested.  Based on the Company’s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of

$5.2 billion

, the Company has asserted that these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers.  The Programs provide the Company with up to

$1.8 billion

in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expands the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 19 in Item 8 for more information and disclosures on the Programs).  As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company utilized

$1.5 billion

of its facility under the Programs.  The Programs are due to terminate during the first half of 2019.  However, the Company currently expects to extend these Programs upon termination.

On November 5, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019.  The Company has acquired approximately

87.9

million shares under this program as of December 31, 2018.

The Company expects capital expenditures of

$0.9 billion

to

$1.0 billion

during 2019.  In 2019, the Company expects additional cash outlays of approximately

$0.8 billion

in dividends.

The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of

December 31, 2018

.

The three major credit rating agencies have maintained the Company’s credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable outlooks.

In January 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Neovia, a French-based global provider of value-added animal nutrition solutions, with 72 production facilities and a presence in 25 countries, for

$1.8 billion

(

€1.5 billion

).  The Company funded the transaction using operating cash flows and other sources of liquidity.

Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future.  The following table sets forth the Company’s significant future obligations by time period.  Purchases include commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” energy-related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Company’s normal business activities.  The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of

$107 million

as of

December 31, 2018

as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement.  Where applicable, information included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes is cross-referenced in this table.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

(1)

Includes pension contributions of

$27 million

for fiscal 2019.  The Company is unable to estimate the amount of pension contributions beyond fiscal year 2019.  For more information concerning the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans, see Note 15 in Item 8.

At

December 31, 2018

, the Company estimates it will spend approximately

$1.3 billion

through fiscal year 2023 to complete currently approved capital projects which are not included in the table above.

The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of

$1.7 billion

at

December 31, 2018

which are not included in the table above.

The Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments.  The Company’s liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation.  The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs

Since March 2012, the Company has had an accounts receivable securitization program with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers.  In March 2014, the Company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers.  See Note 19 of Item 8 for more information about these programs.

Synthetic Leasing Program

The Company is a party to lease agreements under synthetic leasing programs for certain of its U.S. barge and tugboat assets with expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2024.  The agreements are accounted for as operating leases, such that the rent expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings.  As of

December 31, 2018

, outstanding lease balances, including the value of the underlying assets of

$164 million

, were off-balance sheet.  These agreements provide the Company with the right to use these assets for specified periods in exchange for an obligation to make rental payments.  The future lease payments pertaining to these lease agreements are included in the contractual obligations table in Item 7.  These leasing programs are utilized primarily to diversify funding sources and to retain flexibility.  The Company recorded

$10 million

, $10 million, and $5 million of rent expense pertaining to synthetic lease payments for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


, respectively.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies

The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Company’s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  These estimates and judgments are based on the Company’s historical experience and management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Certain of the Company’s accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Company’s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  Management has discussed with the Company’s Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.  Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Company’s financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements - Inventories and Commodity Derivatives

Certain of the Company’s inventory and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of

December 31, 2018

are valued at estimated fair values, including

$4.5 billion

of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories,

$0.6 billion

of derivative assets,

$0.8 billion

of derivative liabilities, and

$0.6 billion

of inventory-related payables.  Commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward fixed-price purchase and sale contracts for agricultural commodities.  Merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.  Management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  The Company’s inventory and derivative commodity fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Level 3 fair value measurements of approximately

$1.7 billion

of assets and

$0.3 billion

of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.  For more information concerning amounts reported as Level 3, see Note 4 in Item 8.  Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.  Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.

Derivatives – Designated Hedging Activities

The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the purchase or sales price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to hedge the purchase price of the Company’s anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to hedge the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol.  Assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.  If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of revenues and/or cost of products sold.  See Note 5 in Item 8 for additional information.

Investments in Affiliates

The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence.  These investments are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  Generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.  However, the Company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including, but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements.  If management used a different accounting method for these investments, then the amount of earnings from affiliates the Company recognizes may materially differ.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  These standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.  The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.  For example, the Company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in Brazil and Argentina, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company.  The Company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions (see Note 13 in Item 8 for additional information).

Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns where the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Company’s income statement.  The realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  The Company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.  Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely.  During


, the Company increased valuation allowances by approximately

$25 million

primarily related to certain realized foreign capital losses.  To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and the Company’s share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately

$10.5 billion

at

December 31, 2018

, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, included a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings. As a result, the Company recorded a

$369 million

provisional impact of the transition tax and a

$220 million

beneficial impact on reserves previously established under Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 740-30,

Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas

, or a net provisional impact of

$149 million

.  The Company performed a quarterly review of the provisional tax liability recorded in 2017 as new guidance on the Act was issued in 2018.  The Company finalized its calculation of the transition tax and recorded a tax benefit of

$29 million

in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of pending Treasury Regulations on the Company’s transition tax calculation, and will record any adjustment in 2019.  The Company elected to pay the one-time transition tax over eight years.  Because the Company’s undistributed foreign earnings and outside basis differences inherent in foreign entities continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, no income taxes have been provided.  It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities.

The Act also contains new provisions related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) and Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) which are effective for fiscal year 2018.  The Company made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI as a period cost.  During 2018, U.S. tax authorities issued proposed Treasury Regulations addressing some of the tax reform items that were effective in 2018.  Once final Treasury Regulations are issued, the Company will record the impact of any changes during 2019.  It is also reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing their current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the Act.  The additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, may affect significant deductions and income inclusions and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net income or cash flow.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Property, Plant, and Equipment and Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs

The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  This business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.  Both the availability of the Company’s raw materials and the demand for the Company’s finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Company’s raw materials and finished products.  Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Company’s assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its facilities.  The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.  These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.  Management evaluates the Company’s property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  Assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.  During the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


, impairment charges for property, plant, and equipment were

$100 million

,

$101 million

, and

$17 million

, respectively.  Asset abandonment and impairment charges in 2018 included a $49 million discontinued software project (see Note 18 in Item 8 for additional information).

Business Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805,

Business Combinations,

as amended

.

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill.  When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.  Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates.  Although management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, actual results may differ.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.  The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

, which permits, but does not require, a company to qualitatively assess indicators of a reporting unit's fair value.  If after completing the qualitative assessment, a company believes it is likely that a reporting unit is impaired, a discounted cash flow analysis is prepared to estimate fair value.  Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of


to


years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying values may not be fully recoverable.  The Company recorded impairment charges totaling

$9 million

related to customer lists and

$11 million

related to computer software during the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively.  There were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended

December 31, 2017

(see Note 18 in Item 8 for more information).  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.  The Company provides certain eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with subsidized postretirement health care coverage or Health Care Reimbursement Accounts.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.  These estimates and assumptions are based on the Company’s historical experience combined with management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.  If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.

The Company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial losses.  Under the corridor approach, net unrecognized actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets are amortized over future periods.  For plans with little to no active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy of the participants.  For plans with active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average service period of the active participants.  The amortization periods range from


to


years for the Company's defined benefit pension plans and from


to


years for the Company's postretirement benefit plans.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The market risk inherent in the Company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Company’s net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below.

Commodities

The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in customer preferences and standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.

The Company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for, and produced in, its business operations, by entering into derivative and non-derivative contracts which reduce the Company’s overall short or long commodity position.  Additionally, the Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.

The Company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sales contracts, energy and freight contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements, net of sales.

The fair value of the Company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period, where available, or utilizing a close proxy.  The Company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure, which consist of volumetric limits, and value-at-risk (VaR) limits. VaR measures the potential loss, at a 95% confidence level, that could be incurred over a one year period.  Volumetric limits are monitored daily and VaR calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly.

In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming no correlations) over a one year period using VaR, sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices.  The highest, lowest, and average weekly position for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10% adverse price change is as follows:


Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued)

The change in fair value of the average position was principally the result of an increase in prices underlying the weekly commodity position partially offset by a decrease in quantities.

Currencies

The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than


countries.  For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency.  To reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real currencies.  These currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur.  The Company does not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.  The currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange-traded futures contracts, and over-the-counter options.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material.

The amount the Company considers indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year-end exchange rates is

$8.7 billion

and

$8.2 billion

(

$10.5 billion

and

$9.4 billion

at historical rates) at

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively.  The increase is due to the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of

$1.1 billion

partially offset by the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar of

$0.6 billion

.  The potential loss in fair value, which would principally be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income, resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is

$870 million

and

$820 million

for

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively.  Actual results may differ.

Interest

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long-term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates.  Actual results may differ.

The increase in fair value of long-term debt at

December 31, 2018

is primarily due to increased borrowings.

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business

The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities products, and ingredients.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company consolidates all entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs), in which it has a controlling financial interest.  For VIEs, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary as defined under the applicable accounting standard.  Investments in affiliates, including VIEs through which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities, are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted, where appropriate, for basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  The Company’s portion of the results of certain affiliates and results of certain VIEs are included using the most recent available financial statements.  In each case, the financial statements are within 93 days of the Company’s year-end and are consistent from period to period.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

The Company classified

$7.8 billion

of cash inflows from net consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for selling trade receivables as investing instead of operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2018

in accordance with the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 230,

Statement of Cash Flows

.  Prior period amounts have been conformed to the current presentation, which resulted in a decrease of

$8.2 billion

and

$8.1 billion

in total cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding increase in cash provided by investing activities for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

The Company classified

$(10) million

of non-service components of net benefit cost (income) as other (income) expense - net in its consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended

December 31, 2018

, as a result of the adoption of the amended guidance of ASC Topic 715,

Compensation - Retirement Benefits

.  Amounts previously reported in cost of goods sold of

$12 million

and

$(1) million

for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, and in selling, general, and administrative expenses of

$15 million

and

$(1) million

for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, have been reclassified to other (income) expense - net to conform to the current presentation (see Note 12).

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect changes in its operating structure.  The Company's   new segments are Origination (formerly Agricultural Services), Oilseeds (formerly Oilseeds Processing), Carbohydrate Solutions (formerly Corn Processing), and Nutrition (formerly Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients).  The European origination business previously reported in Oilseeds is now managed by leaders in Origination to better coordinate continental trading activities.  Carbohydrate Solutions now includes the results of ADM Milling, which were previously reported in Origination.  In addition, the Company also moved the segment reporting of its renewable chemicals business from Carbohydrate Solutions to Oilseeds effective July 1, 2018.  Nutrition now includes the results of Animal Nutrition and certain product lines previously reported in Carbohydrate Solutions, as well as certain product lines previously reported in Oilseeds.

Throughout this annual report on Form 10-K, prior period results have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all non-segregated, highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Segregated Cash and Investments

The Company segregates certain cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances in accordance with regulatory requirements, commodity exchange requirements, and insurance arrangements.  These balances represent deposits received from customers of the Company’s registered futures commission merchant and commodity brokerage services, cash margins and securities pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses, and cash pledged as security under certain insurance arrangements.  Segregated cash and investments also include restricted cash collateral for the various insurance programs of the Company’s captive insurance business.    To the degree these segregated balances are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, they are considered restricted cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows.

Receivables

The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value.  This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts of

$84 million

and

$73 million

at

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively, to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances.  The Company estimates this allowance based on its history of write-offs, level of past-due accounts, and its relationships with, and the economic status of, its customers.  Portions of the allowance for uncollectible accounts are recorded in trade receivables, other current assets, and other assets.

Credit risk on receivables is minimized as a result of the large and diversified nature of the Company’s worldwide customer base.  The Company manages its exposure to counter-party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.  Collateral is generally not required for the Company’s receivables.

Accounts receivable due from unconsolidated affiliates as of

December 31, 2018

and


was

$161 million

and

$343 million

, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include inventories acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  In addition, the Company values certain inventories using the lower of cost, determined by either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods, or net realizable value.

The following table sets forth the Company’s inventories as of

December 31, 2018

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value.  Three levels are established within the fair value hierarchy that may be used to report fair value:  Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2:  Observable inputs, including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification.  Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.

Based on historical experience with the Company’s suppliers and customers, the Company’s own credit risk and knowledge of current market conditions, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.  However, in certain cases, if the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input, the Company records estimated fair value adjustments, and classifies the measurement in Level 3.

In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy.  The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy.  The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.

The Company’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.

Derivatives

The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet.  Unrealized gains are reported as other current assets and unrealized losses are reported as accrued expenses and other payables.  The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.  The majority of the Company’s derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments, and as such, changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately.  For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company designates the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.

Beginning in 2017, for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  Hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.

Prior to 2017, gain or loss on the derivative instrument that was in excess of the cumulative change in the cash flows of the hedged item, if any (i.e., the ineffective portion) were recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost.  Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company generally uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: buildings -


to


years; machinery and equipment -


to


years.  The Company capitalized interest on major construction projects in progress of

$21 million

,

$17 million

, and

$20 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law.  Applicable accounting standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.

The Company classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense and classifies tax-related penalties as selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of


to


years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  The Company’s accounting policy is to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on October 1 of each fiscal year or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  The Company recorded impairment charges for goodwill and intangibles totaling

$9 million

related to customer lists and

$11 million

related to computer software during the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively.  There were

no

impairment charges recorded for goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended

December 31, 2017

(see Note 9 for additional information).

Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  Assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the Company’s ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose, employ the assets in alternative uses, or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  Fair value is generally based on discounted cash flow analysis which relies on management’s estimate of market participant assumptions (a Level 3 measurement under applicable accounting standards).  During the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


, impairment charges were

$100 million

,

$101 million

, and

$17 million

, respectively.  Asset abandonment and impairment charges in 2018 included a

$49 million

discontinued software project (see Note 18 for additional information).

Payables to Brokerage Customers

Payables to brokerage customers represent the total of customer accounts at the Company’s futures commission merchant with credit or positive balances.  Customer accounts are used primarily in connection with commodity transactions and include gains and losses on open commodity trades as well as securities and other deposits made for margins or other purposes as required by the Company or the exchange-clearing organizations or counterparties.  Payables to brokerage customers have a corresponding balance in segregated cash and investments and customer omnibus receivable in other current assets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Revenues

The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, or container freight moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of ASC Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(Topic 606).  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20,

Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets

(Topic 610-20).

Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


were

$6.8 billion

,

$6.0 billion

, and

$4.2 billion

, respectively.

Stock Compensation

The Company recognizes expense for its stock compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted.  The Company’s stock compensation plans provide for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock options.  The fair values of stock options and performance stock units are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and a lattice valuation model, respectively.  These valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions.  Measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock compensation award.

Research and Development

Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.  Such costs incurred, net of expenditures subsequently reimbursed by government grants, were

$141 million

,

$129 million

, and

$123 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


, respectively.

Per Share Data

Basic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings attributable to controlling interests by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  In computing diluted earnings per share, average number of common shares outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise prices lower than the average market price of common shares using the treasury share method.

Business Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with ASC Topic 805,

Business Combinations,

as amended

.

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the consideration, if any, recorded as goodwill.  During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the purchase price allocations.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Subtopic 825-10,

Financial Instruments - Overall

, which is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.  The amended guidance requires an entity to measure equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee, at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  The amended guidance also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by using a qualitative assessment to identify impairment.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results.


Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new guidance of ASC Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

for all contracts that had not been completed as of the adoption date (the modified retrospective approach).  Topic 606 requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new guidance requires the Company to apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.  Many of the Company’s forward commodity sales contracts are considered physically settled derivatives under ASC Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

(Topic 815), and are therefore excluded from the scope of Topic 606.  Comparative balance sheet and statement of earnings information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the guidance of ASC 605,

Revenue Recognition

(Topic 605), that was in effect as of December 31, 2017 and in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.  The cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance as an adjustment to the opening reinvested earnings balance at January 1, 2018 was

less than

$1 million

.  For more information about the adoption of Topic 606, see Note 2.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC 230,

Statement of Cash Flows

(Topic 230), which provides guidance on the application of the predominance principle and the presentation and classification of specific cash flow issues including a requirement to classify consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for selling trade receivables as investing instead of operating activities.  The adoption of the amended guidance on the Company’s accounts receivable securitization programs resulted in expanded disclosures and a reclassification of cash inflows from operating activities to investing activities (see Note 1 for reclassification amounts).

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 715,

Compensation - Retirement Benefits

, which requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.  The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented.  The adoption of this amended guidance required expanded disclosures and the reclassification of the non-service components of net benefit cost from cost of products sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses to other (income) expense - net in the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings but did not impact financial results (see Note 1 for reclassification amounts).

Pending Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company will be required to adopt the new guidance of ASC Topic 842,

Leases

(Topic 842), which will supersede ASC Topic 840,

Leases

.  Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases.  The Company will adopt Topic 842 using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  The adoption of this new guidance will require expanded disclosures in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  The Company has established a cross-functional implementation team consisting of representatives from accounting, legal, procurement, and operations.  The Company utilized surveys to centrally gather more information about its existing leases and lease processes and to gather lease contracts.  To ensure completeness of the population of lease contracts, the results of the survey were cross-referenced against other available lease information (i.e., year-end disclosures and authorization for expenditure listings).  The Company has implemented a lease accounting system which will assist in delivering the required accounting changes and disclosures.  The adoption of the new standard will result in a significant increase to right of use assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, primarily as a result of operating leases currently not recognized on the balance sheet. The Company estimates that it will record right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of approximately

$0.7 billion

to

$0.8 billion

at the January 1, 2019 transition date.


Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 220,

Income Statement -Reporting Comprehensive Income

(Topic 220), which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), eliminating the stranded tax effects resulting from the Act and improving the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users.  In addition, the Company will be required to disclose (1) a description of its accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income; (2) whether it elects to reclassify the stranded income tax effects from the Act; and (3) information about other income tax effects related to the application of the Act that are reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings, if any.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim period for which financial statements have not been issued.  The Company has elected not to reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from the Act.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 326,

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

, which is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.  The amended guidance requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 820,

Fair Value Measurement

, which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements.  Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this amended guidance will not impact the Company’s financial results.

Effective December 31, 2020, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Subtopic 715-20,

Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General

, which modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans.  Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this amended guidance will not impact the Company’s financial results.

Note 2.     Revenues

Revenue Recognition

The Company principally generates revenue from merchandising and transporting agricultural commodities and manufactured products used as ingredients in food and beverages, feed, energy, and industrial products.  Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.  The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, or container freight moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of Topic 606.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs related to contracts with customers for sale of goods are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and are included in cost of products sold.  Accordingly, amounts billed to customers for such costs are included as a component of revenues.

Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities

The Company does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers, in the measurement of transactions prices or as a component of revenues and cost of products sold.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 2.     Revenues (Continued)

Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations

The Company generally recognizes revenue at a point in time with the exception of revenue from transportation services which is recognized over time.  The majority of the Company’s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less.  The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 10-50-14 of Topic 606 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.

Contract Liabilities

Contract liabilities relate to advance payments from customers for goods and services that the Company has yet to provide.  Contract liabilities of

$501 million

and

$519 million

as of

December 31, 2018

and January 1, 2018, respectively, were recorded in accrued expenses and other payables in the consolidated balance sheet.  Contract liabilities recognized as revenues for the year ended

Note 2.     Revenues (Continued)

Origination

The Origination segment generates revenue from the sale of commodities and from service fees for the transportation of goods.  Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.  Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product or providing service to a customer.  For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, or container freight moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of  Topic 606.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20.

Oilseeds

The Oilseeds segment generates revenue primarily from the sale of products manufactured in its global processing facilities.  The segment also generates revenue from the sale of raw commodities in its South American grain origination business and from the sale of peanuts, tree nuts, and peanut-derived ingredients.  Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product.  The amount of revenue recognized follows the contractually specified price which may include freight or other contractually specified cost components.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20.

Carbohydrate Solutions

The Carbohydrate Solutions segment generates revenue from the sale of products manufactured at the Company’s global corn and milling facilities around the world.  Revenue is recognized when control over products is transferred to the customer.  Products are shipped to the customers from the Company’s various facilities and from its network of storage terminals.  The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration specified in the contract which could include freight and other costs depending on the specific shipping terms of each contract.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20.

Nutrition

The Nutrition segment sells specialty products including natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, animal nutrition products, and other specialty food and feed ingredients.  Revenue is recognized when control over products is transferred to the customer.  The amount of revenue recognized follows the contracted price or the mutually agreed price of the product.  Freight and shipping are recognized as a component of revenue at the same time control transfers to the customer.

Other

Other includes the Company’s futures commission business whose primary sources of revenue are commissions and brokerage income generated from executing orders and clearing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on behalf of its customers.  Commissions and brokerage revenue are recognized on the date the transaction is executed.  Other also includes the Company’s captive insurance business which generates third-party revenue through its proportionate share of premiums from third-party reinsurance pools.  Reinsurance premiums are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period underlying the policy.

Note 4.      Fair Value Measurements

The following tables set forth, by level, the Company’s assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2018

and


.


Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4.      Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

Estimated fair values for inventories carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets, broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter (OTC) markets.  Market valuations for the Company’s inventories are adjusted for location and quality because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade.  When unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the inventory is classified in Level 3.  Changes in the fair value of inventories are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.

Derivative contracts include exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts, forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, and OTC instruments related primarily to agricultural commodities, energy, interest rates, and foreign currencies.  Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1.  The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables.  Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets.  These differences are generally determined using inputs from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets.  When observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, it is classified in Level 2.  When unobservable inputs have a significant impact (more than 10%) on the measurement of fair value, the contract is classified in Level 3.  Except for certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of commodity-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, and other (income) expense - net, depending upon the purpose of the contract.  The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as effective cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) until the hedged items are recorded in earnings or it is probable the hedged transaction will no longer occur.


Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4.      Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

The Company’s cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1.

The Company’s marketable securities are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and corporate debt securities.  U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.  Corporate debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and substantially all are classified in Level 2.  Unrealized changes in the fair value of available-for-sale marketable debt securities are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of AOCI unless a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary at which point the decline is recorded in earnings.

The Company’s segregated investments are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities.  U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.

The Company has deferred consideration under its accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) which represents notes receivable from the purchasers under the Programs (see Note 19).  This amount is reflected in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 6).  The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received.  The fair value is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement) consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate.  Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the Programs which have historically been insignificant.

The following tables present a rollforward of the activity of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended

For all periods presented, the Company had no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.   Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts rising above the 10% threshold.   Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10% threshold and thus permitting reclassification to Level 2.

In some cases, the price components that result in differences between exchange-traded prices and local prices for inventories and commodity purchase and sale contracts are observable based upon available quotations for these pricing components, and in some cases, the differences are unobservable.  These price components primarily include transportation costs and other adjustments required due to location, quality, or other contract terms.  In the table below, these other adjustments are referred to as basis.  The changes in unobservable price components are determined by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market.  Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these unobservable price components.

The following table sets forth the weighted average percentage of the unobservable price components included in the Company’s Level 3 valuations as of

December 31, 2018

and


.  The Company’s Level 3 measurements may include basis only, transportation cost only, or both price components.  As an example, for Level 3 inventories with basis, the unobservable component as of

December 31, 2018

is a weighted average

18.5%

of the total price for assets and

125.0%

of the total price for liabilities.


Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4.      Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

In certain of the Company’s principal markets, the Company relies on price quotes from third parties to value its inventories and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts.  These price quotes are generally not further adjusted by the Company in determining the applicable market price.  In some cases, availability of third-party quotes is limited to only one or two independent sources.  In these situations, absent other corroborating evidence, the Company considers these price quotes as 100% unobservable and, therefore, the fair value of these items is reported in Level 3.

Note 5.     Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

The majority of the Company’s derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments.  The Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts to manage its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in agricultural commodities and foreign currencies.  The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the value of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets.  Derivatives, including exchange traded contracts and physical purchase or sale contracts, and inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  Inventory is not a derivative and therefore fair values of and changes in fair values of inventories are not included in the tables below.

The following table sets forth the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments as of

December 31, 2018

Changes in the market value of inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, exchange-traded futures, and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately as a component of cost of products sold.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value Hedging Strategies

As of

December 31, 2018

and


, the Company had certain derivatives designated as cash flow and fair value hedges.

The Company uses interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to protect the fair value of

$496 million

in fixed-rate debt due to changes in interest rates.  The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying fixed-rate debt are recorded in other (income) expense - net.  The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the underlying debt.  At

December 31, 2018

, the Company had

$4 million

in other current liabilities representing the fair value of the interest rate swaps and a corresponding decrease in the underlying debt for the same amount with no net impact to earnings.


Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 5.     Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued)

For each of the commodity hedge programs described below, the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.  Assuming normal market conditions, the changes in the market value of such derivative contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Once the hedged item is recognized in earnings, the gains/losses arising from the hedge are reclassified from AOCI to either revenues or cost of products sold, as applicable.  As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had

$31 million

of after-tax gains in AOCI related to gains and losses from commodity cash flow hedge transactions.  The Company expects to recognize

$31 million

of these after-tax gains in its consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months.

The Company uses futures or options contracts to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of corn to be purchased and processed in a future month.  The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s forecasted purchases of corn.  The Company’s corn processing plants currently grind approximately

72 million

bushels of corn per month.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between

23%

and

95%

of its monthly anticipated grind.  At

December 31, 2018

, the Company had designated hedges representing between

7%

to

60%

of its anticipated monthly grind of corn for the next 12 months.

The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to hedge the sales price of certain ethanol sales contracts.  The Company has established hedging programs for ethanol sales contracts that are indexed to unleaded gasoline prices and to various exchange-traded ethanol contracts.  The objective of these hedging programs is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s sales of ethanol.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between

2 million

and

135 million

gallons of ethanol sales per month under these programs.  At

December 31, 2018

, the Company had designated hedges representing between


to

52 million

gallons of ethanol sales per month over the next 12 months.

During the first quarter of 2018, the Company started using futures and options contracts to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of soybeans to be purchased and processed in a future month for certain of its U.S. soybean crush facilities.  The Company also uses futures or options contracts to hedge the sales prices of anticipated soybean meal and soybean oil sales proportionate to the soybean crushing process at these facilities.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between

0%

and

100%

of the anticipated monthly soybean crush for soybean purchases and soybean meal and oil sales at the designated facilities.  The Company has designated hedges representing between

0%

and

100%

of the anticipated monthly soybean crush for soybean purchases and soybean meal and oil sales at the designated facilities over the next 12 months.

one

to

five

years, and expire

ten

years after the date of grant.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model.  The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock.  The volatility of the Company’s stock was calculated based upon the monthly closing price of the Company’s stock for the period immediately prior to the date of grant corresponding to the average expected life of the grant.  The average expected life represents the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding.  The risk-free rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of option grants.  The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model are as follows.

The Company’s 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units (Restricted Stock Awards) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.  In addition, the Company’s 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan also provides for the granting of performance stock units (PSUs) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.  Restricted Stock Awards are made in common stock or stock units with equivalent rights and vest at the end of a

three

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 13.     Income Taxes (Continued)

Reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings is as follows:

The foreign rate differential is primarily due to lower tax rates from the Company's operations in Switzerland, Asia, and the Caribbean.  The Company’s foreign earnings, which were taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate and were generated from these jurisdictions, were

56%

,

59%

, and

47%

of its foreign earnings before taxes in fiscal years


,


, and


, respectively.

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and the Company’s share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method aggregated to approximately

$10.5 billion

at

December 31, 2018

.  Because the Company’s undistributed foreign earnings and outside basis differences inherent in foreign entities continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, no income taxes, other than the transition tax and the minimum tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI), have been provided.  It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis differences in these entities.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017.  The income tax effects of changes in tax laws are recognized in the period when enacted.   The Act provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications with varying effective dates, which include reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from

35%

to

21%

, creating a territorial tax system (with a one-time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings), broadening the tax base, and allowing for immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property. As a result, the Company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax, and recognized a net provisional benefit of

$379 million

, which is included as a component of income tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2017.  The net provisional benefit consisted of a net tax benefit of

$528 million

related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balance and a beneficial impact of

$220 million

on reserves previously established under ASC Subtopic 740-30,

Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas,

partially offset by the

$369 million

provisional impact of the transition tax.  The Company performed a quarterly review of the provisional tax liability recorded in 2017 as new guidance on the Act was issued in 2018.  The Company finalized its calculation of the transition tax and recorded a tax benefit of

$29 million

in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of pending Treasury Regulations on the Company’s transition tax calculation, and will record any adjustment in 2019.  The Company has elected to pay the one-time transition tax over eight years.


Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 13.     Income Taxes (Continued)

The Act also contains new provisions related to GILTI and Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) which are effective for fiscal year 2018.  In 2018, the Company incurred additional U.S. taxable income of

$101 million

related to GILTI, and deducted

$101 million

related to FDII.  The Company made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI as a period cost.  During 2018, U.S. tax authorities issued proposed Treasury Regulations addressing some of the tax reform items that were effective in 2018.  Once final Treasury Regulations are issued, the Company will record the impact of any changes in 2019.  It is also reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing their current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the Act.  The additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, may affect significant deductions and income inclusions and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net income or cash flow.

Note 13.     Income Taxes (Continued)

The Company is subject to income taxation and routine examinations in many jurisdictions around the world and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature, and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various jurisdictions.  In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company recognizes a liability, when necessary, for estimated potential tax owed by the Company in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete.  Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions and the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these ongoing or future examinations.  However, the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months.  Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions, the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Company’s effective income tax rate in any given period.  If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized by the Company at one time, there would be a reduction of

$107 million

on the tax expense for that period.

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ADM do Brasil Ltda. (ADM do Brasil), has received

three

separate tax assessments from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service

(BFRS)

challenging the tax deductibility of commodity hedging losses and related expenses for the tax years 2004, 2006 and 2007.  These assessments totaled approximately

$109 million

in tax and

$308 million

in interest and penalties as of

December 31, 2018

(adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates).  The statute of limitations for tax years 2005 and 2008 to 2011 has expired.  The Company does not expect to receive any additional tax assessments with respect to this issue.

ADM do Brasil enters into commodity hedging transactions that can result in gains, which are included in ADM do Brasil’s calculation of taxable income in Brazil, and losses, which ADM do Brasil deducts from its taxable income in Brazil.  The Company has evaluated its tax position regarding these hedging transactions and concluded, based upon advice from Brazilian legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize both gains and losses resulting from hedging transactions when determining its Brazilian income tax expense.  Therefore, the Company has continued to recognize the tax benefit from hedging losses in its financial statements and has not recorded any tax liability for the amounts assessed by the BFRS.

ADM do Brasil filed an administrative appeal for each of the assessments.  The appeal panel found in favor of the BFRS on these assessments and ADM do Brasil filed a second level administrative appeal.  The second administrative appeal panel continues to conduct customary procedural activities, including ongoing dialogue with the BFRS auditor.  If ADM do Brasil continues to be unsuccessful in the administrative appellate process, the Company intends to file appeals in the Brazilian federal courts.  While the Company believes its consolidated financial statements properly reflect the tax deductibility of these hedging losses, the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in the future recognition of additional payments of, and expense for, income tax and the associated interest and penalties.  The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessment.

In 2012, the Company’s subsidiaries in Argentina, ADM Argentina and Alfred Toepfer Argentina, received tax assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for the tax years 2004 through 2010.  As of

December 31, 2018

, these assessments totaled

$17 million

in tax and

$58 million

in interest and penalties (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates).  The Argentine tax authorities conducted a review of income and other taxes paid by large exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities resulting in allegations of income tax evasion.  The Company strongly believes that it has complied with all Argentine tax laws.  To date, the Company has not received assessments for tax years subsequent to 2010.  However, it cannot rule out receiving additional assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for these years, and estimates that these potential assessments could be approximately

$52 million

in tax and

$58 million

in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates).  The Company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transactions underlying these assessments, and has concluded, based on Argentine tax law, that its tax position would be sustained, and accordingly, has not recorded a tax liability for these assessments.  The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for years subsequent to 2010.


Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 13.     Income Taxes (Continued)

In accordance with the accounting requirements for uncertain tax positions, the Company has not recorded an uncertain tax liability for these assessments because it has concluded that it is more likely than not to prevail on the Brazil and Argentina matters based upon their technical merits and because the taxing jurisdictions’ processes do not provide a mechanism for settling at less than the full amount of the assessment.  The Company’s consideration of these tax assessments requires judgments about the application of income tax regulations to specific facts and circumstances.  The final outcome of these matters cannot reliably be predicted, may take many years to resolve, and could result in financial impacts of up to the entire amount of these assessments.

In 2014, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, ADM Europe B.V., received a tax assessment from the Netherlands tax authority challenging the transfer pricing aspects of a 2009 business reorganization which involved two of its subsidiary companies in the Netherlands.  As of

December 31, 2018

, this assessment was

$93 million

in tax and

$31 million

in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates).  The Company has appealed the assessment and carefully evaluated the underlying transactions and has concluded that the amount of the gain recognized on the reorganization for tax purposes was appropriate.  While the Company plans to vigorously defend its position against the assessment, it has accrued an amount it believes would be the likely outcome of the litigation.  The Company’s defense of the judicial appeal may take an extended period of time and could result in additional financial impacts of up to the entire amount of this assessment.

Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans

The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain foreign subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.  The Company provides certain eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with subsidized postretirement health care coverage or Health Care Reimbursement Accounts.

In October 2018, the Company amended the ADM Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) and entered into a binding agreement to purchase a group annuity contract from The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“Prudential”), irrevocably transferring the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for approximately

3,800

retirees from the Plan to Prudential.  The purchase of the group annuity contract, which was funded directed by the Plan’s assets, was completed on November 2, 2018 and reduced the Company's pension obligations by approximately

$528 million

.  As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of approximately

$117 million

in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)

In July 2017, the Company announced that all participants in the Company’s U.S. salaried pension plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) will begin accruing benefits under the cash balance formula effective January 1, 2022.  Benefits for participants who were accruing under the final average pay formula will be frozen as of December 31, 2021, including pay and service through that date.  This change, along with other changes in participation associated with divestitures and restructuring, triggered a remeasurement of the salaried pension plan and the SERP resulting in decreases in the fiscal 2017 pension expense, accumulated other comprehensive loss, and underfunded status by

$18 million

,

$164 million

, and

$182 million

, respectively.

In 2017, the Company also changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs for its U.S., Canadian, and U.K. plans.  The new method uses the spot rate yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs. Previously, those costs were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate applied to all future cash outflows. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company’s benefit obligations and was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 250,

Accounting Estimates and Error Corrections

, thereby impacting the current and future periods.  The impact of this change on after-tax earnings and diluted earnings per share for the year ended

December 31, 2017

was immaterial.

In December 2016, the Company announced a change to the U.S. retiree medical program which affected employees with less than


years of service at January 1, 2017.  The change resulted in a curtailment gain of

$38 million

for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The Company maintains 401(k) plans covering substantially all U.S. employees.  The Company contributes cash to the plans to match qualifying employee contributions, and also provides a non-matching employer contribution of

1%

of pay to eligible participants.  Under an employee stock ownership component of the 401(k) plans, employees may choose to invest in the Company's stock as part of their own investment elections.  The employer contributions are expensed when paid.  Assets of the Company’s       401(k) plans consist primarily of listed common stocks and pooled funds.  The Company’s 401(k) plans held

9 million

shares of Company common stock at

December 31, 2018

Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)

Plan Assets

The Company’s employee benefit plan assets are principally comprised of the following types of investments:

Common stock:

Equity securities are valued based on quoted exchange prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Mutual funds:

Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Common collective trust (CCT) funds:

The fair values of the CCTs are valued using net asset value (NAV).  The investments in CCTs are comprised of international equity and short-term investments.  The investments are valued at NAV provided by administrators of the funds.

Corporate debt instruments:

Corporate debt instruments are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

U.S.  Treasury instruments:

U.S. Treasury instruments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

U.S. government agency, state, and local government bonds:

U.S. government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants’ methods, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The Company’s U.S. pension plans contain approximately

73%

of the Company’s global pension plan assets.  The actual asset allocation for the Company’s U.S. pension plans as of the measurement date consists of

55%

equity securities and

45%

debt .  The target asset allocation for the Company’s U.S. pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation.  The Company’s U.S. pensions plans’ assets and asset allocation reflect the impact of the

$528 million

purchase of the group annuity contract, which was funded directed by the Plan’s assets, transferring the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for approximately

3,800

retirees from the Plan to Prudential on November 2, 2018.  The actual asset allocation for the Company’s foreign pension plans as of the measurement date consists of

32%

equity securities,

26%

debt securities, and

42%

in other investments.  The target asset allocation for the Company’s foreign pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation.

(2)

The Company’s pension plans did not directly hold any shares of Company common stock as of the

December 31, 2018

and


measurement dates.

Investment objectives for the Company’s plan assets are to:

•

Optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk.

•

Maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers.

•

Maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.

Asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans.  Selection of the targeted asset allocation for plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes.  The U.S. pension plans target asset allocation is also based on an asset and liability study that is updated periodically.

Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.  These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements, and credit quality standards, where applicable.  In some countries, derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of underlying investments.

The Company uses external consultants to assist in monitoring the investment strategy and asset mix for the Company’s plan assets.  To develop the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets, the Company generally uses long-term historical return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability studies.  Adjustments are made to the expected long-term rate of return assumption when deemed necessary based upon revised expectations of future investment performance of the overall investment markets.

Contributions and Expected Future Benefit Payments

Based on actuarial calculations, the Company expects to contribute

$27 million

to the pension plans and

$13 million

to the postretirement benefit plan during 2019.  The Company may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during this period.

Note 17.     Segment and Geographic Information

The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities, products, and ingredients.  The Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into

four

reportable business segments:  Origination, Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard

,

and are classified as Other.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect changes in its operating structure.  The Company new segments are  Origination (formerly Agricultural Services), Oilseeds (formerly Oilseeds Processing), Carbohydrate Solutions (formerly Corn Processing), and Nutrition (formerly Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients).  The European origination business previously reported in Oilseeds is now managed by leaders in Origination to better coordinate continental trading activities.  Carbohydrate Solutions now includes the results of ADM Milling, which were previously reported in Origination.  In addition, the Company also moved the segment reporting of its renewable chemicals business from Carbohydrate Solutions to Oilseeds effective July 1, 2018.  Nutrition now includes the results of Animal Nutrition and certain product lines previously reported in Carbohydrate Solutions as well as certain product lines previously reported in Oilseeds.

Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

The Origination segment utilizes its extensive global grain elevator and transportation networks and port operations to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.

Note 19.     Sale of Accounts Receivable

Since March 2012, the Company has had an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Program”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the “Purchasers”).  Under the Program, certain U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Receivables, LLC (“ADM Receivables”).  ADM Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.  In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Receivables receives a cash payment of up to

$1.2 billion

and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Program terminates on June 20, 2019, unless extended.


Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 19.     Sale of Accounts Receivable (Continued)

In March 2014, the Company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program (the “Second Program”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the “Second Purchasers”).  Under the Second Program, certain non-U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Ireland Receivables Company (“ADM Ireland Receivables”).  ADM Ireland Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Second Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.    In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to

$0.6 billion

(

€0.5 billion

) and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Second Program terminates on March 15, 2019, unless extended.

Under the Program and Second Program (collectively, the “Programs”), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the Purchasers and Second Purchasers (collectively, the "Purchasers") and other consideration to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables.

The Company accounts for these transfers as sales.  The Company has no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and its right to the deferred consideration.  At

December 31, 2018

and


, the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions, and its cost of servicing the receivables sold.

As of

December 31, 2018

and


, the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the Purchasers under the Programs and derecognized from the Company’s consolidated balance sheet was

$1.9 billion

and

$1.7 billion

, respectively.  In exchange for the transfer as of

December 31, 2018

and


, the Company received cash of

$1.5 billion

and

$1.4 billion

and recorded a receivable for deferred consideration included in other current assets of

$379 million

and

$307 million

, respectively.  Cash collections from customers on receivables sold were

$34.8 billion

,

$33.5 billion

, and

$34.3 billion

for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


, respectively.  Of this amount,

$14.8 billion

,

$12.5 billion

, and

$11.9 billion

were cash collections on the deferred consideration reflected as cash inflows from investing activities for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


, respectively.  Deferred consideration is paid to the Company in cash on behalf of the Purchasers as receivables are collected; however, as this is a revolving facility, cash collected from the Company’s customers is reinvested by the Purchasers daily in new receivable purchases under the Programs.

The Company’s risk of loss following the transfer of accounts receivable under the Programs is limited to the deferred consideration outstanding.  The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received and is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement under the applicable accounting standards) consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate.  Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the Programs which have historically been insignificant.

Transfers of receivables under the Programs during the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


, and


resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of

$18 million

,

$10 million

, and

$6 million

, respectively, which is classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.

The Company reflects all cash flows related to the Programs as operating activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the short-term nature of the Company’s trade receivables.

Note 20.     Legal Proceedings

The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 for information on income tax matters), and class actions. The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of our business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution with the applicable government authorities.  The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice.

The Company has been a party to numerous lawsuits pending in various U.S. state and federal courts arising out of Syngenta Corporation’s (Syngenta) marketing and distribution of genetically modified corn products, Agrisure Viptera and Agrisure Duracade, in the U.S.  First, the Company brought a state court action in Louisiana against Syngenta in 2014, alleging Syngenta was negligent in commercializing its products before the products were approved in China.  In December 2017, the Company and Syngenta reached a confidential settlement of this action.  Second, Syngenta brought third-party claims against the Company in 2015 in a federal multidistrict litigation (MDL) in Kansas City, Kansas, a state court MDL in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and other courts, seeking contribution in the event Syngenta is held liable in class actions by farmers and other parties.  In the December 2017 settlement, Syngenta agreed to dismiss all of these third-party claims against the Company.  Third, farmers and other parties have sued the Company and other grain companies in numerous individual and purported class action suits in Illinois state and federal courts beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, alleging the Company and other grain companies were negligent in failing to screen for genetically modified corn.  On January 4, 2017, a federal court in the Southern District of Illinois dismissed, subject to appeal, all of the pending federal complaints against the Company, and thus the Company remains a defendant only in certain Illinois state court actions by farmers and other parties, which actions the Company has moved to dismiss as well.  The Company denies liability in all of the actions in which it has been named as a third-party defendant or defendant and is vigorously defending itself in these cases.  All of these actions are in pretrial proceedings.  At this time, the Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter with any reasonable degree of certainty, but believes the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of

December 31, 2018

, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)).  Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing business transformation program, which is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes.  The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.  The Company has currently implemented changes to certain processes in corporate finance and in over


locations including two processing businesses, and will continue to implement process and system changes over the next several years.  The Company has appropriately considered these changes in its design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and concluded, as part of the evaluation described in the above paragraph, that the implementation of the new ERP in these circumstances has not materially affected its internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  The Company's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

December 31, 2018

based on the framework set forth in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).  Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2018
