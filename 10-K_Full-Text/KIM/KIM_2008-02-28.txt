which are based on certain assumptions and describe the Company’s future plans,
strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words
"believe," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "project" or similar
expressions. You should not rely on forward-looking statements since they
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in
some cases, beyond the Company’s control and which could materially affect
actual results, performances or achievements.  Factors which may cause
actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are
not limited to, (i) general economic and local real estate conditions, (ii) the
inability of major tenants to continue paying their rent obligations due to
bankruptcy, insolvency or general downturn in their business, (iii) financing
risks, such as the inability to obtain equity, debt or other sources of
financing on favorable terms, (iv) changes in governmental laws and regulations,
(v) the level and volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates, (vi) the availability of suitable acquisition opportunities and (vii)
increases in operating costs. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the
Company’s expectations will be realized.

SHARE SPLIT

As of August 23, 2005, the Company effected a two-for-one
split (the "Stock Split") of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock
dividend paid to stockholders of record on August 8, 2005.  All common

Item 1.  Business

General

Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, is one
of the nation's largest owners and operators of neighborhood and community
shopping centers.  The terms "Kimco", the "Company", "we", "our" and "us"
each refer to Kimco Realty Corporation and our subsidiaries unless the context
indicates otherwise.  The Company is a self-administered real estate
investment trust ("REIT") and its management has owned and operated neighborhood
and community shopping centers for over 45 years.  The Company has not
engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisors in connection with the
operation of its properties.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
interests in 1,973 properties, totaling approximately 183 million square feet of
gross leasable area ("GLA") located in 45 states, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico
and Chile. The Company’s ownership interests in real estate consist of its
consolidated portfolio and in portfolios where the Company owns an economic
interest, such as properties in the Company’s investment management programs,
where the Company partners with institutional investors and also retains
management (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in this annual report on Form 10-K).  The Company believes its
portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping center properties is the
largest (measured by GLA) currently held by any publicly traded REIT.

The Company's executive offices are located at 3333 New
Hyde Park Road, New Hyde Park, New York 11042-0020 and its telephone number is
(516) 869-9000.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the

(the "SEC").

History

The Company began operations through its predecessor, The
Kimco Corporation, which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several
shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders.  In 1973,
these principals formed the Company as a Delaware corporation, and in 1985, the
operations of The Kimco Corporation were merged into the Company.  The
Company completed its initial public stock offering (the "IPO") in November
1991, and commencing with its taxable year which began January 1, 1992, elected
to qualify as a REIT in accordance with Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  In 1994, the Company
reorganized as a Maryland corporation.

The Company's growth through its first 15 years resulted
primarily from the ground-up development and construction of its shopping
centers.  By 1981, the Company had assembled a portfolio of 77 properties
that provided an established source of income and positioned the Company for an
expansion of its asset base.  At that time, the Company revised its growth
strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and creating
value through the redevelopment and re-tenanting of those properties.  As a
result of this strategy, a majority of the operating shopping centers added to
the Company’s portfolio since 1981 have been through the acquisition of existing
shopping centers.

During 1998, the Company, through a merger transaction,
completed the acquisition of The Price REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, (the
"Price REIT").  Prior to the merger, Price REIT was a self-administered and
self-managed equity REIT that was primarily focused on the acquisition,
development, management and redevelopment of large retail community shopping
center properties concentrated in the western part of the United States.
 In connection with the merger, the Company acquired interests in 43
properties, located in 17 states.  With the completion of the Price REIT
merger, the Company expanded its presence in certain western states including
Arizona, California and Washington.  In addition, Price REIT had strong
ground-up development capabilities.  These development capabilities,
coupled with the Company’s own construction management expertise, provide the
Company the ability to pursue ground-up development opportunities on a selective
basis.

Also during 1998, the Company formed Kimco Income REIT
("KIR"), an entity in which the Company held a 99.99% limited partnership
interest.  KIR was established for the purpose of investing in high-quality
properties financed primarily with individual non-recourse mortgages.  The
Company believed that these properties were appropriate for financing with
greater leverage than the Company traditionally used.  At the time of
formation, the Company contributed 19 properties to KIR, each encumbered by an
individual non-recourse mortgage.  During 1999, KIR sold a significant
interest in the partnership to institutional investors, thus establishing the
Company’s investment management program.  The Company holds a 45.0%
non-controlling limited partnership interest in KIR and accounts for its
investment in KIR under the equity method of accounting.  (See Note 7 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on
Form 10-K.)

The Company has expanded its investment management
program through the establishment of other various institutional joint venture
programs in which the Company has non-controlling interests ranging generally
from 5% to 45%.  The Company’s largest joint venture, Kimco Prudential
Joint Venture ("KimPru"), was formed in 2006, in connection with the Pan Pacific
Retail Properties Inc. ("Pan Pacific") merger transaction, with Prudential Real
Estate Investors ("PREI"), which holds approximately $3.6 billion in assets.
 The Company earns management fees, acquisition fees, disposition fees and
promoted interests based on value creation.  As of December 31, 2007, the
Company’s assets under management were valued at approximately $14.0 billion,
comprising 441 properties.  (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)

In connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999
(the "RMA") which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to
participate in activities from which it was previously precluded in order to
maintain its qualification as a REIT, so long as these activities are conducted
in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code,
subject to certain limitations.  As such, the Company, through its taxable
REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate related
opportunities, including (i) merchant building through its


wholly-owned taxable REIT
subsidiaries, including Kimco Developers, Inc. ("KDI"), which are primarily
engaged in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping
centers and subsequent sale thereof upon completion (see Recent Developments -
Ground-Up Development), (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition
services, which primarily focus on leasing and disposition strategies for real
estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers and (iii)
acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax-deferred exchange
transactions.  The Company will consider other investments through taxable
REIT subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise.

The Company has continued its geographic expansion with
investments in Canada, Mexico,  Puerto Rico and Chile. During October 2001,
the Company formed the RioCan Venture ("RioCan Venture") with RioCan Real Estate
Investment Trust ("RioCan", Canada’s largest publicly traded REIT measured by
GLA) in which the Company has a 50% non-controlling interest, to acquire retail
properties and development projects in Canada.  The Company accounts for
this investment under the equity method of accounting.  The Company has
expanded its presence in Canada with the establishment of other joint venture
arrangements.  During 2002, the Company, along with various strategic
co-investment partners, began acquiring operating and development properties
located in Mexico.  During 2006, the Company acquired interests in shopping
center properties located in Puerto Rico through joint ventures in which the
Company holds controlling ownership interests.  During 2007, the Company
acquired an interest in four shopping center properties located in Chile through
a joint venture in which the Company holds a non-controlling ownership interest.
(See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
this annual report on Form 10-K.)

In addition, the Company continues to capitalize on its
established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in
which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management,
leasing and operational support for those properties.  The Company also
provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides
real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed
retailers.  The Company also makes selective investments in secondary
market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management’s
judgment, priced below the value of the underlying assets.

Investment and Operating Strategy

The Company's investment objective has been to increase
cash flow, current income and, consequently, the value of its existing portfolio
of properties and to seek continued growth through (i) the strategic
re-tenanting, renovation and expansion of its existing centers and (ii) the
selective acquisition of established income-producing real estate properties and
properties requiring significant re-tenanting and redevelopment, primarily in
neighborhood and community shopping centers in geographic regions in which the
Company presently operates.  The Company has and will continue to consider
investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does
not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise.

The Company's neighborhood and community shopping center
properties are designed to attract local area customers and typically are
anchored by a discount department store, a supermarket or a drugstore tenant
offering day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items.  The
Company may either purchase or lease income-producing properties in the future
and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through
partnerships, joint ventures or similar types of co-ownership.  Equity
investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and/or other
indebtedness.  Financing or other indebtedness may be incurred
simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments.  Any
such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the Company’s equity
interest in such property. The Company may make loans to joint ventures in which
it may or may not participate.

In addition to property or equity ownership, the Company
provides property management services for fees relating to the management,
leasing, operation, supervision and maintenance of real estate properties.

While the Company has historically held its properties
for long-term investment and accordingly has placed strong emphasis on its
ongoing program of regular maintenance, periodic renovation and capital
improvement, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold, in
whole or in part, as circumstances warrant, subject to REIT qualification
rules.

The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing
risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its
properties and a large tenant base.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company's
single largest


neighborhood and community
shopping center accounted for only 1.7% of the Company's annualized base rental
revenues and only 0.8% of the Company’s total shopping center GLA.  At
December 31, 2007, the Company’s five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX
Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohl’s and Wal-Mart, which represent approximately
3.2%, 2.8%, 2.3%, 2.0% and 1.9%, respectively, of the Company’s annualized base
rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from
properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest.

In connection with the RMA, which became effective
January 1, 2001, the Company has expanded its investment and operating strategy
to include new real estate-related opportunities which the Company was precluded
from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT.  As such,
the Company has established a merchant building business through its wholly
owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which make selective acquisitions of land
parcels for the ground-up development primarily of neighborhood and community
shopping centers and subsequent sale thereof upon completion.
 Additionally, the Company has developed a business which specializes in
providing capital, real estate advisory services and disposition services of
real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and/or bankrupt retailers.
 These services may include assistance with inventory and fixture
liquidation in connection with going-out-of-business sales.  The Company
may participate with other entities in providing these advisory services through
partnerships, joint ventures or other co-ownership arrangements. The Company, as
a regular part of its investment strategy, will continue to actively seek
investments for its taxable REIT subsidiaries.

The Company emphasizes equity real estate investments
including preferred equity investments, but may, at its discretion, invest in
mortgages, other real estate interests and other investments. The mortgages in
which the Company may invest may be either first mortgages, junior mortgages or
other mortgage-related securities.  The Company provides mortgage financing
to retailers with significant real estate assets, in the form of leasehold
interests or fee-owned properties, where the Company believes the underlying
value of the real estate collateral is in excess of its loan balance.  In
addition, the Company will acquire debt instruments at a discount in the
secondary market where the Company believes the asset value of the enterprise is greater than the current value.

The Company may legally invest in the securities of other
issuers, for the purpose, among others, of exercising control over such
entities, subject to the gross income and asset tests necessary for REIT
qualification.  The Company may, on a selective basis, acquire all or
substantially all securities or assets of other REITs or similar entities where
such investments would be consistent with the Company’s investment policies.
 In any event, the Company does not intend that its investments in
securities will require it to register as an "investment company" under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.

The Company has authority to offer shares of capital
stock or other senior securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or
otherwise reacquire its common stock or any other securities and may engage in
such activities in the future.  At all times, the Company intends to make
investments in such a manner as to be consistent with the requirements of the
Code to qualify as a REIT unless, because of circumstances or changes in the
Code (or in Treasury Regulations), the Board of Directors determines that it is
no longer in the best interests of the Company to qualify as a REIT.

Capital Strategy and Resources

The Company intends to operate with and maintain a
conservative capital structure with a level of debt to total market
capitalization of approximately 50% or less.  As of December 31, 2007, the
Company’s level of debt to total market capitalization was 30%.  In
addition, the Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed
charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its
investment-grade debt ratings.  It is management's intention that the
Company continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and
develop its business.  Accordingly, the Company may, from time-to-time,
seek to obtain funds through additional common and preferred equity offerings,
unsecured debt financings and/or mortgage/construction loan financings and other
capital alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a
conservative debt structure.

Since the completion of the Company's IPO in 1991, the
Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source
of capital for its expansion needs.  Since the IPO, the Company has
completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising
in the aggregate over $5.7 billion.  Proceeds from public capital
market


activities have been used for
repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community
shopping centers, funding ground-up development projects, expanding and
improving properties in the portfolio and other investments, among other things.
 The Company also has revolving credit facilities totaling approximately
$1.8 billion available for general corporate purposes.  At December 31,
2007 the Company had approximately $282.2 million outstanding on the facilities.
 In March 2006, the Company was added to the S & P 500 Index, an index
containing the stock of 500 Large Cap companies, most of which are U.S.
corporations.  For further discussion regarding capital strategy and
resources, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition - Financing Activities.

Competition

As one of the original participants in the growth of the
shopping center industry and one of the nation's largest owners and operators of
neighborhood and community shopping centers, the Company has established close
relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers and
maintains a broad network of industry contacts.  Management is associated
with and/or actively participates in many shopping center and REIT industry
organizations.  Notwithstanding these relationships, there are numerous
regional and local commercial developers, real estate companies, financial
institutions and other investors who compete with the Company for the
acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking
tenants who will lease space in the Company’s properties.

Operating Practices

Nearly all operating functions, including leasing, legal,
construction, data processing, maintenance, finance and accounting, are
administered by the Company from its executive offices in New Hyde Park, New
York and supported by the Company’s regional offices.  The Company believes
it is critical to have a management presence in its principal areas of operation
and accordingly, the Company maintains regional offices in various cities
throughout the United States.  As of December 31, 2007, a total of 682
persons are employed at the Company's executive and regional offices.

The Company's regional offices are generally staffed by a
regional business leader and the operating personnel necessary to both function
as local representatives for leasing and promotional purposes, to complement the
corporate office’s administrative and accounting efforts and to ensure that
property inspection and maintenance objectives are achieved.  The regional
offices are important in reducing the time necessary to respond to the needs of
the Company's tenants.  Leasing and maintenance personnel from the
corporate office also conduct regular inspections of each shopping center.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company also employs a total
of 44 persons at several of its larger properties in order to more effectively
administer its maintenance and security responsibilities.

Qualification as a REIT

The Company has elected, commencing with its taxable year
which began January 1, 1992, to qualify as a REIT under the Code.  If, as
the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to
qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company generally
will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its
stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income as defined
under the Code.

In connection with the RMA, the Company’s taxable
subsidiaries may participate in activities from which the Company was previously
precluded, subject to certain limitations.  The primary activities of the
Company’s taxable REIT subsidiaries during 2007 included, but were not limited
to, (i) the ground-up development of shopping center properties and subsequent
sale thereof upon completion (see Recent Developments - Ground-Up Development),
(ii) real estate advisory and disposition services, including the Company’s
investment in Albertson’s described below and (iii) acting as an agent or
principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions.  The
Company was subject to federal and state income taxes on the income from these
activities.

Recent Developments

The following describes the Company’s significant
transactions completed during the year ended December 31, 2007. (See Notes 3, 4
and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual
report on Form 10-K.)


Operating Properties
- -

Acquisitions
- -

During 2007, the Company acquired, in separate
transactions, 43 operating properties, comprising an aggregate 3.6 million
square feet of GLA for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.0
billion, including the assumption of approximately $114.3 million of
non-recourse mortgage debt encumbering nine of the properties.

Dispositions
- -

During 2007, the Company (i) disposed of six operating
properties and completed partial sales of three operating properties, in
separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $40.0
million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $6.4 million,
after income tax of approximately $1.6 million, and (ii) transferred one
operating property, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2007, to a joint
venture in which the Company holds a 15% non-controlling ownership interest for
an aggregate price of approximately $4.5 million, which represented the net book
value.

Additionally, during 2007, two consolidated joint
ventures in which the Company had preferred equity investments disposed of, in
separate transactions, their respective properties for an aggregate sales price
of approximately $66.5 million.  As a result of these capital transactions,
the Company received approximately $22.1 million of profit participation, before
minority interest of approximately $5.6 million.  This profit participation
has been recorded as income from other real estate investments and is reflected
in Income from discontinued operating properties in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Redevelopments -

The Company has an ongoing program to reformat and
re-tenant its properties to maintain or enhance its competitive position in the
marketplace.  During 2007, the Company substantially completed the
redevelopment and re-tenanting of various operating properties.  The
Company expended approximately $70.1 million in connection with these major
redevelopments and re-tenanting projects during 2007. The Company is currently
involved in redeveloping several other shopping centers in the existing
portfolio.  The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward these and
other redevelopment projects will be approximately $90.0 million to $110.0
million during 2008.

Ground-Up Development -

The Company is engaged in ground-up development projects
which consist of (i) merchant building through the Company’s wholly-owned
taxable REIT subsidiaries, which develop neighborhood and community shopping
centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) U.S. ground-up
development projects which will be held as long-term investments by the Company
and (iii) various ground-up development projects located in Mexico for long-term
investment (see Recent Developments - International Real Estate Investments and
Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual
report on Form 10-K).  The ground-up development projects generally have
significant pre-leasing prior to the commencement of construction. As of
December 31, 2007, the Company had in progress a total of 60 ground-up
development projects including 27 merchant building projects, nine U.S.
ground-up development projects, and 24 ground-up development projects located
throughout Mexico.

Merchant Building -

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had in progress 27
merchant building projects located in 13 states.  During 2007, the Company
expended approximately $269.6 million in connection with the purchase of land
and construction costs related to these projects and those sold during 2007.
 As part of the Company’s ongoing analysis of its merchant building
projects, the Company has determined that for two of its projects, located in
Jacksonville, FL and Anchorage, AK, the recoverable value will not exceed their
estimated cost.  This is primarily due to adverse changes in local market
conditions and the uncertainty of those conditions in the future.  As a
result, the Company has recorded an aggregate pre-tax adjustment of property
carrying value on these projects for the year ended December 31, 2007, of $8.5
million, representing the excess of the carrying values of the projects over
their estimated fair values.


The Company anticipates its
capital commitment toward its merchant building projects will be approximately
$200.0 million to $250.0 million during 2008.  The proceeds from the sale
of completed ground-up development projects during 2008, proceeds from
construction loans and availability under the Company’s revolving lines of
credit are expected to be sufficient to fund these anticipated capital
requirements.

Acquisitions -

During 2007, the Company acquired six land parcels, in
separate transactions, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $69.8
million.  The estimated project costs for these newly acquired parcels are
approximately $95.2 million with completion dates ranging from October 2008 to
June 2010.

During 2007, the Company obtained individual construction
loans on five merchant building projects and assumed one loan in connection with
the acquisition of a merchant building project.  Additionally, the Company
repaid construction loans on three merchant building projects. At December 31,
2007, total loan commitments on the Company’s 15 outstanding construction loans
aggregated approximately $360.3 million of which approximately $245.9 million
has been funded.  These loans have scheduled maturities ranging from one
month to 33 months (excluding any extension options which may be available to the Company) and bear interest at rates ranging from 6.78% to 7.48% at
December 31, 2007.

Dispositions -

During 2007, the Company sold, in separate transactions,
(i) four of its recently completed merchant building projects, (ii) 26
out-parcels, (iii) 74.3 acres of undeveloped land and (iv) completed partial
sales of two projects, for an aggregate total proceeds of approximately $310.5
million and received approximately $3.3 million of proceeds from completed
earn-out requirements on previously sold projects.  These sales resulted in
pre-tax gains of approximately $40.1 million.

U.S. Long-Term Investment Projects
- -

During 2007, the Company expended approximately $7.7
million in connection with the purchase of undeveloped land in Union, NJ, which
will be developed into a 0.2 million square foot retail center and approximately
$21.5 million in connection with the purchase of three redevelopment properties
located in Bronx, NY, which will be redeveloped into mixed-use
residential/retail centers aggregating 0.1 million square feet.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had in progress a
total of nine U.S. long-term investment projects. The Company anticipates
its capital commitment toward these projects will be approximately $60.0 million
to $80.0 million during 2008.  The proceeds from construction loans and
availability under the Company’s revolving lines of credit are expected to be
sufficient to fund these anticipated capital requirements.

Kimsouth -

During June 2006, Kimsouth, a consolidated taxable REIT
subsidiary in which the Company holds a 92.5% controlling interest, contributed
approximately $51.0 million to fund its 15% non-controlling interest in a newly
formed joint venture with an investment group to acquire a portion of
Albertson’s Inc.  To maximize investment returns, the investment group’s
strategy with respect to this joint venture, includes refinancing, selling
selected stores and enhancing operations at the remaining stores.  During
2007, this joint venture completed the disposition of certain operating stores
and a refinancing of the remaining assets in the joint venture.  As a
result of these transactions Kimsouth received cash distributions of
approximately $148.6 million.  Kimsouth has a remaining capital commitment
obligation to fund up to an additional $15.0 million for general purposes.
 Due to this remaining capital commitment, $15.0 million is included in
Other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

During 2007, Kimsouth’s income from the Albertson’s joint
venture aggregated approximately $49.6 million, net of income tax.  This
amount includes (i) an operating loss of approximately $15.1 million, net of an
income tax benefit of approximately $10.1 million, (ii) distribution in excess
of Kimsouth’s investment of approximately $10.4 million, net


of income tax expense of
approximately $6.9 million and (iii) an extraordinary gain of approximately
$54.3 million, net of income tax expense of approximately $36.2 million,
resulting from purchase price allocation adjustments.  Additionally, the
Company reduced the valuation allowance that was applied against the Kimsouth
net operating losses ("NOLs") resulting in an income tax benefit of
approximately $31.2 million.  (See Notes 3 and 22 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form
10-K.)

Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2007,
the Albertson’s joint venture acquired two operating properties for
approximately $20.3 million, including the assumption of $18.5 million in
non-recourse mortgage debt.

Company has non-controlling interests transferred 17 operating properties for an
aggregate sales price of approximately $825.2 million, including approximately
$427.1 million of non-recourse mortgage debt, to newly formed joint ventures in
which the Company holds 15% non-controlling ownership interests and manages.
 As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized profit
participation of approximately $3.7 million and deferred its share of the gain
related to its remaining ownership interest in the properties.

Also, during 2007, joint ventures in which the Company
has non-controlling interests sold six operating properties to the Company for a
sales price of approximately $151.9 million including the assumption of $50.3

Item 1A. Risk Factors

We are subject to certain business risks
including, among other factors, the following:

Loss of our tax status as a real estate
investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value
of our securities.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income
tax purposes under the Code.  We currently intend to operate so as to
qualify as a REIT and believe that our current organization and method of
operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal
income tax code to enable us to qualify as a REIT.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of
highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there
are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations.  The
determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within
our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  New legislation,
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could
significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT, the
federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an
investment in a REIT relative to other investments.  There can be no
assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for tax
purposes.

If we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax
consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends
to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT:

·

we would not be allowed a deduction
for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be
subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

·

we could be subject to the federal
alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes;


·

unless we were entitled to relief
under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT
for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified;
and

·

we would not be required to make
distributions to stockholders.

As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify
as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and
could adversely affect the value of our securities.

Adverse market conditions and competition may impede our
ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain
properties.

The economic performance and value of our properties is
subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate
including:

·

changes in the national, regional and
local economic climate;

·

local conditions, including an
oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that
we own;

·

the attractiveness of our properties
to tenants;

·

the ability of tenants to pay
rent;

·

competition from other available
properties;

·

changes in market rental rates;

·

the need to periodically pay for
costs to repair, renovate and re-let space;

·

changes in operating costs, including
costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes;

·

the fact that the expenses of owning
and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as
market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties;
and

·

changes in laws and governmental
regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and
taxes.

Downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a
direct impact on our performance.

Our properties consist primarily of community and
neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. Our performance
therefore is linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space
generally.  The market for retail space could in the future be adversely
affected by:

·

weakness in the national, regional
and local economies;

·

the adverse financial condition of
some large retailing companies;

·

ongoing consolidation in the retail
sector;

·

the excess amount of retail space in
a number of markets; and

·

increasing consumer purchases through
catalogues and the internet.

Failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple
locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its
financial condition or otherwise, could impact our performance.


Our performance depends on our
ability to collect rent from tenants. At any time, our tenants may experience a
downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial
condition. As a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements,
decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments
when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result
in the termination of the tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income
attributable to the terminated leases.  In addition, lease terminations by
an anchor tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises could
result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same
shopping centers under the terms of some leases. In that event, we may be unable
to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all.  The
occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves
a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could impact our
performance.

We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in
bankruptcy.

A tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not
continue to pay us rent. A bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our
tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect
pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property,
unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so.  A tenant or lease
guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under
the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. If a
lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general
unsecured claim for damages.  As a result, it is likely that we would
recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds,
if at all.

We may be unable to sell our real estate property
investments when appropriate or on favorable terms.

Real estate property investments are illiquid and
generally cannot be disposed of quickly. In addition, the federal tax code
imposes restrictions on a REIT’s ability to dispose of properties that are not
applicable to other types of real estate companies.  Therefore, we may not
be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions
promptly or on favorable terms.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other
real estate related companies and this may create risks.

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other
real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development
is consistent with our business strategies. We may not succeed in consummating
desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. We
face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that
could increase our costs.  When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we
may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents
sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations.
 Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or
time-consuming and could divert management’s attention.  Acquisitions or
developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of
market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance.  We may
also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that it has begun pursuing
and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted
management time to a matter not consummated.  Furthermore, our acquisitions
of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those
properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of
acquisition.  In addition, development of our existing properties presents
similar risks.

There is a lack of operating history with respect to our
recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the
integration or management of additional properties.

These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies
currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential.  It
is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline
under our management.  As we acquire additional properties, we will be
subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and
tenant retention.  In addition, our ability to manage our growth
effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into
our existing management structure.  We may not succeed with this
integration or effectively manage additional properties. Also, newly acquired
properties may not perform as expected.

We do not have exclusive control over our joint venture
and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our
objectives will be pursued.


We have invested in some cases
as a co-venturer or partner in properties instead of owning directly.  In
these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development,
financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. As a
result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are
inconsistent with us, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede
our objectives. The co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or
bankrupt.

We may not be able to recover our investments in our
joint venture or preferred equity investments, which may result in losses to
us.

Our joint venture and preferred equity investments
generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and
value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real
estate as described above.

We have significant international operations that carry
additional risks.

We invest in, and conduct operations outside the United
States.  The risks we face in international business operations include,
but are not limited to:

·

currency risks, including currency
fluctuations;

·

unexpected changes in legislative and
regulatory requirements;

·

potential adverse tax burdens;

·

burdens of complying with different
permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws;

·

obstacles to the repatriation of
earnings and cash;

·

regional, national and local
political uncertainty;

·

economic slowdown and/or downturn in
foreign markets;

·

difficulties in staffing and managing
international operations; and

·

reduced protection for intellectual
property in some countries.

Each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair
our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

We may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and
equities market, which may have a material adverse effect on our growth
strategy, our results of operations, and our financial condition.

Market conditions may make it difficult to obtain
financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional
debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain it on favorable
terms. The inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our
business, such as:

·

We could have difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which could materially
adversely affect our business strategy;

·

Our liquidity
could be adversely affected;

·

We may be
unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness;

·

We may need
to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on
unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; and

·

We may need
to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of
our existing shareholders.

Financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict
our operating and acquisition activities.

Our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under
which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and
operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as
well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell
all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations
and certain acquisitions.  These covenants may restrict our ability to
pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that
might otherwise be advantageous.  In addition, failure to meet any of the
financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some
or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on
us.

We may be subject to environmental regulations.

Under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances
and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and
may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or
toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other
potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including
governmental fines and injuries to persons and property).  This liability
may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or was responsible for, the
presence of hazardous or toxic substances.

We face competition in leasing or developing
properties

.


We face competition in the
acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others
engaged in real estate investment.  Some of these competitors have greater
financial resources than us.  This results in competition for the
acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our
existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate
investment opportunities.

Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the
market price of our publicly traded securities.

As with other publicly traded securities, the market
price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions,
which may change from time-to-time.  Among the market conditions that may
affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following:

·

the extent of institutional investor
interest in us;

·

the reputation of REITs generally and
the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us;

·

the attractiveness of the securities
of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including
securities issued by other real estate companies);

·

our financial condition and
performance;

·

the market’s perception of our growth
potential and potential future cash dividends;

·

an increase in market interest rates,
which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in
relation to the price paid for our shares; and

·

general economic and financial market
conditions.

We may not be able to recover our investments in
marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in losses to
us.

Our investments in marketable securities are subject to
specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including
the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in
losses to us.  Marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also
be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer.  As a result,
investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of:

·

limited liquidity in the secondary
trading market;

·

substantial market price volatility
resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates;

·

subordination to the prior claims of
banks and other senior lenders to the issuer;

·

the possibility that earnings of the
issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution
obligations; and

·

the declining creditworthiness and
potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates
and economic downturn.

These risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding
marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution
payments.

We invest in mortgage receivables.  Our investments
in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any
institution or agency.  In the event of a default by a borrower it may be
necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations.
 Delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and
selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns.
 Furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property
securing the mortgage may decrease. A decline in real estate values will
adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing
our loans.


Our mortgage receivables may
be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax
liens. In these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by
making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it
entirely.  In these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our
total investment, resulting in a loss. In the event of a major loan default or
several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage
receivables would be materially and adversely affected.

Item 2.  Properties

Real Estate Portfolio

As of December 31,
2007, the Company's real estate portfolio was comprised of interests in
approximately 154.6 million square feet of GLA in 1,391 operating properties
primarily consisting of neighborhood and community shopping centers, and 19
retail store leases located in 45 states, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Chile.
 This 154.6 million square feet of GLA does not include 17 properties under
development comprising 2.5 million square feet of GLA related to the Preferred
Equity program, 30 property interest comprising 0.6 million square feet of GLA
related to FNC Realty, 401 property interests comprising 2.3 million square feet
of GLA related to a net lease portfolio, 55 property interest comprising 2.8
million square feet of GLA related to the NewKirk Portfolio and 20.5 million
square feet of planned GLA for 60 ground-up development projects.  The
Company’s portfolio includes interests ranging from 5% to 50% in 471 shopping
center properties comprising approximately 72.4 million square feet of GLA
relating to the Company’s investment management programs and other joint
ventures.  Neighborhood and community shopping centers comprise the primary
focus of the Company's current portfolio.  As of December 31, 2007, the
Company’s total shopping center portfolio, representing 100% of total GLA of
124.0 million from 886 properties, was approximately 96.3% leased.

The Company's neighborhood and community shopping center
properties, which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint
ventures, had an average size of approximately 140,000 square feet as of
December 31, 2007.  The Company generally retains its shopping centers for
long-term investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical
maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and
increase the value of its properties.  These projects usually include
renovating existing facades, installing uniform signage, resurfacing parking
lots and enhancing parking lot lighting.  During 2007, the Company
capitalized approximately $9.1 million in connection with these property
improvements and expensed to operations approximately $19.7 million.

The Company's neighborhood and community shopping centers
are usually "anchored" by a national or regional discount department store,
supermarket or drugstore.  As one of the original participants in the
growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nation's largest owners
and operators of shopping centers, the Company has established close
relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers.
 Some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the
Company's shopping center properties include The Home Depot, TJX Companies,
Sears Holdings, Kohl’s, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Linens N Things, Royal Ahold, Bed
Bath and Beyond, and Costco.

A substantial portion of the Company's income consists of
rent received under long-term leases.  Most of the leases provide for the
payment of fixed-base rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants
of an allocable share of the real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and common
area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers.
 Although many of the leases require the Company to make roof and
structural repairs as needed, a number of tenant leases place that
responsibility on the tenant, and the Company's standard small store lease
provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area
maintenance.  The Company's management places a strong emphasis on sound
construction and safety at its properties.

Approximately 24.3% of the Company's leases also
contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a
percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds.
 Percentage rents accounted for less than 1% of the Company's revenues from
rental property for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Minimum base rental revenues and operating expense
reimbursements accounted for approximately 99% of the Company's total revenues
from rental property for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The Company's
management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the
Company's existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing market-rate
base rents in the geographic regions where the Company operates, reflecting the
potential for future growth.


For the period January 1, 2007
to December 31, 2007, the Company increased the average base rent per leased
square foot in its consolidated portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping
centers from $9.86 to $10.30, an increase of $0.44.  This increase
primarily consists of (i) a $0.25 increase relating to acquisitions, (ii) a
$0.07 increase relating to dispositions or the transfer of properties to various
joint venture entities and (iii) a $0.12 increase relating to new leases signed
net of leases vacated and rent step-ups within the portfolio.  As of
December 31, 2007, the Company’s consolidated portfolio was 95.9% leased.

The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing
risks through geographic and tenant diversity.  No single neighborhood and
community shopping center accounted for more than 0.8% of the Company's total
shopping center GLA or more than 1.7% of total annualized base rental revenues
as of December 31, 2007. The Company’s five largest tenants at December 31,
2007, were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohl’s and Wal-Mart,
which represent approximately 3.2%, 2.8%, 2.3%, 2.0% and 1.9%, respectively, of
the Company’s annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share
of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a
100% economic interest.  The Company maintains an active leasing and
capital improvement program that, combined with the high quality of the
locations, has made, in management's opinion, the Company's properties
attractive to tenants.

The Company's management believes its experience in the
real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional
tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among
a large number of property owners.

Retail Store Leases

In addition to
neighborhood and community shopping centers, as of December 31, 2007, the
Company had interests in retail store leases totaling approximately 1.8 million
square feet of anchor stores in 19 neighborhood and community shopping centers
located in 13 states.  As of December 31, 2007, approximately 97.4% of the
space in these anchor stores had been sublet to retailers that lease the stores
under net lease agreements providing for average annualized base rental payments
of $4.09 per square foot. The average annualized base rental payments under the
Company’s retail store leases to the landowners of such subleased stores are
approximately $2.54 per square foot.  The average remaining primary term of
the retail store leases (and, similarly, the remaining primary term of the
sublease agreements with the tenants currently leasing such space) is
approximately two years, excluding options to renew the leases for terms which
generally range from five years to 20 years.  The Company’s investment in
retail store leases is included in the caption Other real estate investments on
the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Ground-Leased Properties

The Company has
interests in 79 shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground
leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the
Company (or an affiliated joint venture) to construct and/or operate a shopping
center.  The Company or the joint venture pays rent for the use of the land
and generally is responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the
building and improvements.  At the end of these long-term leases, unless
extended, the land together with all improvements revert to the landowner.

Ground-Up Development Properties

The Company
is engaged in ground-up development projects which consists of (i) merchant
building through the Company’s wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which
develop neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale
thereof upon completion, (ii) U.S. ground-up development projects which will be
held as long-term investments by the Company and (iii) various ground-up
development projects located in Mexico for long-term investment (see Recent
Developments - International Real Estate Investments and Note 3 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K).
 The ground-up development projects generally have significant pre-leasing
prior to the commencement of the construction.  As of December 31, 2007,
the Company had in progress a total of 60 ground-up development projects
including 27 merchant building projects, nine U.S. ground-up development
projects and 24 ground-up development projects located throughout Mexico.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had in progress 27
merchant building projects located in 13 states, which are expected to be sold
upon completion.  These projects had significant pre-leasing prior to the
commencement of construction.  As of December 31, 2007, the average annual
base rent per leased square foot for the merchant building portfolio was $16.48
and the average annual base rent per leased square foot for new leases executed
in 2007 was $18.19.

Undeveloped Land

The Company owns certain
unimproved land tracts and parcels of land adjacent to certain of its existing
shopping centers that are held for possible expansion. At times, should
circumstances warrant, the Company may develop or dispose of these parcels.

 The Company’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under
the trading symbol "KIM".

(a)

stockholders of record on January 2, 2008.

(b)

Paid on January 16, 2007, to
stockholders of record on January 2, 2007.

Holders

The number of holders of record of
the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, was 3,442 as of January
31, 2008.

Dividends

Since the IPO, the Company has
paid regular quarterly dividends to its stockholders. While the Company intends
to continue paying regular quarterly dividends, future dividend declarations
will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the
actual cash flow of the Company, its financial condition, capital requirements,
the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and
such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Company is
required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to distribute at
least 90% of its REIT taxable income. The actual cash flow available to pay
dividends will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenues
received from rental properties, the operating expenses of the Company, the
interest expense on its borrowings, the ability of lessees to meet their
obligations to the Company and any unanticipated capital expenditures.

The Company has determined that the $1.48 dividend per
common share paid during 2007 represented 56% ordinary income, 35% in capital
gains and a 9% return of capital to its stockholders.  The $1.35 dividend
per common share paid during 2006 represented 66% ordinary income, 28% in
capital gains and a 6% return of capital to its stockholders.

In addition to its common stock offerings, the Company
has capitalized the growth in its business through the issuance of unsecured
fixed and floating-rate medium-term notes, underwritten bonds, mortgage debt and
construction loans, convertible preferred stock and perpetual preferred stock.
 Borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities have also been
an interim source of funds to both finance the purchase of properties and other
investments and meet any short-term working capital requirements.  The
various instruments governing the Company's issuance of its unsecured public
debt, bank debt, mortgage debt and preferred stock impose certain restrictions
on the Company with regard to dividends, voting, liquidation and other
preferential rights available to the holders of such instruments.  See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" and Notes 11 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.


The Company does not believe
that the preferential rights available to the holders of its Class F Preferred
Stock and Class G Preferred Stock, the financial covenants contained in its
public bond indentures, as amended, or its revolving credit agreements will have
an adverse impact on the Company's ability to pay dividends in the normal course
to its common stockholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain its
qualification as a REIT.

The Company maintains a dividend reinvestment and direct
stock purchase plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which common and preferred
stockholders and other interested investors may elect to automatically reinvest
their dividends to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock or, through
optional cash payments, purchase shares of the Company’s common stock.  The
Company may, from time-to-time, either (i) purchase shares of its common stock
in the open market or (ii) issue new shares of its common stock for the purpose
of fulfilling its obligations under the Plan.

Total Stockholder Return Performance

The
following performance chart compares, over the five years ended December 31,
2007, the cumulative total stockholder return on the Company’s common stock with
the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and the cumulative total
return of the NAREIT Equity REIT Total Return Index (the "NAREIT Equity Index")
prepared and published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts ("NAREIT").  Equity real estate investment trusts are defined as
those which derive more than 75% of their income from equity investments in real
estate assets.  The NAREIT Equity Index includes all tax qualified equity
real estate investment trusts listed on the New York Stock Exchange, American
Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System.  Stockholder return
performance, presented quarterly for the five years ended December 31, 2007, is
not necessarily indicative of future results.  All stockholder return
performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends.

Executive Summary

Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nation’s largest
publicly-traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping
centers.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company had interests in 1,973
properties totaling approximately 183 million square feet of GLA located in 45
states, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Chile.

The Company is self-administered and self-managed through
present management, which has owned and managed neighborhood and community
shopping centers for over 45 years. The executive officers are engaged in the
day-to-day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the Company,
with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management,
maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the
Company.

In connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999
(the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to
participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to
maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long
as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as
taxable subsidiaries under the Code, subject to certain limitations.  As
such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various
retail real estate-related opportunities including (i) merchant building,
through its wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are primarily engaged
in the ground-up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and
the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory
and disposition services, which primarily focus on leasing and disposition
strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed
and/or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in
connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company will consider
other investments through taxable REIT subsidiaries should suitable
opportunities arise.

In addition, the Company continues to capitalize on its
established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in
which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management,
leasing and operational support for those properties.  The Company also
provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides
real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed
retailers.  The Company also makes selective investments in secondary
market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management’s
judgment, priced below the value of the underlying real estate.

The Company’s strategy is to maintain a strong balance
sheet while investing opportunistically and selectively. The Company intends to
continue to execute its plan of delivering solid growth in earnings and
dividends.  As a result of the improved 2007 performance, the Board of
Directors increased the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.40 from $0.36,
effective for the third quarter of 2007.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company
include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all
entities in which the Company has a controlling interest including where the
Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest
entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46
(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, or meets certain criteria of a
sole general partner or managing member in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investor’s Accounting for an Investment in a Limited
Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited
Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5").  The Company applies these
provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the
cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate.  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.  In
preparing these financial


statements, management has
made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities.  These estimates are based on, but not limited to,
historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving
due consideration to materiality.  The most significant assumptions and
estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts
receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate, joint venture
investments and realizability of deferred tax assets.  Application of these
assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and,
as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts
Receivable

Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized
on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these
leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved
by the lessee.  These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales
level is achieved.  Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as
earned.  Rental income may also include payments received in connection
with lease termination agreements.  In addition, leases typically provide
for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes
and other operating expenses.

The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of
its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other
revenues.  The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt
levels, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.  In addition, tenants
in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the
expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims.  The Company’s
reported net income is directly affected by management’s estimate of the
collectability of accounts receivable.

Real Estate

The Company’s investments in real estate properties are
stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  Significant
renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset,
are capitalized.

Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the
Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (primarily
consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and
identified intangible assets and liabilities (primarily consisting of above and
below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships), assumed debt and
redeemable units issued in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations.  Based on these
estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and
liabilities.  The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by
independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and
liabilities.  The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are
evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being
accounted for over the revised remaining useful life.

Depreciation and amortization are provided on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as
follows:

Buildings
and building improvements

15 to 50 years

Fixtures,
leasehold and tenant improvements

Terms of leases or useful lives,
whichever is shorter

(including certain identified
intangible assets)

The Company is required to make subjective assessments as
to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of
depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties.
 These assessments have a direct impact on the Company’s net income.

Real estate under development on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets represents ground-up development of neighborhood and
community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion
and projects which the Company may hold as long-term investments.  These
assets are carried at cost.  The cost of land and buildings under
development includes specifically identifiable costs.  The capitalized
costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the
property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate
taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs
incurred during the period of development.  The Company ceases cost
capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon
substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from
the


completion of major
construction activity.  If, in management’s opinion, the estimated net
sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, an adjustment
to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of
the property.  A gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized
using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66,
Accounting for Real Estate Sales.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint
Ventures

The Company accounts for its investments in
unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the
Company exercises significant influence, but does not control, these entities.
 These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted
for cash contributions and distributions.  Earnings for each investment are
recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where
applicable, based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book
value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each
reporting period.

The Company’s joint ventures and other real estate
investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other
joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties,
consistent with its core business.  These joint ventures typically obtain
non-recourse third-party financing on their property investments, thus
contractually limiting the Company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its
equity investment, and due to the lender’s exposure to losses, a lender
typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk.
 The Company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint
ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments.

On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there
are any indicators that the value of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated
joint ventures may be impaired. An investment’s value is impaired only if
management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the
carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other than
temporary.  To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be
measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the
estimated fair value of the investment.

Long Lived Assets

On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there
are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties (including any
related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired.  A
property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current
and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges)
of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying
value of the property.  Such cash flow projections consider factors such as
expected future operating income, trends, and prospects, as well as the effects
of demand, competition and other factors.  To the extent impairment has
occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to
reflect the estimated fair value of the property.

When a real estate asset is identified by management as
held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the
sales price of such asset net of selling costs.  If, in management’s
opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of
such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the
estimated fair value of the property.

The Company is required to make subjective assessments as
to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties,
investments in joint ventures and other investments.  The Company’s
reported net income is directly affected by management’s estimate of impairments
and/or valuation allowances.

Results of Operations

Comparison 2007 to 2006


(1)

Revenues from rental property
increased primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of operating
properties during 2006 and 2007, providing incremental revenues of approximately
$85.5 million, (ii) an overall occupancy increase from the consolidated shopping
center portfolio to 95.9% at December 31, 2007, as compared to 95.1% at December
31, 2006, due to growth in rental rates from renewing expiring leases, the
completion of certain redevelopment and development projects and tenant buyouts
providing incremental revenues of approximately $14.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007 as compared to the corresponding period in 2006, offset by
(iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $6.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007 as compared to the corresponding period in 2006, resulting
from the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint
venture entities, and the sale of certain properties during 2007 and 2006.

(2)

Rental property expenses increased
primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2007 and 2006 which were
partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred
to various joint venture entities.

(3)

Depreciation and amortization
increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2007 and 2006
which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those
transferred to various joint venture entities.

Mortgage and other financing income decreased $4.6
million to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to
$18.8 million for the corresponding period in 2006. This decrease is primarily
due to the recognition of accretion income of approximately $6.2 million,
resulting from the early prepayment of a mortgage receivable in 2006 partially
offset by an overall increase in interest income on mortgage receivables entered
into in 2007 and 2006.

Management and other fee income increased approximately
$14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the
corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased
property management fees and other transaction related fees related to the
growth in the Company’s co-investment programs.

General and administrative expenses increased
approximately $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to
the corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to
personnel-related costs, primarily due to growth within the Company’s
co-investment programs and the overall continued growth of the Company.

Interest, dividends and other investment income decreased
approximately $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to
the corresponding period in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease
in realized gains resulting from the sale of certain marketable securities
during 2007 as compared to the corresponding period in 2006.

Other (expense)/income, net decreased approximately $19.5
million to $10.6 million of an expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, as
compared to $8.9 million in income for the corresponding period in 2006.
 This decrease is primarily due to (i) the receipt of fewer shares during
2007 as compared to 2006 of Sears Holding Corp. common stock received as partial
settlement of Kmart pre-petition claims and (ii) an increase in Canadian
withholding charges on profit participation proceeds received during 2007
relating to capital transactions from a Canadian preferred equity
investment.

Interest expense increased approximately $43.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in
2006.  This increase is due to higher interest rates and higher outstanding
levels of debt during the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the same
period in 2006.

Benefit for income taxes increased $48.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in 2006.
 This increase is primarily due to the reduction of approximately $31.2
million of NOL valuation allowance and a tax benefit of approximately $10.1
million from operating losses recognized in connection with the Albertson’s
investment.


Equity in income of real
estate joint ventures, net increased $67.8 million to $173.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $105.5 million for the
corresponding period in 2006. This increase is primarily the result of (i) an
increase in equity in income from the Kimco Realty Opportunity Portfolio
("KROP") joint venture investment primarily resulting from profit participation
of approximately $39.3 million and gains on sale/transfer of operating
properties during 2007 of which the Company’s share of gains were $12.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007, (ii) an increase in equity in income from
the Kimco Income Opportunity Portfolio ("KIR") joint venture investment
primarily resulting from gains on sale of operating properties during 2007 of
which the Company’s share of gains was $20.7 million for the year ended December
31, 2007 and (iii) the Company’s growth of its various other real estate joint
ventures due to additional capital investments for the acquisition of additional
operating properties by the ventures throughout 2007 and 2006, partially offset
by net operating losses and excess cash distribution from the Albertson’s joint
venture of approximately $7.9 million during 2007.

During 2007, the Company sold, in separate transactions,
(i) four recently completed merchant building projects, (ii) 26 out-parcels,
(iii) 74.3 acres of undeveloped land and (iv) completed partial sales of two
projects, for aggregate total proceeds of approximately $310.5 million and
approximately $3.3 million of proceeds from completed earn-out requirements on
previously sold projects.  These transactions resulted in gains of
approximately $24.1 million, after income taxes of $16.0 million.

As part of the Company’s ongoing analysis of its merchant
building projects, the Company has determined that for two of its projects,
located in Jacksonville, FL and Anchorage, AK, the recoverable value will not
exceed their estimated cost.  This is primarily due to adverse changes in
local market conditions and the uncertainty of those conditions in the future.
 As a result, the Company has recorded an aggregate pre-tax adjustment of
property carrying value on these projects for the year ended December 31, 2007,
of $8.5 million, representing the excess of the carrying value of the projects
over their estimated fair value.

During 2006, the Company sold six recently completed
merchant building projects, its partnership interest in one project and 30
out-parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $260.0 million.
 These sales resulted in gains of approximately $25.1 million, after income
taxes of $12.2 million.  These gains exclude approximately $1.1 million of
gain relating to one project, which was deferred due to the Company’s continued
ownership interest.

During 2007, the Company (i) disposed of six operating
properties and completed partial sales of three operating properties, in
separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $40.0
million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $6.4 million,
after income tax of approximately $1.6 million and (ii) transferred one
operating property, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2007, to a joint
venture in which the Company holds a 15% non-controlling ownership interest for
an aggregate price of approximately $4.5 million, which represented the net book
value.

Additionally, during 2007, two consolidated joint
ventures in which the Company had preferred equity investments disposed of, in
separate transactions, their respective properties for an aggregate sales price
of approximately $66.5 million.  As a result of these capital transactions,
the Company received approximately $22.1 million of profit participation, before
minority interest of approximately $5.6 million.  This profit participation
has been recorded as income from other real estate investments and is reflected
in Income from discontinued operating properties in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Income.

During 2006, the Company disposed of (i) 28 operating
properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of $270.5 million,
which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $71.7 million, net of
income taxes of $2.8 million relating to the sale of two properties, and (ii)
transferred five operating properties, to joint ventures in which the Company
has 20% non-controlling interests for an aggregate price of approximately $95.4
million, which resulted in a gain of approximately $1.4 million from one
transferred property.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
$442.8 million or $1.65 on a diluted per share basis as compared to $428.3
million or $1.70 on a diluted per share basis for the corresponding period in
2006.  This change is primarily attributable to (i) an increase in revenues
from rental properties primarily due to acquisitions of operating properties
during 2007 and 2006, (ii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint
ventures achieved from profit participation and gains on sale of joint venture
operating properties and additional capital investments in the Company’s joint
venture programs for the acquisition of additional operating properties
throughout 2007 and 2006,


(iii) earnings of $75.5
million related to the Albertson’s investment monetization, partially offset by,
(iv) a decrease in income resulting from the sale of certain marketable
securities during the corresponding period in 2006 and (v) a decrease in gains
on sale of operating properties in 2007 as compared to 2006.

Comparison 2006 to 2005

(1)

Revenues from
rental property increased primarily from the combined effect of (i) the
acquisition of operating properties during 2006 and 2005, providing incremental
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 of approximately $72.3 million,
(ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 95.1% at
December 31, 2006, as compared to 94.6% at December 31, 2005 and the completion
of certain redevelopment and development projects providing incremental revenues
of approximately $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared
to the corresponding period in 2005, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of
approximately $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to
the corresponding period in 2005, resulting from the transfer of operating
properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities, tenant buyouts, and
the sale of certain properties during 2005 and 2006.

(2)

Rental property
expenses increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2006
and 2005 which were partially offset by operating property dispositions
including those transferred to various joint venture entities.

(3)

Depreciation and
amortization increased primarily due to operating property acquisitions during
2006 and 2005 which were partially offset by operating property dispositions
including those transferred to various joint venture entities.

Mortgage and other financing income decreased $8.8
million to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to
$27.6 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This decrease is primarily
due to the recognition in 2005 of a prepayment fee of $14.0 million received by
the Company relating to the early repayment by Shopko of its outstanding loan
with the Company, offset by accretion income of approximately $6.2 million
received in 2006, resulting from an early prepayment of a mortgage receivable in
June 2006, which had been acquired at a discount.

Management and other fee income increased approximately
$10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the
corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to incremental fees
earned from the Kimsouth portfolio and growth in the Company’s other
co-investment programs.

General and administrative expenses increased
approximately $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to
the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to
personnel-related costs including the non-cash expensing of stock options
granted and the overall continued growth of the Company.

Interest, dividends and other investment income increased
approximately $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to
the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to greater
realized gains on the sale of certain marketable securities and increased
interest and dividend income as a result of higher cash balances and the growth
in the marketable securities portfolio during 2006 as compared to 2005.

Interest expense increased $44.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This
increase is due to higher interest rates and higher outstanding levels of debt
during this period as compared to the same period in the preceding year.


Income from other real estate
investments increased $20.3 million to $77.1 million for the year ended December
31, 2006, as compared to $56.8 million for the corresponding period in 2005.
This increase is primarily due to (i) increased investment in the Company’s
Preferred Equity program which contributed $40.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2006, including $12.2 million of profit participation earned from
16 capital transactions, as compared to $32.8 million for the corresponding
period in 2005, including $12.6 million of profit participation earned from six
capital transactions and (ii) pre-tax profits of $7.9 million from the transfer
of two properties from Kimsouth to a joint venture in which the Company has an
18% non-controlling interest.  These profits exclude amounts that have been
deferred as a result of the Company’s continued ownership interest.

Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net
increased $28.1 million to $105.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
as compared to $77.5 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This increase
is primarily attributable to (i) increase in equity in income from the KROP
joint venture primarily resulting from profit participation of approximately
$22.2 million and gains from the sale of nine operating properties, one land
parcel and one out-parcel during 2006 of which the Company’s share of gains was
$9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, and (ii) the Company’s growth
of its various other real estate joint ventures.  The Company has made
additional capital investments in these and other joint ventures for the
acquisition of additional shopping center properties by the ventures throughout
2006 and 2005.

During 2006, the Company sold six recently completed
merchant building projects, its partnership interest in one project and 30
out-parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $260.0 million.
 These sales resulted in gains of approximately $25.1 million, after income
taxes of $12.2 million.  These gains exclude approximately $1.1 million of
gain relating to one project, which was deferred due to the Company’s continued
ownership interest.

During 2005, the Company sold, in separate transactions,
41 out-parcels and six recently completed merchant building projects for
approximately $264.1 million.  These sales provided gains of approximately
$22.8 million, after income taxes of approximately $10.8 million.

During 2006, the Company disposed of (i) 28 operating
properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of $270.5 million,
which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $71.7 million, net of
income taxes of $2.8 million relating to the sale of two properties, and (ii)
transferred five operating properties, to joint ventures in which the Company
has 20% non-controlling interests for an aggregate price of approximately $95.4
million, which resulted in a gain of approximately $1.4 million from one
transferred property.

During 2005, the Company disposed of, in separate
transactions, (i) 20 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of
approximately $93.3 million, (ii) transferred three operating properties to KROP
for an aggregate price of approximately $49.0 million and (iii) transferred 52
operating properties to various joint ventures in which the Company has
non-controlling interests ranging from 15% to 50% for an aggregate price of
approximately $183.1 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2005, these
transactions resulted in gains of approximately $31.9 million and a loss on
sale/transfer from four of the properties for $5.2 million.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
$428.3 million.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $363.6
million.  On a diluted per share basis, net income improved $0.18 to $1.70
for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $1.52 for the corresponding
period in 2005. These increases are attributable to (i) an increase in revenues
from rental properties primarily due to acquisitions in 2006 and 2005, (ii)
increased income from other real estate investments primarily due to increased
investments in the Company’s Preferred Equity program, (iii) an increase in
equity in income of real estate joint ventures achieved from profit
participation and gains on sale of joint venture operating properties and
additional capital investment in the Company’s joint venture programs for the
acquisition of additional operating properties throughout 2006 and 2005, (iv)
increased gains on sales of operating properties in 2006 and (v) increased
income contributed from the marketable securities portfolio in 2006 as compared
to 2005, partially offset by, (vi) an increase in interest expense due to higher
interest rates and increased borrowings during 2006.


Tenant
Concentrations

The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing
risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its
properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base.
 At December 31, 2007, the Company’s five largest tenants were The Home
Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohl’s and Wal-Mart, which represented
approximately 3.2%, 2.8%, 2.3%, 2.0% and 1.9%, respectively, of the Company’s
annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base
rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100%
economic interest.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s capital resources include access to
liquidity in the capital markets, mortgage and construction loan financing and
immediate access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank
commitments of approximately $1.8 billion.

The Company’s cash flow activities are summarized as
follows (in millions):

Operating Activities

Cash flows provided from operating activities for the
year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $666.0 million, as compared to
approximately $455.6 million for the comparable period in 2006.  The
increase of approximately $210.4 million is primarily attributable to increased
cash flows due to (i) the acquisition of properties during 2007 and 2006, (ii)
an increase in revenues from rental properties due to an overall occupancy
increase from the consolidated shopping center portfolio, growth in rental rates
from lease renewals and the completion of certain re-development and development
projects and (iii) an increase in distributions from joint ventures primarily
received from the Company’s investment in KROP resulting from the distribution
of profit participation proceeds and distributions from the Albertson's
investment.

The Company anticipates that cash flows from operating
activities will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and
administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and all dividend
payments in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short term and long
term.  In addition, the Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings
under its revolving credit facilities, issuance of equity and public debt, as
well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital
required by the Company.  Net cash flow provided by operating activities
for the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily attributable to (i) cash
flow from the diverse portfolio of rental properties, (ii) the acquisition of
operating properties during 2007 and 2006, (iii) new leasing, expansion and
re-tenanting of core portfolio properties and (iv) growth in the Company’s joint
venture and Preferred Equity programs.

Investing Activities

Cash flows used for investing activities for the year
ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $1.5 billion, as compared to
approximately $246.2 million for the comparable period in 2006.  This
increase in cash utilization of $1.3 billion resulted primarily from an increase
in acquisition of and improvements to operating real estate and real estate
under development and a decrease in proceeds received from transferred
operating/development properties, partially offset by reimbursements of advances
to real estate joint ventures received in 2007 as compared to 2006.

Acquisitions and
Redevelopments

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
expended approximately $1.0 billion towards acquisition of and improvements to
operating real estate.  (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)


The Company has an ongoing
program to reformat and re-tenant its properties to maintain or enhance its
competitive position in the marketplace.  During the year ended December
31, 2007, the Company expended approximately $70.1 million in connection with
these major redevelopments and re-tenanting projects.  The Company
anticipates its capital commitment toward these and other redevelopment projects
during 2008 will be approximately $90.0 million to $110.0 million.  The
funding of these capital requirements will be provided by cash flow from
operating activities and availability under the Company’s revolving lines of
credit.

Investments and Advances to Real
Estate Joint Ventures

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
expended approximately $413.2 million for investments and advances to real
estate joint ventures and received approximately $293.5 million from
reimbursements of advances to real estate joint ventures.  (See Note 7 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual
report on Form 10-K.)

Ground-up Development

The Company is engaged in ground-up development projects
which consist of (i) merchant building through the Company’s wholly-owned
taxable REIT subsidiaries, which develop neighborhood and community shopping
centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) U.S. ground-up
development projects which will be held as long-term investments by the Company
and (iii) various ground-up development projects located in Mexico for long-term
investment (see Recent Developments - International Real Estate Investments and
Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual
report on Form 10-K).  The ground-up development projects generally have
significant pre-leasing prior to the commencement of construction. As of
December 31, 2007, the Company had in progress a total of 60 ground-up
development projects including 27 merchant building projects, nine U.S.
ground-up development projects, and 24 ground-up development projects located
throughout Mexico.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
expended approximately $640.9 million in connection with the purchase of land
and construction costs related to these projects and those sold during 2007.
 The Company anticipates its capital commitment during 2008 toward these
and other development projects will be approximately $200.0 million to $250.0
million.  The proceeds from the sales of completed ground-up development
projects, proceeds from construction loans and availability under the Company’s
revolving lines of credit are expected to be sufficient to fund these
anticipated capital requirements.

Dispositions and Transfers

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
received net proceeds of approximately $359.2 million relating to the sale of
various operating properties and ground-up development projects and
approximately $69.9 million from the transfer of operating properties to various
joint ventures.  (See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)

Financing Activities

Cash flows provided from financing activities for the
year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $584.1 million, as compared to
approximately $59.4 million for the comparable period in 2006.  This
increase of approximately $524.7 million resulted primarily from (i) an increase
in borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facilities in 2007 due to
increased investment activity during 2007, (ii) an increase in proceeds from
mortgage/construction loan financing and (iii) a decrease in the repayment of
borrowings under the revolving credit facilities in 2007 as compared to 2006,
partially offset by an increase in dividends paid.

It is management’s intention that the Company continually
has access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its
business.  As such, the Company intends to operate with and maintain a
conservative capital structure with a level of debt to total market
capitalization of 50% or less.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company’s
level of debt to total market capitalization was 30%.  In addition, the
Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge
coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its investment-grade
debt ratings.  The Company may, from time-to-time, seek to obtain funds
through additional common and preferred equity offerings, unsecured debt
financings and/or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital
alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a
conservative debt structure.


Since the completion of the
Company’s IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity
markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the
IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt
and equity, raising in the aggregate over $5.7 billion.  Proceeds from
public capital market activities have been used for the purposes of, among other
things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community
shopping centers, funding ground-up development projects, expanding and
improving properties in the portfolio and other investments.  In March
2006, the Company was added to the S & P 500 Index, an index containing the
stock of 500 Large Cap corporations, most of which are U.S. corporations.

During October 2007, the Company established a new $1.5
billion unsecured U.S. revolving credit facility (the "U.S. Credit Facility")
with a group of banks, which is scheduled to expire in October 2011.  This
credit facility, which replaced the Company’s $850.0 million unsecured U.S.
revolving facility, which was scheduled to expire in July 2008, has made
available funds to finance general corporate purposes, including (i) property
acquisitions, (ii) investments in the Company’s institutional management
programs, (iii) development and redevelopment costs and (iv) any short-term
working capital requirements. Interest on borrowings under the U.S. Credit
Facility accrues at LIBOR plus 0.375% and fluctuates in accordance with changes
in the Company’s senior debt ratings.  As part of this U.S. Credit
Facility, the Company has a competitive bid option whereby the Company may
auction up to $750.0 million of its requested borrowings to the bank group.
 This competitive bid option provides the Company the opportunity to obtain
pricing below the currently stated spread.  A facility fee of 0.125% per
annum is payable quarterly in arrears.  As part of the U.S. Credit
Facility, the Company has a $200.0 million sub-limit which provides it the
opportunity to borrow in alternative currencies such as Pounds Sterling,
Japanese Yen or Euros.  Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. Credit Facility,
the Company, among other things, is subject to covenants requiring the
maintenance of (i) maximum leverage ratios on both secured and unsecured debt
and (ii) minimum interest and fixed coverage ratios.  As of December 31,
2007, there was approximately $259.0 million outstanding under this credit
facility, of which approximately $9.0 million (approximately 4.5 million Pounds
Sterling) was outstanding under the alternative currency sub-limit.

The Company also has a three-year CAD $250.0 million
unsecured credit facility with a group of banks.  This facility bore
interest at the CDOR Rate, as defined, plus 0.45%, and was scheduled to expire
in March 2008.  During October 2007, the facility was amended to modify the
covenant package to conform to the Company’s U.S. Credit Facility.  The
facility was further amended in January 2008, to extend the maturity date to
2011, with an additional one-year extension option, at a reduced rate of CDOR
plus 0.375%, subject to change in accordance with the Company’s senior debt
ratings.  Proceeds from this facility are used for general corporate
purposes, including the funding of Canadian denominated investments.  As of
December 31, 2007, there was no outstanding balance under this credit
facility.

Additionally, the Company has a three-year MXP 500.0
million unsecured revolving credit facility.  This facility bears interest
at the TIIE Rate, as defined therein, plus 1.00%, subject to change in
accordance with the Company’s senior debt ratings, and is scheduled to mature in
May 2008 with an additional one-year extension option.  Proceeds from this
facility are used to fund peso denominated investments.  As of December 31,
2007, there was MXP 250.0 million (approximately USD $22.9 million) outstanding
under this credit facility.

The Company is currently negotiating a five-year fixed
rate MXP 1.0 billion term loan.  Proceeds from this loan will be used to
pay the outstanding balance on the MXP 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit
facility and for funding Mexican  denominated investments.

During August 2007, the Company obtained a $200.0 million
unsecured term loan that bore interest at LIBOR plus 0.325%.  The term loan
was scheduled to mature on December 14, 2007.  The Company utilized these
proceeds to partially repay the outstanding balance on the Company’s U.S. Credit
Facility.  The term loan was fully repaid in October 2007.

The Company has a Medium Term Notes ("MTN") program pursuant to which it may,
from time-to-time, offer for sale its senior unsecured debt for any general
corporate purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its
business, including property acquisitions, development and redevelopment costs
and (ii) managing the Company’s debt maturities.  (See Note 11 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form
10-K.)


During April 2007, the Company issued $300.0 million of
ten-year Senior Unsecured Notes at an interest rate of 5.70% per annum payable
semi-annually in arrears.  These notes were sold at 99.984% of par value.
 Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $297.8 million, after
related transaction costs of approximately $2.2 million.  The proceeds from
this issuance were primarily used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance
under the Company’s U.S. Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes.
These notes were issued in conjunction with a fourth supplemental indenture, which
removed the financial covenant requirements for this issuance and future offerings under the
indenture as amended.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
repaid the following senior unsecured notes: (i) its $30.0 million 7.46% fixed
rate notes, which matured on May 20, 2007, (ii) its $55.0 million 5.75% fixed
rate notes, which matured on June 29, 2007, (iii) its $20.0 million 6.96% fixed
rate notes which matured on July 16, 2007, (iv) its $50.0 million 7.86% fixed
rate notes, which matured on November 1, 2007, (v) its $50.0 million 7.90% fixed
rate notes, which matured on December 7, 2007 and (vi) its $10.0 million 6.70%
fixed rate notes, which matured on December 14, 2007.  Additionally, the
Company repaid its $35.0 million 4.96% fixed rate Senior Unsecured Notes, which
matured on November 30, 2007.

In addition to the public equity and debt markets as
capital sources, the Company may, from time-to-time, obtain mortgage financing
on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital
needs of its ground-up development projects.  As of December 31, 2007, the
Company had over 390 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio.

During 2007, the Company (i) obtained an aggregate of
approximately $285.8 million of non-recourse mortgage debt on 12 operating
properties, (ii) assumed approximately $83.7 million of individual non-recourse
mortgage debt relating to the acquisition of eight operating properties,
including approximately $2.5 million of fair value debt adjustments and (iii)
paid off approximately $81.6 million of individual non-recourse mortgage debt
that encumbered 11 operating properties.

During 2007, the Company obtained individual construction
loans on five merchant building projects and assumed one loan in connection with
the acquisition of a merchant building project.  Additionally, the Company
repaid construction loans on three merchant building projects.  As of
December 31, 2007, the Company had a total of 15 construction loans with
commitments of up to $360.3 million of which approximately $245.9 million has
been funded. These loans had scheduled maturities ranging from one month to 33
months (excluding any extension options which may be available to the Company)
and bear interest at rates ranging from 6.78% to 7.48% at December 31, 2007.

During May 2006, the Company filed a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3ASR, which is effective for a term of three-years, for the
unlimited future offerings, from time-to-time, of debt securities, preferred
stock, depositary shares, common stock and common stock warrants.

During October 2007, the Company issued 18,400,000
Depositary Shares (the "Class G Depositary Shares"), after the exercise of an
over-allotment option, each representing a one-hundredth fractional interest in
a share of the Company’s 7.75% Class G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock,
par value $1.00 per share (the "Class G Preferred Stock").  Dividends on
the Class G Depositary Shares are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears at
the rate of 7.75% per annum based on the $25.00 per share initial offering
price, or $1.9375 per annum.  The Class G Depositary Shares are redeemable,
in whole or part, for cash on or after October 10, 2012, at the option of the
Company, at a redemption price of $25.00 per depositary share, plus any accrued
and unpaid dividends thereon.  The Class G Depositary Shares are not
convertible or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Company.
 Net proceeds from the sale of the Class G Depositary Shares, totaling
approximately $444.5 million (after related transaction costs of $15.5 million)
were used for general corporate purposes, including funding property
acquisitions, investments in the Company’s institutional management programs and
other investment activities.  The Company also used a portion of the
proceeds to partially repay amounts outstanding under its U.S. Credit
Facility.

During 2007, the Company received approximately $38.1
million through employee stock option exercises and the dividend reinvestment
program.

In connection with its intention to continue to qualify
as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue
paying regular dividends to its stockholders.  These dividends will be paid
from operating cash flows, which are expected to increase due to property
acquisitions, growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and


from other investments.
 Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital
investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend
payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion
and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the
acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable
opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers
appropriate.  Cash dividends paid increased to $384.5 million in 2007,
compared to $332.6 million in 2006 and $293.3 million in 2005.

Although the Company receives substantially all of its
rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying
dividends quarterly.  Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly
distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other
suitable instruments.  The Company’s Board of Directors declared a
quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share payable to shareholders of record
on January 2, 2008, which was paid on January 15, 2008.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

The Company has debt obligations relating to its
revolving credit facilities, MTNs, senior notes, mortgages and construction
loans with maturities ranging from less than one year to 28 years.  As of
December 31, 2007, the Company’s total debt had a weighted average term to
maturity of approximately 5.5 years.  In addition, the Company has
non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio.
 As of December 31, 2007, the Company has 79 shopping center properties
that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has
leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping
center.  In addition, the Company has 19 non-cancelable operating leases
pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio.  The following table
summarizes the Company’s debt maturities and obligations under non-cancelable
operating leases as of December 31, 2007 (in millions):

(1)

maturities utilized
do not reflect extension options, which range from six months to two years.

(2)

for loans which
have interest at floating rates, future interest expense was calculated using
the rate as of December 31, 2007.

The Company has $100.0 million of medium term notes,
$25.3 million of senior unsecured notes, $84.4 million of mortgage debt and
$260.9 million of construction loans scheduled to mature in 2008.  The
Company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating
cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facilities, new debt issuances and
the sale of completed ground-up development projects.

The Company has issued letters of credit in connection
with completion and repayment guarantees for construction loans encumbering
certain of the Company’s ground-up development projects and guaranty of payment
related to the Company’s insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate
approximately $30.7 million.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation
No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), which clarifies
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s
financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes".  The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute criteria for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
 The interpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition.

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January
1, 2007.  The Company does not have any material unrecognized tax benefits,
therefore the adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

During June 2007, the Company entered into a joint
venture, in which the Company has a non-controlling ownership interest, and
acquired all of the common stock of InTown Suites Management, Inc.  This
investment was funded with approximately $186.0 million of new


cross-collateralized
non-recourse mortgage debt with a fixed interest rate of 5.59%, encumbering 35
properties, a $153.0 million three-year unsecured credit facility, which bears
interest at LIBOR plus 0.325% and is guaranteed by the Company and the
assumption of $278.6 million cross-collateralized non-recourse mortgage debt
with fixed interest rates ranging from 5.19% to 5.89%, encumbering 86
properties. The joint venture partner has pledged its equity interest for any
guaranty payment the Company is obligated to pay.  The outstanding balance
on the three-year unsecured credit facility was $149.0 million as of December
31, 2007.  The joint venture obtained an interest rate swap at 5.37% on
$128.0 million of this debt.  The swap is designated as a cash flow hedge
and as such adjustments are recorded in Other comprehensive income.

During 2007, the Company entered into a joint venture, in
which the Company has a non-controlling ownership interest, to acquire a
property in Houston, Texas.  This investment was funded with a $24.5
million one-year unsecured credit facility with an additional one-year extension
option, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.375% and is guaranteed by the
Company. The outstanding balance on this credit facility as of December 31, 2007
was $24.5 million.

During April 2007, the Company entered into a joint
venture, in which the Company has a 50% non-controlling ownership interest to
acquire a property in Visalia, CA.  Subsequent to this acquisition the
joint venture obtained a three-year $6.0 million three-year promissory note
which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75%, and has an extension option of
two-years.  This loan is jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company
and the joint venture partner.  As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding
balance on this loan was $6.0 million.

The KimPru joint ventures, entities in which the Company
holds a 15% non-controlling interest, with Prudential Real Estate Investors
("PREI") through three separate accounts managed by PREI obtained a $1.2 billion
two-year credit facility provided by a consortium of banks and guaranteed by the
Company.  PREI guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any
guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make.  As of December 31,
2007, there was $702.5 million outstanding under this credit facility, which
bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.45% and is scheduled to mature in October
2008.

During 2006, an entity in which the Company has a
preferred equity investment, located in Montreal, Canada, obtained a
non-recourse construction loan, which is collateralized by the respective land
and project improvements. Additionally, the Company has provided a guaranty to
the lender and the developer partner has provided an indemnity to the Company
for 25% of all debt.  As of December 31, 2007, there was CAD $72.6 million
(approximately USD $74.0 million) outstanding on this construction loan.

In connection with the construction of its development
projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require performance
and surety bonds be posted to guarantee that the Company’s obligations are
satisfied.  These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and
infrastructure.  As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately $90.4
million bonds outstanding.

Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the
Company holds a 50% non-controlling interest, has a CAD $7.0 million
(approximately USD $7.1 million) letter of credit facility.  This facility
is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and had approximately CAD $5.5
million (approximately USD $5.6 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2007,
relating to various development projects.

During 2005, an entity in which the Company has a
preferred equity investment obtained a CAD $22.5 million (approximately USD
$22.9 million) credit facility to finance the construction of a 0.1 million
square foot shopping center property located in Kamloops, B.C.  This
facility bears interest at Royal Bank Prime Rate ("RBP") plus 0.5% per annum and
is scheduled to mature in March 2008.  The Company and its partner in this
entity each have a limited and several guarantee of CAD $7.5 million
(approximately USD $7.6 million) on this facility.  As of December 31,
2007, there was CAD $21.1 million (approximately USD $21.5 million) outstanding
on this facility.

During 2005, PL Retail, a joint venture in which the
Company holds a 15% non-controlling interest, entered into a $39.5 million
unsecured revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.45%
and was scheduled to mature in February 2008.  During 2008, the loan was
extended to February 2009.  This facility is guaranteed by the Company and
the joint venture partner has guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of
any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make.  As of December 31,
2007, there was $24.6 million outstanding under this facility.


Additionally, during 2005, the
Company acquired three operating properties and one land parcel, through joint
ventures, in which the Company holds 50% non-controlling interests. Subsequent
to these acquisitions, the joint ventures obtained four individual one-year
loans aggregating $20.4 million with interest rates ranging from LIBOR plus
0.50% to LIBOR plus 0.55%.  During 2007, one of these properties was sold
for a sales price of approximately $10.5 million, including the pay down of $5.0
million of debt.  During 2007, two of these term loans were extended until
May 2008 and one was extended until October 2008.  As of December 31, 2007,
there was an aggregate of $15.4 million outstanding on these loans.  These
loans are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture
partner.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Merchant Building Joint
Ventures

At December 31, 2007, the Company has two merchant
building projects through unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has
50% non-controlling interests.  One project is financed with a $113.0
million ten-year permanent note, which bears interest at a rate of 5.55% per
annum.  The other project is financed with a term loan, which is 50%
guaranteed by the Company, with a commitment of up to $28.0 million of which
$28.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2007.  This loan bears
interest at LIBOR plus 1.55%, or 6.78% at December 31, 2007, and is scheduled to
mature in September 2008.

Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint
Ventures

The Company has investments in various unconsolidated
real estate joint ventures with varying structures.  These joint ventures
operate either shopping center properties or are established for development
projects.  Such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional
investors, local developers and individuals. The properties owned by the joint
ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans.
 Non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the
lenders’ sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value
of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not
have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the
constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions
listed in the particular loan documents (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K).  These
investments include the following joint ventures:

(a) Ownership % is a blended rate.

(b) See Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
regarding guarantees by the Company and its joint venture partners.

(c) Represents the Company’s joint ventures with
Prudential Real Estate Investors.

(d) Represents the Kimco Income REIT, formed in 1998.

(e) Represents
the Company’s joint venture formed from the acquisition of the Price Legacy
Corporation.

(f) Represents
the Company’s joint ventures with UBS Wealth Management North American Property
Fund Limited.

(g) Represents the Company’s joint venture with RioCan
Real Estate Investment Trust.

The Company has various other unconsolidated real estate
joint ventures with varying structures.  As of December 31, 2007, these
unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non-recourse mortgage loans
aggregating approximately $2.9 billion.  The Company’s share of these
non-recourse mortgages was approximately $707.7 million.  (See Note 7 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on
Form 10-K.)


Other
Real Estate Investments

The Company maintains a Preferred Equity program, which
provides capital to developers and owners of real estate properties. The Company
accounts for its preferred equity investments under the equity method of
accounting.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company’s net investment under
the Preferred Equity Program was approximately $484.1 million relating to 258
properties. As of December 31, 2007, these preferred equity investment
properties had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately
$1.7 billion. Due to the Company’s preferred position in these investments, the
Company’s share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent
upon property cash flows. The Company’s maximum exposure to losses associated
with its preferred equity investments is primarily limited to its invested
capital.

Additionally, during July 2007, the Company
invested approximately $81.7 million of preferred equity capital in a portfolio
comprised of 403 net leased properties which are divided into 30 master leased
pools with each pool leased to individual corporate operators.  These
properties consist of a diverse array of free-standing restaurants, fast food
restaurants, convenience and auto parts stores.  As of December 31, 2007
these properties were encumbered by third party loans aggregating approximately
$433.0 million with interest rates ranging from 5.08% to 10.47% with a weighted
average interest rate of 9.3% and maturities ranging from 1.4 years to 15.2
years.

During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity
participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties.
 The properties are leased under a long-term bond-type net lease whose
primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option
rights.  The Company’s cash equity investment was approximately $4.0
million.  This equity investment is reported as a net investment in
leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as
amended).  The net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash
investment adjusted by remaining net rentals, estimated unguaranteed residual
value, unearned and deferred income and deferred taxes relating to the
investment.

As of December 31, 2007, 18 of these properties were
sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage
debt by approximately $32.1 million.  As of December 31, 2007, the
remaining 12 properties were encumbered by third-party non-recourse debt of
approximately $48.8 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the
primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable
under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the
Company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the
debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and
collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this debt has been offset
against the related net rental receivable under the lease.

Effects of Inflation

Many of the Company's leases contain provisions designed
to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.  Such provisions include
clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as
a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which
generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally
increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses
often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or
similar inflation indices.  In addition, many of the Company's leases are
for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase
rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Company's leases require the
tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area
maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the
Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from
inflation.  The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time-to-time,
enter into interest rate protection agreements and/or foreign currency hedge
agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in
interest rates on its floating-rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ("SFAS No. 157"),
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurement. This statement is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007.  During February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position that will (i)
partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and (ii) remove certain leasing
transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157.  The impact of adopting SFAS
No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.


In February 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities ("SFAS No. 159").  SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to
measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.
 Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has
been elected are reported in earnings.  SFAS No. 159 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.  The impact of SFAS No. 159
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

In June 2007, the AICPA issued Statement of Position
07-1, Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide for
Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method
Investors for Investments in Investment Companies (“SOP 07-1”).  SOP 07-1
sets forth more stringent criteria for qualifying as an investment company than
does the predecessor Audit Guide.  In addition, SOP 07-1 establishes new
criteria for a parent company or equity method investor to retain investment
company accounting in their consolidated financial statements. Investment
companies record all their investments at fair value with changes in value
reflected in earnings.  SOP 07-1 was to be effective for the Company’s 2008
fiscal year, however, in October 2007 the FASB agreed to propose an indefinite
delay, and, in February 2008, the FASB issued a final Staff Position to
indefinitely delay the effective date of SOP 07-1.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised
2007), Business Combinations ("SFAS No. 141(R)"). The objective of this
statement is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and
comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its
financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish
that, this Statement establishes principles and requirements for how the
acquirer: (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling
interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in
the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and (iii) determines
what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to
evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This
statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on
or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before that date.
 The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of SFAS No.
141(R) would have on the Company’s financial position and results of
operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of
ARB No. 51("SFAS No. 160"). A noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a
minority interest, is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable,
directly or indirectly, to a parent. The objective of this statement is to
improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial
information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial
statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards that require: (i)
the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be
clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated statement of
financial position within equity, but separate from the parent’s equity, (ii)
the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
non-controlling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the
consolidated statement of income, (iii) changes in a parent’s ownership interest
while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be
accounted for consistently and requires that they be accounted for similarly, as
equity transactions, (iv) when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained
noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured
at fair value, the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is
measured using the fair value of any noncontrolling equity investment rather
than the carrying amount of that retained investment and (v) entities provide
sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the
interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This
statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  Earlier adoption is
prohibited.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of
SFAS No. 160 would have on the Company’s financial position and results of
operations.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company’s primary market risk exposure is interest
rate risk.  The following table presents the Company’s aggregate fixed rate
and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of
December 31, 2007, with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by
maturity date.  The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents,
which is the Company’s reporting currency.  The instruments’ actual cash
flows are denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos as
indicated by geographic description ($USD equivalent in millions).


Based on the Company’s variable-rate debt balances,
interest expense would have increased by approximately $6.8 million in 2007 if
short-term interest rates were 1.0% higher.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had (i) Canadian
investments totaling CAD $476.8 million (approximately USD $482.5 million)
comprised of real estate joint venture investments and marketable securities,
(ii) Mexican real estate investments of approximately MXP 8.0 billion
(approximately USD $734.8 million) and (iii) Chilean real estate investments of
approximately 1.6 billion Chilean Pesos ("CLP") (approximately USD $3.0
million).  The foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated
through the use of local currency denominated debt.  The Company has not,
and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
no other material exposure to market risk.

financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the

that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December
31, 2007.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report

Item 9B. Other
Information

Amendments
to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.

On February 27, 2008, the
Company's Board of Directors amended and restated the Company's bylaws,
effective upon adoption.  The full text of the Company's amended and
restated bylaws is set forth in Exhibit 3.2 to this 10-K and is incorporated
into this Item 9B by reference.  The following summarizes these
amendments.

Voting Requirements for Election of Directors

·

Previously,
the bylaws provided that a plurality vote was sufficient to elect directors.
 As amended, Article II, Section 5 of the bylaws provides that, except in
an election in which the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of
directors to be elected, each director must be elected by a majority of the
votes cast in person or by proxy at any meeting that includes the election of
directors and at which a quorum is present.

·

For purposes
of the election of directors, a majority of the votes cast means the affirmative
vote of a majority of the total votes cast “for” and “against” such nominee.
 Votes cast do not include “abstentions” and any “broker non-votes.”

·

In an election in which the number of
nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected, directors
will continue to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast.

Director Resignations

·

If an incumbent director fails to
receive the requisite vote in an election, the bylaws require (1) the director
to offer to resign from the Board, (2) the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Board to make a recommendation to the Board as to whether the
Board should accept the resignation and (3) the Board to consider the
recommendation of the Committee and to publicly disclose its decision regarding
the resignation, and the reasons for its decision within 90 days after the date
on which the results of the election were certified.


·

The Committee, in making its
recommendation, and the Board, in making its decision, may each consider any
factors or other information that it considers to be relevant.  The
director whose resignation is being considered may not participate in the
recommendation of the Committee or the decision of the Board, except in the
event that no nominee for director receives the vote required in the bylaws for
election.

·

If an incumbent director's
resignation is not accepted by the Board, the director will continue to serve
until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until his or her successor
is duly elected and qualifies, or his or her earlier death, resignation,
retirement or removal.

·

If a director's resignation is
accepted by the Board, or if a non-incumbent nominee for director is not
elected, the Board may fill any resulting vacancy in accordance with the
bylaws.

Advance Notice Provisions

generally provide that such advance notice shall be delivered to the Secretary
at the principal executive office of the Company not earlier than the 150th day
nor later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 120th day prior to the first

Eastern Time, on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the
tenth day following the first public announcement of the date of the special
meeting.

·

Additionally,
the amended bylaws require certain information to be provided by the stockholder
making a nomination or proposal, including information about the nominee or

Item 10.  Directors and
Executive Officers of the Registrant

Incorporated herein by reference to
the Company's definitive proxy statement to be filed with respect to its Annual
Meeting of Stockholders expected to be held on May 13, 2008.

Information with respect to the
Executive Officers of the Registrant follows Part I, Item 4 of this annual

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES


REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Kimco Realty Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Kimco Realty Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(2)

present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements.  Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is
responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies:

Business

Kimco Realty
Corporation (the "Company" or "Kimco"), its subsidiaries, affiliates and related
real estate joint ventures are engaged principally in the operation of
neighborhood and community shopping centers which are anchored generally by
discount department stores, supermarkets or drugstores.  The Company also
provides property management services for shopping centers owned by affiliated
entities, various real estate joint ventures and unaffiliated third parties.

Additionally, in
connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became
effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in activities
which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as
a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are
conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), subject to certain
limitations.  As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries,
is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including (i)
merchant building through it’s wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries including
Kimco Developers, Inc. ("KDI"), which are primarily engaged in the ground-up
development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent
sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition
services which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail
real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and/or bankrupt retailers
and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred
exchange transactions.

The Company seeks
to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by
the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single
property, and a large tenant base.  At December 31, 2007, the Company's
single largest neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for only
1.7% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues and only 0.8% of the
Company’s total shopping center gross leasable area ("GLA").  At December
31, 2007, the Company’s five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies,
Sears Holdings, Kohl’s and Wal-Mart, which represented approximately 3.2%, 2.8%,
2.3%, 2.0% and 1.9%, respectively, of the Company’s annualized base rental
revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from
properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest.

The principal
business of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is the ownership,
development, management and operation of retail shopping centers, including
complementary services that capitalize on the Company’s established retail real
estate expertise.  The Company does not distinguish its principal business
or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring
performance.  Accordingly, the Company believes it has a single reportable
segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

Principles of Consolidation and
Estimates

The accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its
subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned, and all entities in which the
Company has a controlling interest, including where the Company has been
determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in
accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46(R),
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46(R)") or meets certain
criteria of a sole general partner or managing member as identified in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investor’s
Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the
Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5").
 All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.


KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
continued

GAAP requires the
Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting
period.  The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the
valuation of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities,
depreciable lives, revenue recognition, the collectability of trade accounts
receivable, and the realizability of deferred tax assets.  Application of
these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties,
and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.

Minority
Interests

Minority
interests represent the portion of equity that the Company does not own in those
entities it consolidates as a result of having a controlling interest or
determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of FIN 46(R).

Minority
interests also include partnership units issued from consolidated subsidiaries
of the Company in connection with certain property acquisitions.  These
units have a stated redemption value or a redemption amount based upon the
Adjusted Current Trading Price, as defined, of the Company’s common stock
("Common Stock") and provide the unit holders various rates of return during the
holding period.  The unit holders generally have the right to redeem their
units for cash at any time after one year from issuance.  The Company
typically has the option to settle redemption amounts in cash or Common Stock
for the issuance of convertible units.  The Company evaluates the terms of
the partnership units issued in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, and EITF D-98,
Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, to determine if the
units are mandatorily redeemable and as such accounts for them accordingly.

Real Estate

Real estate
assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. If
there is an event or a change in circumstances that indicates that the basis of
a property (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities)
may not be recoverable, then management will assess any impairment in value by
making a comparison of (i) the current and projected operating cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its estimated
holding period, and (ii) the net carrying amount of the property.  If the
current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) are less than the carrying value of the property, the carrying value
would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the
property.

When a real
estate asset is identified by management as held for sale, the Company ceases
depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs.
If, in management’s opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the
net book value of the asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be
recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.

Upon acquisition
of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of
acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements
and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities
(consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant
relationships), assumed debt and redeemable units issued in accordance with SFAS
No. 141, Business Combinations ("SFAS No. 141"), at the date of acquisition,
based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Based
on these estimates, the Company allocates the initial purchase price to the
applicable assets and liabilities. As final information regarding fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are
refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation.
 The allocations are finalized within twelve months of the acquisition
date.

The Company
utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating
the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities.  The fair value of the
tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property
"as-if-vacant".  The fair value reflects the depreciated replacement cost
of the permanent assets, with no trade fixtures included.


KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
continued

In allocating the
purchase price to identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired
property, the value of above-market and below-market leases is estimated based
on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be
paid pursuant to the leases and management’s estimate of the market lease rates
and other lease provisions (i.e., expense recapture, base rental changes, etc.)
measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease.
 The capitalized above-market or below-market intangible is amortized to
rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases.
 Mortgage debt premiums are amortized into interest expense over the
remaining term of the related debt instrument.  Unit discounts and premiums
are amortized into Minority interest in income, net over the period from the
date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the units.

In determining
the value of in-place leases, management considers current market conditions and
costs to execute similar leases in arriving at an estimate of the carrying costs
during the expected lease-up period from vacant to existing occupancy. In
estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance,
other operating expenses, and estimates of lost rental revenue during the
expected lease-up periods and costs to execute similar leases including leasing
commissions, legal and other related costs based on current market demand.
 In estimating the value of tenant relationships, management considers the
nature and extent of the existing tenant relationship, the expectation of lease
renewals, growth prospects, and tenant credit quality, among other factors.
 The value assigned to in-place leases and tenant relationships is
amortized over the estimated remaining term of the leases.  If a lease were
to be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration, all unamortized costs
relating to that lease would be written off.

Depreciation and
amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, as follows:

Buildings and
building improvements

15 to 50 years

Fixtures,
leasehold and tenant improvements

Terms of leases or useful lives,
whichever is shorter

(including certain identified
intangible assets)

Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  Significant
renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset,
are capitalized.  The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are
evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being
accounted for over the revised remaining useful life.

Real Estate Under
Development

Real estate under
development represents both the ground-up development of neighborhood and
community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion
and projects which the Company may hold as long-term investments.  These
properties are carried at cost.  The cost of land and buildings under
development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs
include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property,
development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes,
salaries, and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs
incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost
capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon
substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from
the completion of major construction activity.  If, in management’s
opinion, the net sales price of assets held for resale or the current and
projected undiscounted cash flows of these assets to be held as long-term
investments is less than the net carrying value, the carrying value would be
adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint
Ventures

The Company
accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity
method of accounting as the Company exercises significant influence, but does
not control these entities.  These investments are recorded initially at
cost and subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions.
 Earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each
respective investment agreement and where applicable, based upon an allocation
of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was
hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period.


KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
continued

The Company’s
joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of
co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in
neighborhood and community shopping center properties, consistent with its core
business.  These joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third-party
financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the
Company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment; and due to
the lender’s exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level
of equity in order to mitigate its risk.  The Company’s exposure to losses
associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its
carrying value in these investments.

On a periodic
basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of
the Company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An
investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value
of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such
difference is deemed to be other than temporary.  To the extent impairment
has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of
the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment.

Other Real Estate
Investments

Other real estate
investments primarily consist of preferred equity investments for which the
Company provides capital to developers and owners of real estate.  The
Company typically accounts for its preferred equity investments on the equity
method of accounting, whereby earnings for each investment are recognized in
accordance with each respective investment agreement and based upon an
allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was
hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period.

Mortgages and
Other Financing Receivables

Mortgages and
other financing receivables consist of loans acquired and loans originated by
the Company.  Loan receivables are recorded at stated principal amounts net
of any discount or premium or deferred loan origination costs or fees.  The
related discounts or premiums on mortgages and other loans purchased are
amortized or accreted over the life of the related loan receivable.  The
Company defers certain loan origination and commitment fees, net of certain
origination costs and amortizes them as an adjustment of the loan’s yield over
the term of the related loan.  The Company evaluates the collectability of
both interest and principal on each loan to determine whether it is impaired.
 A loan is considered to be impaired, when based upon current information
and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all
amounts due according to the existing contractual terms.  When a loan is
considered to be impaired, the amount of loss is calculated by comparing the
recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future
cash flows at the loan’s effective interest rate or to the value of the
underlying collateral if the loan is collateralized.  Interest income on
performing loans is accrued as earned.  Interest income on impaired loans
is recognized on a cash basis.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash
equivalents (demand deposits in banks, commercial paper and certificates of
deposit with original maturities of three months or less) includes tenants'
security deposits, escrowed funds and other restricted deposits approximating
$0.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Cash and cash
equivalent balances may, at a limited number of banks and financial
institutions, exceed insurable amounts.  The Company believes it mitigates
risk by investing in or through major financial institutions.
 Recoverability of investments is dependent upon the performance of the
issuers.

Marketable Securities

The Company
classifies its existing marketable equity securities as available-for-sale in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.  These securities are carried at
fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’
equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI"). Gains
or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification
method.


KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
continued

All debt
securities are classified as held-to-maturity because the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
 Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost, adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.

On a periodic
basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of
the Company’s marketable securities may be impaired.  A marketable security
is impaired only if management’s estimate of fair value of the security is less
than the carrying value of the security and such difference is deemed to be
other than temporary.  To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss
shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the security over the
estimated fair value in the security.

Deferred Leasing and Financing
Costs

Costs incurred in
obtaining tenant leases and long-term financing, included in deferred charges
and prepaid expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, are
amortized over the terms of the related leases or debt agreements, as
applicable.  Such capitalized costs include salaries and related costs of
personnel directly involved in successful leasing efforts.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts
Receivable

Base rental
revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of the related leases.  Certain of these leases also provide for
percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee.
 These percentage rents are recognized once the required sales level is
achieved.  Rental income may also include payments received in connection
with lease termination agreements.  In addition, leases typically provide
for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance costs, real estate
taxes and other operating expenses.  Operating expense reimbursements are
recognized as earned.

Management and
other fee income consists of property management fees, leasing fees, property
acquisition and disposition fees, development fees and asset management fees.
These fees arise from contractual agreements with third parties or with entities
in which the Company has a partial non-controlling interest.  Management
and other fee income, including acquisition and disposition fees, are recognized
as earned under the respective agreements.  Management and other fee income
related to partially owned entities are recognized to the extent attributable to
the unaffiliated interest.

Gains and losses
from the sale of depreciated operating property and ground-up development
projects are generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance
with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate ("SFAS No. 66"), provided
that various criteria relating to the terms of sale and subsequent involvement
by the Company with the properties are met.

Gains and losses
on transfers of operating properties result from the sale of a partial interest
in properties to unconsolidated joint ventures and are recognized using the
partial sale provisions of SFAS No. 66.

The Company makes
estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base
rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues.  The Company analyzes
accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit worthiness
and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts.  In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and
estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and
post-petition claims.  The Company’s reported net income is directly
affected by management’s estimate of the collectability of accounts
receivable.

Income Taxes

The Company has
made an election to qualify, and believes it is operating so as to qualify, as a
REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company generally will
not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its
stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income as defined
under Section 856 through 860 of the Code.


KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
continued

In connection
with the RMA, which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted
to participate in certain activities which it was previously precluded from in
order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, so long as these activities are
conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under
the Code.  As such, the Company is subject to federal and state income
taxes on the income from these activities.

Income taxes are
accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carry-forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The Company
provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not
consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.

Foreign Currency Translation and
Transactions

Assets and
liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated using year-end
exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates as
determined throughout the year.  Gains or losses resulting from translation
are included in OCI, as a separate component of the Company’s stockholders’
equity.  Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of
the transactions.  The effect of the transaction’s gain or loss is included
in the caption Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivative/Financial
Instruments

The Company
measures its derivative instruments at fair value and records them in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset or liability, depending on the Company’s
rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract.  In
addition, the fair value adjustments will be recorded in either stockholders’
equity or earnings in the current period based on the designation of the
derivative.  The effective portions of changes in fair value of cash flow
hedges are reported in OCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when
the hedged item affects earnings.  Changes in the fair value of foreign
currency hedges that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are
included in the cumulative translation component of OCI to the extent they are
economically effective and are subsequently reclassified to earnings when the
hedged investments are sold or otherwise disposed of.  The changes in fair
value of derivative instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments
and the ineffective portions of hedges are recorded in earnings for the current
period.

The Company
utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market fluctuations on
equity securities.  The Company has established policies and procedures for
risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative
financial instrument activities.  The Company has not entered, and does not
plan to enter, into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
 Additionally, the Company has a policy of only entering into derivative
contracts with major financial institutions.  The principal financial
instruments used by the Company are interest rate swaps, foreign currency
exchange forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and warrant contracts.
 These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow,
fair value or foreign currency hedges (see Note 16).

Earnings Per Share

On July 21, 2005,
the Company’s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split (the "Stock
Split") of the Company’s common stock which was effected in the form of a stock
dividend paid on August 23, 2005, to stockholders of record on August 8, 2005.
 All share and per share data included in the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been adjusted to reflect this Stock
Split.

The
effect of the assumed conversion of certain convertible units had an
anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of Income from continuing operations
before extraordinary gain per share.  Accordingly, the impact of such
conversions has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per

In addition,
there were approximately 3,017,400, 71,250, and 2,195,400 stock options that
were anti-dilutive as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Stock Compensation

The Company
maintains an equity participation plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which a maximum
of 42,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued for qualified and
non-qualified options and restricted stock grants.  Options granted under
the Plan generally vest ratably over a three year term for options granted prior
to August 1, 2005 or five year term for options granted after August 1, 2005,
expire ten years from the date of grant and are exercisable at the market price
on the date of grant, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors at
its sole discretion.  Restricted stock grants generally vest 100% on the
fifth anniversary of the grant.  In addition, the Plan provides for the
granting of certain options to each of the Company’s non-employee directors (the
"Independent Directors") and permits such Independent Directors to elect to
receive deferred stock awards in lieu of directors’ fees.

Prior to January
1, 2003, the Company accounted for the Plan under the intrinsic value-based
method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations
including FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions
involving Stock Compensation (an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25).
 Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the prospective method
provisions of SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition
and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 ("SFAS No. 148"), which
applies the recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS No. 123") to all employee awards granted,
modified or settled after January 1, 2003.

During December
2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS
No. 123(R)"), which is a revision of Statement 123. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes
Opinion 25.  Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the
approach described in Statement 123.  However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options,
to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values.
 Pro-forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R).
 SFAS No. 123(R) was effective for fiscal years beginning after December
31, 2005.  The Company began expensing stock based employee compensation
with its adoption of the prospective method provisions of SFAS No. 148,
effective January 1, 2003, as a result, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not
have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
operations.

The non-cash
expense related to stock-based employee compensation included in the
determination of net income is less than that which would have been recognized
if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original
effective date of SFAS No. 123.  There was no difference in amounts for the
years ended December 31, 2007 or 2006.  The following table illustrates the
effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value based method had
been applied to all outstanding stock awards in 2005 (amounts presented in
thousands, except per share data):

The pro forma
adjustments to net income and net income per diluted common share assume fair
value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing formula.  The more significant assumptions
underlying the determination of such fair values for options granted during the
year ended December 2005 were as follows:

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In September
2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ("SFAS No. 157"),
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurement.  This statement is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007.  During February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position
that will (i) partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for one year
for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and (ii) remove
certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157.  The impact of
adopting SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

In February 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities ("SFAS No. 159").  SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.
 Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has
been elected are reported in earnings.  SFAS No. 159 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.  The impact of adopting
SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

In June 2007, the
AICPA issued Statement of Position 07-1, Clarification of the Scope of the Audit
and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies
and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies ("SOP
07-1").  SOP 07-1 sets forth more stringent criteria for qualifying as an
investment company than does the predecessor Audit Guide.  In addition, SOP
07-1 establishes new criteria for a parent company or equity method investor to
retain investment company accounting in their consolidated financial statements.
 Investment companies record all their investments at fair value with
changes in value reflected in earnings.  SOP 07-1 was to be effective for
the Company’s 2008 fiscal year, however, in October 2007 the FASB agreed to
propose an indefinite delay and in February 2008, the FASB issued a final Staff
Position to indefinitely delay the effective date of SOP 07-1.

In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ("SFAS No.
141(R)").  The objective of this statement is to improve the relevance,
representation, faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a
reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination
and its effects. To accomplish that, this Statement establishes principles and
requirements for how the acquirer: (i) recognizes and measures in its financial
statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the
goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase
and (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the
financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the
business combination.  This statement applies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual
reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  An entity may
not apply it before that date.  The Company is currently assessing the
impact the adoption of SFAS No 141(R) would have on the Company’s financial
position and results of operations.

In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non-Controlling Interest in Consolidated Financial
Statements in Amendment of ARB No. 51 ("SFAS No. 160").  A non-controlling
interest, sometimes called a minority interest, is the portion of equity in a
subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.  The
objective of this statement is to improve the relevance, comparability, and
transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in
its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting
standards that require: (i) the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by
parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in
the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate
from the parent’s equity, (ii) the amount of consolidated net income
attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest be clearly
identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income,
(iii) changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its
controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently
and requires that they be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions, (iv)
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity
investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value, the
gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair
value of any non-controlling equity investment rather than the carrying amount
of that retained investment, and (v) entities provide sufficient disclosures
that clearly identity and distinguish between the interest of the parent and the
interest of the non-controlling owners.  This statement is effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or
after December 15, 2008.  Earlier adoption is prohibited.  The Company
is currently assessing the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 would have on the
Company’s financial position and results of operations.

Kimsouth -

During November
2002, the Company through its taxable REIT subsidiary, together with Prometheus
Southeast Retail Trust, completed the merger and privatization of Konover
Property Trust, which has been renamed Kimsouth Realty, Inc. ("Kimsouth").
 In connection with the merger, the Company acquired 44.5% of the common
stock of Kimsouth, which consisted primarily of 38 retail shopping center
properties comprising approximately 4.6 million square feet of GLA.  Total
acquisition value was approximately $280.9 million including approximately
$216.2 million in mortgage debt. The Company’s investment strategy with respect
to Kimsouth included re-tenanting, repositioning and disposition of the
properties. As of January 1, 2006, Kimsouth consisted of five properties.

During 2006,
Kimsouth sold two properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $9.8
million and transferred two properties to a joint venture in which the Company
has an 18% non-controlling interest for an aggregate price of approximately
$54.0 million, which included the repayment of approximately $23.1 million in
mortgage debt.

During May 2006,
the Company acquired an additional 48% interest in Kimsouth for approximately
$22.9 million, which increased the Company’s total ownership to 92.5%. As a
result of this transaction, the Company became the controlling shareholder and
had therefore, commenced consolidation of Kimsouth upon the closing date.
 The acquisition of the additional 48% ownership interest has been
accounted for as a step acquisition with the purchase price being allocated to
the identified assets and liabilities of Kimsouth.

As of May 2006,
Kimsouth had approximately $133.0 million of net operating loss carry-forwards
("NOLs"), which may be utilized to offset future taxable income of Kimsouth. The
Company evaluated the need for a valuation allowance based on projected taxable
income and determined that a valuation allowance of approximately $34.2 million
was required.  As such, a purchase price adjustment of $17.5 million was
recorded (See Note 22 for additional information).

During June 2006,
Kimsouth contributed approximately $51.0 million, of which $47.2 million or
92.5% was provided by the Company, to fund its 15% non-controlling interest in a
newly formed joint venture with an investment group to acquire a portion of
Albertson’s Inc.  To maximize investment returns, the investment group’s
strategy with respect to this joint venture, includes refinancing, selling
selected stores and the enhancement of operations at the remaining stores.
 Kimsouth accounts for this investment under the equity method of
accounting.  During the year ended December 31, 2007, this joint venture
completed the disposition of certain operating stores and a refinancing of the
remaining assets in the joint venture.  As a result of these transactions
Kimsouth received cash distributions of approximately $148.6 million.
 Kimsouth has a remaining capital commitment obligation to fund up to an
additional $15.0 million for general purposes.  Due to this remaining
capital commitment, $15.0 million is included in Other liabilities in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

During the year
ended December 31, 2007, Kimsouth’s income from the Albertson’s joint venture
aggregated approximately $49.6 million, net of income tax.  This amount
includes (i) an operating loss of approximately $15.1 million, net of an income
tax benefit of approximately $10.1 million, (ii) distribution in excess of
Kimsouth’s investment of approximately $10.4 million, net of income tax expense
of approximately $6.9 million, and (iii) an extraordinary gain of approximately
$54.3 million, net of income tax expense of approximately $36.2 million,
resulting from purchase price allocation adjustments as determined in accordance
with SFAS No. 141. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion 18,
The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, the Company has
classified its 15% share of the extraordinary gain, net of income taxes, as a
separate component on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.


KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
continued

During 2007,
Kimsouth sold its remaining property for an aggregate sales price of
approximately $9.1 million.  This sale resulted in a gain of approximately
$7.9 million, net of income taxes.

As a result of
the Albertson’s transaction and the property sale described above, the Company
has reduced the valuation allowance that was applied against the Kimsouth NOLs
resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $31.2 million.  At
December 31, 2007, Kimsouth has deferred tax assets of approximately $14.8
million representing the tax effect of approximately $37.9 million of NOLs that
expire from 2021 to 2023. The Company believes that it is more likely than not
that a net deferred tax asset of approximately $11.7 million will be realized on
future tax returns, primarily from the generation of future taxable income and
therefore, a valuation allowance of $3.1 million has been established for a
portion of these deferred tax assets.

During 2007, the
Albertson’s joint venture acquired two operating properties for approximately
$20.3 million, including the assumption of $18.5 million in non-recourse
mortgage debt.

During
July 2006, Kimsouth contributed approximately $3.7 million to fund its 15%
non-controlling interest in a newly formed joint venture with an investment
group to acquire 50 grocery anchored operating properties.  During
September 2006, Kimsouth contributed an additional $2.2 million to this joint
venture to acquire an operating property in Sacramento, CA, comprising
approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA, for a purchase price of
approximately $14.5 million.  This joint venture investment is included in
Investment and advances in real estate joint ventures in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Dispositions of Real Estate:

Operating Real
Estate -

During 2007, the
Company (i) disposed of six operating properties and completed partial sales of
three operating properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales
price of approximately $40.0 million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of
approximately $6.4 million, after income tax of approximately $1.6 million, and
(ii) transferred one operating property, which was acquired in the first quarter
of 2007, to a joint venture in which the Company holds a 15% non-controlling
ownership interest for an aggregate price of approximately $4.5 million, which

During 2007, FNC
Realty Corporation, a consolidated entity in which the Company holds a 53%
controlling ownership interest, disposed of, in separate transactions, seven

investments in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

Additionally,
during 2007, two consolidated joint ventures in which the Company had preferred
equity investments disposed of, in separate transactions, their respective
properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $66.5 million.  As
a result of these capital transactions, the Company received approximately $22.1
million of profit participation, before minority interest of approximately $5.6
million.  This profit participation has been recorded as income from other
real estate investments and is reflected in Income from discontinued operating
properties in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

During 2006, the
Company disposed of (i) 28 operating properties and one ground lease for an
aggregate sales price of approximately $270.5 million, which resulted in an

million relating to the sale of two properties, and (ii) transferred five
operating properties, to joint ventures in which the Company has 20%
non-controlling interests for an aggregate price of approximately $95.4 million,
which resulted in a gain of approximately $1.4 million from one transferred
property.

During November
2006, the Company disposed of a vacant land parcel located in Bel Air, MD, for
approximately $1.8 million resulting in a $1.6 million gain on sale.  This
gain is included in Other income (expense), net on the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Income.

of approximately $31.9 million and a loss on sale/transfer from four of the
properties of approximately $5.2 million.

During June 2005,
the Company disposed of a vacant land parcel located in New Ridge, MD, for
approximately $5.6 million resulting in a $4.6 million gain on sale.  This
gain is included in Other income (expense), net on the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Merchant Building

During 2007, the
Company sold, in separate transactions, (i) four of its recently completed
merchant building projects, (ii) 26 out-parcels, (iii) 74.3 acres of undeveloped
land, and (iv) completed partial sales of two projects, for an aggregate total
proceeds of approximately $310.5 million and received approximately $3.3 million
of proceeds from completed earn-out requirements on previously sold projects.
 These sales resulted in pre-tax gains of approximately $40.1 million.

During 2006, the
Company sold, in separate transactions, six of its recently completed projects,
its partnership interest in one project and 30 out-parcels for approximately
$260.0 million.  These sales resulted in pre-tax gains of approximately
$37.3 million.

During 2005, the
Company sold, in separate transactions, six of its recently completed projects
and 41 out-parcels for approximately $264.1 million.  These sales resulted
in pre-tax gains of approximately $33.6 million.

5.

Adjustment of Property Carrying Values:

As part of the
Company’s ongoing analysis of its merchant building projects, the Company has
determined that for two of its projects, located in Jacksonville, FL and
Anchorage, AK, the recoverable value will not exceed their estimated cost.
 This is primarily due to adverse changes in local market conditions and

During 2007, the
Company classified as held-for-sale ten shopping center properties comprising
approximately 0.6 million square feet of GLA.  The book value of each of
these properties, aggregating approximately $80.7 million, net of accumulated
depreciation of approximately $4.9 million, did not exceed each of their
estimated fair values.  As a result, no adjustment of property carrying
value has been recorded. The Company’s determination of the fair value for each
of these properties, aggregating approximately $116.8 million, is based
primarily upon executed contracts of sale with third parties less estimated
selling costs.  During 2007, the Company completed the sale of five of
these properties and reclassified one property as held-for-use.

During 2006, the
Company reclassified as held-for-sale 13 operating properties comprising 0.8
million square feet of GLA.  The aggregate book value of these properties
was approximately $36.5 million, net of accumulated depreciation of
approximately $5.9 million.  The book value of one property exceeded its
estimated fair value by approximately $0.6 million, and, as a result, the
Company recorded a loss resulting from an adjustment of property carrying value
of approximately $0.6 million.  The remaining properties had fair values
exceeding their book values, and, as a result, no adjustment of property
carrying value was recorded.  The Company’s determination of the fair value
for each of these properties, aggregating approximately $50.0 million, is based
primarily upon executed contracts of sale with third parties less estimated
selling costs.  The Company completed the sale of these operating
properties during 2006 and 2007.

During 2005, the
Company reclassified as held-for-sale four operating properties comprising
approximately 0.6 million square feet of GLA.  The book value of each of

estimated fair values.  As a result, no adjustment of property carrying
value was recorded.  The Company’s determination of the fair value for each
of these properties, aggregating approximately $61.4 million, was based upon
executed contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs.

Leveraged Lease -

During June 2002,
the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing
leveraged lease of 30 properties.  The properties are leased under a
long-term bond-type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the
lessee having certain renewal option rights.  The Company’s cash equity
investment was approximately $4.0 million.  This equity investment is
reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13,
Accounting for Leases (as amended).

From 2002 to
2006, 16 of these properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were
used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $28.3 million.

During 2007, an
additional two properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were
used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $3.0 million.  As of
December 31, 2007, the remaining 12 properties were encumbered by third-party
non-recourse debt of approximately $48.8 million that is scheduled to fully
amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net
rents receivable under the net lease.

As an equity
participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no recourse obligation for
principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first
mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease.
 Accordingly, this obligation has been offset against the related net
rental receivable under the lease.

At December 31,
2007 and 2006, the Company’s net investment in the leveraged lease consisted of
the following (in millions):

Marketable Securities:

The amortized
cost and estimated fair values of securities available-for-sale and
held-to-maturity at December 31, 2007 and 2006, are as follows (in
thousands):

For each of the
securities in the Company's portfolio with unrealized losses, the Company
reviews the underlying cause of the decline in value and the estimated recovery
period, as well as the severity and duration of the decline. In the Company's
evaluation, the Company considers its ability and intent to hold these
investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the Company to
recover its cost basis. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate unrealized loss of
$18.0 million relates to marketable securities with an aggregate fair value of
$83.3 million. The Company does not believe that the decline in value of any of
these securities is other-than-temporary at December 31,2007.

As of December
31, 2007, the contractual maturities of Other debt securities classified as
held-to-maturity are as follows:  within one year, $1.4 million; after one
year through five years, $39.2 million; after five years through 10 years, $28.9
million; and after 10 years, $17.5 million.  Actual maturities may differ
from contractual maturities as issuers may have the right to prepay debt
obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

Fair Value Disclosure of Financial
Instruments:

All financial
instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets at amounts which, in management’s estimation based upon an
interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies,
reasonably approximate their fair values except those listed below, for which
fair values are reflected.  The valuation method used to estimate fair
value for fixed-rate debt and minority interests relating to mandatorily
redeemable non-controlling interests associated with finite-lived subsidiaries
of the Company is based on discounted cash flow analyses.  The fair values
for marketable securities are based on published or securities dealers’
estimated market values.  Such fair value estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition.  The
following are financial instruments for which the Company’s estimate of fair
value differs from the carrying amounts (in thousands):

Financial Instruments - Derivatives and
Hedging:

The Company is
exposed to the effect of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations and market value fluctuations of equity securities. The
Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and
procedures including the use of derivatives.


KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

The principal
financial instruments generally used by the Company are interest rate swaps,
foreign currency exchange forward contracts, cross currency swaps and equity
warrant contracts. The Company, from time to time, hedges the future cash flows
of its floating-rate debt instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate risk
principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions.

During 2007, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $18.75
million (which commenced on May 15, 2007).  The interest rate swap is
designated as a cash flow hedge and is hedging the variability of floating rate
interest payments on the debt of a consolidated subsidiary.  No hedge
ineffectiveness on this cash flow hedge was recognized during 2007.  For
the year ended December 31, 2007, the change in net unrealized gains/losses on
this hedge was reported in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity
as a $0.2 million net loss.  Amounts reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest
expense as interest payments are made on the variable-rate debt. The change in
net unrealized gains/losses on cash flow hedges reflects a reclassification of
$28,000 of net unrealized gains from accumulated other comprehensive income to
reduce interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007.

As of December
31, 2006, the Company had two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $21.5
million and $6.25 million outstanding that were designated as cash flow hedges.
During 2007, these swaps were early terminated for a gain of $0.1 million.
  For the year ending December 31, 2007 and 2006, the change in net
unrealized gains/losses on these hedges was reported in the consolidated
statements of stockholders’ equity as a $0.3 million (net gain) and $0.1 million
(net loss), respectively.  The change in net unrealized gains/losses on
cash flow hedges reflects a reclassification of $21,000 of net unrealized gains
from accumulated other comprehensive income to reduce interest expense for the
year ended December 31, 2007.

As of December
31, 2006, the Company had a cross currency interest rate swap with an aggregate
notional amount of approximately MXP 82.4 million (approximately USD $7.6
million) designated as a hedge of its Mexican real estate investments.
 This cross currency interest rate swap matured during October 2007.
 Additionally, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts
designated as net investment hedges of its Canadian investments in real estate
that the Company settled during 2006. These agreements were highly effective in
reducing the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. As such, gains and
losses on these net investment hedges were reported in the same manner as a
translation adjustment in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency
Translation.  During 2007 and 2006, respectively, $0.0 million and $0.2
million of unrealized losses and $0.3 million and $0.3 million of
unrealized gains were included in the cumulative translation adjustment relating
to the Company’s net investment hedges of its Mexican and Canadian
investments.

The following
tables summarize the notional values and fair values of the Company's derivative
financial instruments as of December 31, 2007 and 2006:

including funding property acquisitions, investments in the Company’s
institutional management programs and other investment activities.  The
Company also used a portion of the proceeds to partially repay amounts
outstanding under its U.S. Credit Facility.  The Class G Preferred Stock

Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Class F Preferred Stock").
 Dividends on the Class F Depositary Shares are cumulative and payable
quarterly in arrears at the rate of 6.65% per annum based on the $25.00 per

Shares are redeemable, in whole or part, for cash on or after June 5, 2008, at
the option of the Company, at a redemption price of $25.00 per Depositary Share,
plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon.  The Class F Depositary
Shares are not convertible or exchangeable for any other property or securities
of the Company. The Class F Preferred Stock (represented by the Class F
Depositary Shares outstanding) ranks pari passu with the Company’s Class G
Preferred Stock as to voting rights, priority for receiving dividends and

Preferred Stock). As a result, each Class F Depositary Share is entitled to one
vote.

plus an amount
equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of payment, before any

other capital stock that ranks junior to the Preferred Stock as to liquidation
rights.

During March
2006, the Company completed a primary public stock offering of 10,000,000 shares
of the Company’s common stock.  The net proceeds from this sale of Common
Stock, totaling approximately $405.5 million (after related transaction costs of
$2.5 million) were primarily used to repay the outstanding balance under the
Company’s U.S. revolving credit facility, partial repayment of the outstanding
balance under the Company’s Canadian denominated credit facility and for general
corporate purposes.

During March
2006, the shareholders of Atlantic Realty Trust ("Atlantic Realty") approved the
proposed merger with the Company and the closing occurred on March 31, 2006.
 As consideration for this transaction, the Company issued Atlantic Realty
shareholders 1,274,420 shares of Common Stock, excluding 748,510 shares of
Common Stock that were to be received by the Company, at a price of $40.41 per
share.

On September 25,
2006, Pan Pacific stockholders approved the proposed merger with the Company and
the closing occurred on October 31, 2006.  Under the terms of the merger
agreement, the Company agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pan
Pacific for total merger consideration of $70.00 per share.  As permitted
under the merger agreement, the Company elected to issue $10.00 per share of the
total merger consideration in the form of Common Stock.  As such, the
Company issued 9,185,847 shares of Common Stock valued at $407.7 million, which
was based upon the average closing price of the Common Stock over the ten
trading days immediately preceding the closing date.

During 2006, the
Company acquired interests in seven shopping center properties located
throughout Puerto Rico.  The properties were acquired through the issuance
of approximately $158.6 million of non-convertible units, approximately $45.8
million of convertible units, approximately $131.2 million of non-recourse debt
and $116.3 million in cash.

The convertible
units consist of (i) 2,627 Class B-1 Preferred Units, par value $10,000 per unit
and 640,001 Class C DownREIT Units, valued at an issuance price of $30.52 per
unit.  Both the Class B-1 Units and the Class C DownREIT Units are
redeemable by the holder at anytime after November 30, 2010 for cash or at the
Company’s option, shares of the Company’s common stock.  During
2007, 2,438 units, or $24.4 million, of the Class B-1 Preferred
Units were redeemed and 61,804 units, or $1.9 million, of the Class C
DownREIT Units were redeemed under the Loan provision of the
Agreement. The Company opted to settle these units in cash. Additionally, 300
units, or $3.0 million, of the Class B-2 Preferred Units were redeemed through
transfer to a charitable organization, as permitted under the provisions of
the Agreement.

The number of
shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Class B-1 Preferred Units
would be equal to the Class B-1 Cash Redemption Amount, as defined, which ranges
from $6,000 to $14,000 per Class B-1 Preferred Unit depending on the Common
Stock’s Adjusted Current Trading Price, as defined, divided by the average daily
market price for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
redemption date.

Prior to January
1, 2009, the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
Class C DownREIT Units would be equal to the Class C Cash Amount which equals
the number of Class C DownREIT Units being redeemed, multiplied by the Adjusted
Current Trading Price, as defined.  After January 1, 2009, if the Adjusted
Current Trading Price is greater than $36.62 then the Class C Cash Amount shall
be an amount equal to the Adjusted Current Trading Price per Class C DownREIT
Unit.  If the Adjusted Current Trading Price is greater than $24.41 but
less than $36.62, then the Class C Cash Amount shall be an amount equal to
$30.51 per Class C DownREIT Unit; or is less than $24.41, then the Class C Cash
Amount shall be an amount per Class C DownREIT Unit equal to the Adjusted
Current Trading Price multiplied by 1.25.

During April
2006, the Company acquired interests in two shopping center properties, located
in Bay Shore and Centereach, NY, valued at an aggregate $61.6 million.  The
properties were acquired through the issuance of units from a consolidated
subsidiary and consist of approximately $24.2 million of Redeemable Units, which
are redeemable at the option of the holder, approximately $14.0 million of fixed
rate

Redeemable Units
and the assumption of approximately $23.4 million of non-recourse mortgage debt.
The Company has the option to settle the redemption of the $24.2 million
redeemable units with Common Stock, at a ratio of 1:1, or cash.  During
2007, 30,000 units, or $1.1 million par value, of the Class B Units
were redeemed by the holder.  The Company opted to settle these units in
cash.

During June 2006,
the Company acquired an interest in an office property, located in Albany, NY,
valued at approximately $39.9 million.  The property was acquired through
the issuance of approximately $5.0 million of redeemable units from a
consolidated subsidiary, which are redeemable at the option of the holder after
one year, and the assumption of approximately $34.9 million of non-recourse
mortgage debt. The Company has the option to settle the redemption with Common
Stock, at a ratio of 1:1, or cash.

During October
2002, the Company acquired an interest in a shopping center property located in
Daly City, CA, valued at $80.0 million, through the issuance of approximately
4.8 million Convertible Units which are convertible at a ratio of 1:1 into the
Company’s common stock.  The unit holder has the right to convert the
Convertible Units at any time after one year.  In addition, the Company has
the right to mandatorily require a conversion after ten years.  If at the
time of conversion the common stock price for the 20 previous trading days is
less than $16.785 per share, the unit holder would be entitled to additional
shares; however, the maximum number of additional shares is limited to 503,932
based upon a floor Common Stock price of $15.180.  The Company has the
option to settle the conversion in cash.  Dividends on the Convertible
Units are paid quarterly at the rate of the Company’s common stock dividend
multiplied by 1.1057.

Transactions with Related Parties:

During 2006, the
Company, along with its joint venture partner, provided Kimco Retail Opportunity
Portfolio II ("KROP II") short-term interim financing for all acquisitions by
KROP II for which a mortgage was not in place at the time of closing.  All
such financing had maturities of less than one year and bore interest at a rate
of LIBOR plus 2.0%.  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, KROP II had a total of
approximately $0.00 and $22.2 million, respectively, of outstanding short-term
interim financing due to GECRE and the Company, of which the Company’s share is
50%.  The Company earned approximately $178,000 and $248,000 during 2007
and 2006, respectively, related to such interim financing.

The Company
provides management services for shopping centers owned principally by
affiliated entities and various real estate joint ventures in which certain
stockholders of the Company have economic interests.  Such services are
performed pursuant to management agreements which provide for fees based upon a
percentage of gross revenues from the properties and other direct costs incurred
in connection with management of the centers.

In December 2004,
in conjunction with the Price Legacy transaction, the Company, which holds a 15%
non-controlling interest, provided the acquiring joint venture approximately
$30.6 million of secured mezzanine financing.  This interest-only loan bore
interest at a fixed rate of 7.5% per annum payable monthly in arrears and was
repaid during 2006.  The Company also provided PL Retail a secured
short-term promissory note for approximately $8.2 million.  This interest
only note bore interest at LIBOR plus 4.5% and was scheduled to mature in June
2005.  During 2005, this note was amended to bear interest at LIBOR plus
6.0% and was payable on demand.  During 2006, PL Retail fully repaid to the
Company the promissory note.

Ripco Real Estate
Corp., was formed in 1991 and employs approximately 40 professionals and serves
numerous retailers, REITS and developers.  Ripco’s business activities
include serving as a leasing agent and representative for national and regional
retailers including Target, Best Buy, Kohls and many others, providing real
estate brokerage services and principal real estate investing.  Mr. Todd
Cooper, an officer and 50% shareholder of Ripco, is a son of Mr. Milton Cooper,
Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company.
 During 2007 and 2006, the Company paid brokerage commissions of $257,385
and $266,191, respectively, to Ripco for services rendered primarily as leasing
agent for various national tenants in shopping center properties owned by the
Company. The Company believes that the brokerage commissions paid were at or
below the customary rates for such leasing services.  Additionally, the
Company has the following joint venture investments with Ripco.

During 2005, the
Company acquired three operating properties and one land parcel, through joint
ventures, in which the Company and Ripco each hold 50% non-controlling interests
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $27.1 million, including the
assumption of approximately $9.3 million of non-recourse mortgage debt
encumbering two of the properties.  The Company accounts for its investment
in these joint ventures under the equity method of accounting.  Subsequent
to these acquisitions, the joint ventures obtained four individual one-year
loans aggregating $20.4 million with interest rates ranging from LIBOR plus
0.50% to LIBOR plus 0.55%.  During 2007, one of these properties was sold
for a sales price of approximately $10.5 million, including the pay down of $5.0
million of debt.  During 2007, two of these

term loans were
extended until May 2008 and one was extended until October 2008.  As of
December 31, 2007, there was an aggregate of $15.4 million outstanding on these
loans.  These loans are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and
the joint venture partner.

Commitments and Contingencies:

The Company and
its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the operation of shopping centers
which are either owned or held under long-term leases which expire at various
dates through 2095.  The Company and its subsidiaries, in turn, lease
premises in these centers to tenants pursuant to lease agreements which provide
for terms ranging generally from 5 to 25 years and for annual minimum rentals
plus incremental rents based on operating expense levels and tenants' sales
volumes. Annual minimum rentals plus incremental rents based on operating
expense levels comprised approximately 99% of total revenues from rental
property for each of the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

The future
minimum revenues from rental property under the terms of all non-cancellable
tenant leases, assuming no new or renegotiated leases are executed for such
premises, for future years are approximately as follows (in millions): 2008,
$503.3; 2009, $466.0; 2010, $420.0; 2011, $370.4; 2012, $319.7 and thereafter;
$1,601.8.

Minimum rental
payments under the terms of all non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to
the Company’s shopping center portfolio for future years are approximately as
follows (in millions): 2008, $11.4; 2009, $10.9; 2010, $9.0; 2011, $6.7; 2012,
$6.0; and thereafter, $115.6.

In June 2006, the
FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with
FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  The interpretation
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute criteria for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return.  The interpretation also provides
guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

The Company
adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007.  The Company does not
have any material unrecognized tax benefits, therefore the adoption of FIN 48
did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
operations.

During June 2007,
the Company entered into a joint venture, in which the Company has
non-controlling interest, and acquired all of the common stock of InTown Suites
Management, Inc.  This investment was funded with approximately $186.0
million of new cross-collateralized non-recourse mortgage debt with an interest
rate of 5.59%, encumbering 35 properties, a $153.0 million three-year unsecured
credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.325% and is guaranteed by
the Company and the assumption of $278.6 million cross-collateralized
non-recourse mortgage debt with interest rates ranging from 5.19% to 5.89%,
encumbering 86 properties. The joint venture partner has pledged its equity
interest for any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to pay. The
outstanding balance on the three-year unsecured credit facility was $149.0
million as of December 31, 2007.  The joint venture obtained an interest
rate swap at 5.37% on $128 million of this debt.  The swap is designated as
a cash flow hedge and as such adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive
income.

During 2007, the
Company entered into a joint venture, in which the Company has a non-controlling
ownership interest, to acquire a property in Houston, Texas.  This
investment was funded with a $24.5 million one-year unsecured credit facility,
with an additional one-year extension option, which bears interest at LIBOR plus
0.375% and is guaranteed by the Company. The outstanding balance on this credit
facility as of December 31, 2007 was $24.5 million.

During April
2007, the Company entered into a joint venture, in which the Company has a 50%
non-controlling ownership interest to acquire a property in Visalia, CA.
 Subsequent to this acquisition the joint venture obtained a $6.0 million
three-year promissory note which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% and


KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

has an extension
option of two-years.  This loan is jointly and severally guaranteed by the
Company and the joint venture partner.  As of December 31, 2007, the
outstanding balance on this loan was $6.0 million.

In October 2007,
the Company formed a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Kimco Insurance
Company, Inc., (“KIC”), which provides general liability insurance coverage for
all losses below the deductible under our third-party policy. The Company
entered into the Insurance Captive as part of its overall risk management
program and to stabilize its insurance costs, manage exposure and recoup
expenses through the functions of the captive program.  The Company
capitalized KIC in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. KIC
established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss
experience of the Company’s properties. KIC has engaged an independent third
party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related
deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management
programs. Premiums paid to KIC may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like
premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid to KIC may be
reimbursed by tenants pursuant to specific lease terms. The Company believes
that the addition of KIC will provide increased comprehensive insurance coverage
at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market.

The KimPru joint
ventures, entities in which the Company holds a 15% non-controlling interest,
with PREI through three separate accounts managed by PREI obtained a two-year credit
facility provided by a consortium of banks and guaranteed by the Company.
 PREI guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any guaranty
payment the Company is obligated to make.    As of December 31,
2007, there was $702.5 million outstanding under this credit facility.

During 2006, an
entity in which the Company has a preferred equity investment, located in
Montreal, Canada, obtained a non-recourse construction loan, which is
collateralized by the respective land and project improvements.
 Additionally, the Company has provided a guaranty to the lender and the
developer partner has provided an indemnity to the Company for 25% of all debt.
 As of December 31, 2007, there was CAD $72.6 million (approximately USD
$74.0 million) outstanding on this construction loan.

Additionally,
during 2006, KROP obtained a one-year $15.0 million unsecured term loan, which
bore interest at LIBOR plus 0.5%.  This loan was guaranteed by the Company
and GECRE had guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 80% of any guaranty
payment the Company was obligated to make.  During 2007, KROP paid down the
remaining balance of the loan.

The Company has
issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees
for construction loans encumbering certain of the Company’s ground-up
development projects and guaranty of payment related to the Company’s insurance
program.  These letters of credit aggregate approximately $30.7
million.

In connection
with the construction of its development projects and related infrastructure,
certain public agencies require performance and surety bonds be posted to
guarantee that the Company’s obligations are satisfied.  These bonds expire
upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure.  As of December
31, 2007, there were approximately $90.4 million bonds outstanding.

Additionally, the
RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non-controlling
interest, has a CAD $7.0 million (approximately USD $7.1 million) letter of
credit facility.  This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the
Company and had approximately CAD $5.5 million (approximately USD $5.6 million)
outstanding as of December 31, 2007, relating to various development projects.

During 2005, a
joint venture entity in which the Company has a non-controlling interest
obtained a CAD $22.5 million (approximately USD $22.9 million) credit facility
to finance the construction of a 0.1 million square foot shopping center
property located in Kamloops, B.C.  This facility bears interest at Royal
Bank Prime Rate ("RBP") plus 0.5% per annum and is scheduled to mature in March
2008.  The Company and its partner in this entity each have a limited and
several guarantee of CAD $7.5 million (approximately USD $7.6 million) on this
facility.  As of December 31, 2007, there was CAD $21.1 million
(approximately USD $21.5 million) outstanding on this facility.


KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND

During 2005, PL
Retail entered into a $39.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which
bore interest at LIBOR plus 0.675% and was scheduled to mature in February 2007.
During 2007, the loan was extended to February 2009 at a reduced rate of LIBOR
plus 0.45%.  This facility is guaranteed by the Company and the joint
venture partner has guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any
guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make.  As of December 31,
2007, there was $24.6 million outstanding under this facility.

The Company is
subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary
course of business.  These matters are generally covered by insurance.
 Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or
liquidity of the Company.

The Company
evaluated these guarantees in connection with the provisions of FASB
Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others and
determined that the impact did not have a material effect on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

21.

Incentive Plans:

The Company
maintains a stock option plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which a maximum of
42,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock may be issued for qualified and
non-qualified options. Options granted under the Plan generally vest ratably
over a three year term for grants issued prior to August 1, 2005 and five-year
term for grants issued after August 1, 2005, expire ten years from the date of
grant and are exercisable at the market price on the date of grant, unless
otherwise determined by the Board at its sole discretion. In addition, the Plan
provides for the granting of certain options to each of the Company’s
non-employee directors (the "Independent Directors") and permits such
Independent Directors to elect to receive deferred stock awards in lieu of
directors’ fees.

During December
2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS
No. 123(R)"), which is a revision of Statement 123. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes
Opinion 25.  Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the
approach described in Statement 123.  However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options,
to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values.
 Pro-forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R).
 SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31,
2005.  The Company began expensing stock based employee compensation with
its adoption of the prospective method provisions of SFAS No. 148, effective
January 1, 2003, as a result, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
operations.

The fair value of
each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing formula.  The assumption for expected volatility has a
significant affect on the grant date fair value.  Volatility is determined
based on the historical equity of common stock for the most recent historical
period equal to the expected term of the options.  The more significant
assumptions underlying the determination of fair values for options granted
during 2007, 2006, and 2005 were as follows:

employees, which permits participants to defer up to the maximum allowable
amount determined by the Internal Revenue Service of their eligible
compensation.  This deferred compensation, together with Company matching
contributions, which generally equal employee deferrals up to a maximum of 5% of
their eligible compensation (capped at $170,000), is fully vested and funded as
of December 31, 2007.  The Company contributions to the plan were
approximately $1.5 million, $1.3 million, and $1.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Income Taxes:

The Company
elected to qualify as a REIT in accordance with the Code commencing with its
taxable year which began January 1, 1992.  To qualify as a REIT, the
Company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements,
including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its
adjusted REIT taxable income to its stockholders.  It is management’s
intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the Company’s REIT
status.  As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to corporate
federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at
least the amount of its REIT taxable income as defined under the Code.  If
the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject
to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable
alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four
subsequent taxable years.  Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a
REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and
property, and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable
income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through
taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to federal, state and local income
taxes.

ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 cash dividends paid exceeded the dividends paid
deduction and amounted to $384,502 and $332,552, respectively.  For the
year ended December 31, 2005, cash dividends paid were equal to the dividend
paid deduction and amounted to $293,345.

Characterization
of Distributions:

Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries ("TRS"):

The Company is
subject to federal, state and local income taxes on the income from its TRS
activities, which include Kimco Realty Services ("KRS"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company and the consolidated entities of FNC, Kimsouth and
Blue Ridge Real Estate Company/Big Boulder Corporation.

Income taxes have
been provided for on the asset and liability method as required by SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes.  Under the asset and liability method,
deferred income taxes are recognized for the temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the TRS assets and
liabilities.

The Company’s
taxable income for book purposes and provision for income taxes relating to the
Company’s TRS and taxable entities which have been consolidated for accounting
reporting purposes, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, are
summarized as follows (in thousands):

The Company’s
deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006, were as
follows (in thousands):

Deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities are included in the caption Other assets and
Other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December
31, 2007 and 2006.  Operating losses and the valuation allowance are due to
the Company’s consolidation of FNC and Kimsouth for accounting and reporting
purposes.  At December 31, 2007, FNC had approximately $128.1 million of
net operating loss carry forwards that expire from 2022 through 2025, with a tax
value of approximately $50.0 million.  A valuation allowance of $33.8
million has been established for a portion of these deferred tax assets.
 At December 31, 2007, Kimsouth had approximately $37.9 million of net
operating loss carrying forwards that expire from 2021 to 2023, with a tax value
of approximately $14.8 million.  A valuation allowance for $3.1 million has
been established for a portion of these deferred tax assets.  Other
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to differences
in the timing of the recognition of income/(loss) between the GAAP and tax basis
of accounting for (i) real estate joint ventures, (ii) other real estate
investments, and (iii) other deductible temporary differences.  The Company
believes that, based on its operating strategy and consistent history of
profitability, it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of
$35.4 million will be realized on future tax returns, primarily from the
generation of future taxable income.
