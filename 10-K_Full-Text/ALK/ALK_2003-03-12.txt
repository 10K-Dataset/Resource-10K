PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL INFORMATION

Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group or the Company) is a holding company that was
incorporated in Delaware in 1985. Its two principal subsidiaries are Alaska
Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Both
subsidiaries operate as airlines, although their business plans, competition,
and economic risks differ substantially. Alaska is a major airline, operates
an all-jet fleet, and its average passenger trip length is 932 miles. Horizon
is a regional airline, operates jet and turboprop aircraft, and its average
passenger trip is 314 miles. Individual financial information for Alaska and
Horizon is reported in Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Air
Group’s executive offices are located at 19300 Pacific Highway South, Seattle,
Washington, 98188. Air Group’s filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are
accessible free of charge at WWW.alaskaair.com. As used in this
Form 10-K, the terms “Air Group” “our,” “we” and the
“Company” refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its
subsidiaries, unless the conduct indicates otherwise.

Alaska

Alaska Airlines, Inc. is an Alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and
incorporated in 1937. Alaska principally serves 38 cities in six western
states (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, and Arizona) and Canada
and six cities in Mexico. Alaska also provides non-stop service between
Seattle and four eastern cities (Washington, D.C., Boston, Miami, and Newark),
between Seattle and Denver, and between Anchorage and Chicago. In each year
since 1973, Alaska has carried more passengers between Alaska and the U.S.
mainland than any other airline. In 2002, Alaska carried 14.2 million revenue
passengers. Passenger traffic within Alaska and between Alaska and the U.S.
mainland accounted for 23% of Alaska’s 2002 revenue passenger miles, West Coast
traffic (including Canada) accounted for 56%, the Mexico markets 11% and other
markets 10%. Based on passenger enplanements, Alaska’s leading airports are
Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, and Anchorage. Based on 2002 revenues, its
leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Anchorage, Seattle-Los Angeles, and
Seattle-San Diego. At December 31, 2002, Alaska’s operating fleet consisted of
102 jet aircraft.

Horizon

Horizon Air Industries, Inc., a Washington corporation that first began
service in 1981, was incorporated in 1982 and was acquired by Air
Group in 1986. It is the largest regional airline in the Pacific
Northwest, and serves 40 cities in seven states (Washington, Oregon, Montana,
Idaho, California, Colorado and Arizona) and five cities in Canada. In 2002,
Horizon carried 4.8 million revenue passengers. Based on passenger
enplanements, Horizon’s leading airports are Seattle, Portland, Boise, and
Spokane. Based on revenues in 2002, its leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Portland,
Seattle-Boise, Seattle-Spokane and Seattle-Vancouver. At December 31, 2002,
Horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 20 jet and 43 turboprop aircraft, with
the jets providing 49% of the 2002 capacity. Horizon flights are listed under
the Alaska Airlines designator code in airline computer reservation systems.

Alaska and Horizon coordinate their flight schedules to provide service between
any two points served by their systems. In 2002, 29% of Horizon’s passengers
connected to Alaska. Both airlines



distinguish themselves from competitors by
providing a higher level of customer service. The airlines’ excellent service
in the form of advance seat assignments, expedited check-in, attention to
customer needs, high-quality food and beverage service, well-maintained
aircraft, a first-class section aboard Alaska aircraft, and other amenities is regularly recognized by
independent studies and surveys of air travelers.

Industry Conditions

On September 11, 2001, the United States was attacked by terrorists using four
hijacked jets of two U.S. airlines. These attacks and a weakened U.S. economy
during 2002 have resulted in lower demand for air service. Throughout 2002,
several major carriers (excluding the Company) have reduced service, grounded
aircraft and furloughed employees. United Airlines and US Airways have sought
relief from financial obligations in bankruptcy. Other smaller carriers have
ceased operations entirely. America West Airlines, US Airways and others have received
federal loan guarantees (or conditional approval for guarantees) authorized by
federal law and additional airlines may do so in the future. In addition,
credit rating agencies continue to downgrade the long-term credit ratings of
most U.S. airlines and their related entities, including Alaska Air Group, Inc.

On September 22, 2001, the U.S. Government passed the Air Transportation Safety
and System Stabilization Act (the Act) to provide $5 billion of cash
compensation and $10 billion of loan guarantees to U.S. airlines. The purpose
of the Act was to compensate the airlines for direct and incremental losses for
the period September 11 through December 31, 2001 as a result of the September
11 terrorist attacks. As of December 31, 2001, Alaska had recognized $71.6
million and Horizon had recognized $9.8 million of the $5 billion cash
compensation. During the third quarter of 2002, the United States Department
of Transportation (DOT) completed its review procedures and remitted final
compensation payments to Alaska and Horizon of $0.2 million and $0.2 million,
respectively.

The current U.S. domestic airline
environment continues to be difficult. The Company has reported
annual losses since 2000, and current trends in the airline industry
make it likely that it will post additional losses before returning
to profitability. The revenue environment continues to be weak in
light of vigorous competition, excess capacity in the market, reduced
corporate travel spending and other issues. In addition, fuel prices
have significantly escalated due to supply and demand trends as well
as political tensions in several regions of the world.

We believe that our liquidity and
access to cash will be sufficient to fund our current operations at
least through 2003, although adverse factors outside our control such
as further economic recession, additional terrorist attacks, a war
affecting the United States, decreased consumer demand or sustained
high fuel prices could affect this projection.

See Item 1,
“Business — Risk Factors” and Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Overview” for further
discussion of perceived trends and factors affecting us and our
industry.



MARKETING AND COMPETITION

Alliances with Other Airlines

Alaska and Horizon have marketing alliances with other airlines that provide
reciprocal frequent flyer mileage accrual and redemption privileges and
codesharing on certain flights as set forth below. Alliances enhance Alaska’s
and Horizon’s revenues by offering our customers more travel destinations and
better mileage accrual/redemption opportunities, gaining us access to more
connecting traffic from other airlines, and providing members of our alliance
partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska and
Horizon while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs.
Alaska’s and Horizon’s marketing agreements have various termination
dates and at any time, one or more may be in the process of
renegotiation. If a significant agreement were terminated, it could
adversely impact revenues and increase the costs of the Company’s
other marketing agreements. Most of the Company’s Codeshare
relationships are free-sell codeshares, where the marketing carrier
sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the
operating carrier’s inventory, but takes no inventory risk. The
table below identities the Company’s marketing alliances with
other airlines as of February 28, 2003.

This airline does not have its own frequent flyer program. However, Alaska’s
Mileage Plan members can accrue and redeem miles on this airline’s route
system.

Competition

Competition in the airline industry is intense. The Company believes
the principal competitive factors in the industry are fare pricing,
customer service, routes served, flight schedules, type of aircraft,
safety record and reputation, code-sharing relationships, and
frequent flyer programs. Any domestic air
carrier deemed fit by the DOT is allowed to operate scheduled passenger service
in the United States. Together, Alaska and Horizon carry approximately 2.8% of
all U.S. domestic passenger traffic. Alaska and Horizon compete with one or
more domestic or foreign airlines on most of their routes. Some of these
competitors are substantially larger than Alaska and Horizon, have greater
financial resources, and have more extensive route systems. Due to its
shorthaul



markets, Horizon also competes with ground transportation, including
train, bus and automobile transportation.

Most major U.S. carriers have developed, independently or in partnership with
others, large computer reservation systems (CRS). Airlines, including Alaska
and Horizon, are charged fees to have their flight schedules included in the
various CRS displays used by travel agencies and airlines. These systems are
currently the predominant means of distributing airline tickets. In order to
reduce anti-competitive practices, the DOT regulates the display of all airline
schedules and fares in CRS. Air carriers are increasingly distributing their
services on the Internet through various airline joint venture or independent
websites. The Company currently participates in a number of these distribution
channels, but it cannot predict the terms on which it may be able to continue
to participate in these or other sites, or their effect on the Company’s
ability to compete with other airlines.

REGULATION

General

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as amended, eliminated most domestic
economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation. However, the DOT
and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) still exercise regulatory authority over air
carriers. In order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation
in the U.S., a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of
public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT. Subject to
certain individual airport capacity, noise and other restrictions,
this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two
points in the U.S. A certificate is of unlimited duration, but may be revoked for
failure to comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders
or the terms of the certificate itself. In addition, the DOT maintains jurisdiction over the approval of international
codeshare agreements, alliance agreements between domestic major airlines,
international route authorities and certain consumer protection matters, such
as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability.

The FAA regulates aircraft operations generally, including establishing
personnel, maintenance and flight operation standards. Domestic
airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier
operating certificate issued by the FAA. Pursuant to
these regulations, we have established, and the FAA has approved, a
maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate that
provides for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft, ranging from
frequent routine inspections to major overhauls. In addition, the FAA has issued a number of directives that the Company is
incorporating into its aircraft. These relate to, among other things, enhanced
ground proximity warning systems, cockpit door security enhancements, McDonnell
Douglas MD-80 insulation blanket replacement, MD-80 main landing gear piston
improvements and Boeing 737 rudder and elevator improvements. Based on its
current implementation schedule, the Company is or expects to be in compliance
with the applicable requirements within the required time periods.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) has jurisdiction over airline antitrust
matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the
transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air
transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests
in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to
disputes



between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and
collective bargaining agreements. To the extent the Company continues to pursue
alliances with international carriers, the Company may be subject to certain
regulations of foreign agencies.

In November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the Security
Act) was enacted. The Security Act created a new government agency, the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is part of the DOT and is
responsible for aviation security. The Security Act mandates that the TSA shall
provide for the screening of all passengers and property, including U.S. mail,
cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that will be carried
aboard a passenger aircraft. The TSA assumed most passenger screening functions
in February 2002, largely by contracting with private-sector security
providers; however, in November 2002, the TSA began performing these functions
with its own federal employees. On December 31, 2002, the TSA began explosive
detection screening of all checked baggage

.

The TSA also provides for
increased security on flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air
marshals to be present on certain flights.

Effective February 1, 2002, the Security Act imposed a $2.50 per enplanement
security service fee (maximum $5.00 one-way maximum fee) which is collected by
the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced
security measures. Additionally, to the extent the TSA determines that such fee
is insufficient to pay for the cost of providing the security measures as
mentioned in the previous paragraph, in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004,
air carriers may be required to submit to the government an amount equal to the
amount the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000.
After that, this fee may be assessed based on the air carrier’s market share.
In 2002, the TSA began assessing payments under this feature of the Security
Act. The Company paid $9.9 million to the TSA for this security charge in
2002.

In addition, the Security Act requires air carriers to honor tickets, on a
standby basis, from other air carriers that are insolvent or bankrupt and
suspend service within 18 months of the passage of the Security Act. To be
eligible, a passenger must make arrangements with the air carrier within
60 days after the date on which the passenger’s air transportation was
suspended. Because this provision is so recent, the Company has little history
to determine its impact. If a major U.S. air carrier were to declare
bankruptcy and cease operations, this feature of the Security Act
could have an impact on the Company. To the extent the Company is not fully
reimbursed for the costs of honoring such tickets, the impact could be adverse.

The DOT, under its authority to prevent unfair competitive practices in the
industry, has considered the issuance of pricing and capacity rules that would
limit major air carriers’ competitive response to new entrant carriers.
Although the DOT as recently as 2001 declined to issue specific competitive
guidelines, it reiterated its intent to prevent what it considers to be unfair
competitive practices in the industry, and to pursue enforcement actions on a
case-by-case basis. To the extent that future DOT enforcement actions either
directly or indirectly impose restrictions upon the Company’s ability to
respond to competitors, the Company’s business may be adversely impacted.

Airline Fares

Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without
governmental regulation,



and the industry is characterized by substantial price
competition. The DOT maintains authority over international fares, rates and
charges. International fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of
the governments of the foreign countries the Company serves. While air carriers
are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs,
substantial commissions, overrides and discounts to travel agents, brokers and
wholesalers characterize many international markets.

Legislation (sometimes referred to as the “Passengers’ Bill of Rights”) has
been discussed in various legislatures (including the Congress). This
legislation could, if enacted: (i) place various limitations on airline fares
and/or (ii) affect operating practices such as baggage handling and
overbooking. Effective December 15, 1999, the Company, as well as other
domestic airlines, implemented a Customer Service Plan to address a number of
service goals, including, but not limited to goals relating to: (i) lowest fare
availability, (ii) delays, cancellations and diversion events, (iii) baggage
delivery and liability, (iv) guaranteed fares, (v) ticket refunds, (vi)
accommodation of customers with special needs, (vii) essential customer needs
during extraordinary delays, (viii) flight oversales, (ix) frequent flyer
program, (x) other travel policies, (xi) service with domestic code share
partners, and (xii) handling of customer issues. In February 2001, the DOT
Inspector General issued a report on the various air carriers’ performance of
their Customer Service Plans. The report included a number of recommendations
which could limit the Company’s flexibility with respect to various operational
practices. In February 2001, a bill proposing an “Airline Customer Service
Improvement Act” was introduced in the U.S. Senate. In addition, other items of
legislation have been introduced that would limit hub concentration, reallocate
slots at certain airports and impose higher landing fees at certain hours. To
the extent legislation is enacted that would inhibit the Company’s flexibility
with respect to fares, its revenue management system, its operations or other
aspects of its customer service operations, the Company’s financial results
could be adversely affected.

Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on the
Company’s financial results because the Company is generally required to match
competitors’ fares to maintain passenger traffic. During recent years, a number
of new low-cost airlines have entered the
domestic market and several major airlines, including the Company, implemented
efforts to lower their cost structures. Further fare reductions, domestic and
international, may occur in the future. If fare reductions are not offset by
increases in passenger traffic, cost reductions or changes in the mix of
traffic that improves yields, the Company’s operating results will be
negatively impacted.

Airport Access

Many heavily used airports have restrictions with respect to the number of
permitted take-offs and landings, the total permitted annual seat capacity to
be operated at an airport, the use or allocation of airport slots, or other
restrictions. The Company currently has sufficient slot authorizations to
operate its existing flights and has generally been able to obtain slots to
expand its operations and change its schedules. However, there is no assurance
that the Company will be able to obtain slots for these purposes in the future
because, among other factors, domestic slot allocations are subject to changes
in government policies.



Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning
environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other
countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on the Company
include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), the Clean Air Act,
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe
Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA or the Superfund Act). The Company is also subject to
the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized
to promulgate regulations that have an impact on the Company’s operations. In
addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated
certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and
local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health
laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. As a
part of its continuing safety, health and environmental program, the Company
anticipates that it will comply with such requirements without any material
adverse effect on its business.

The ANCA recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to
implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere
unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air
transportation system. Authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft
noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The
ANCA generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft.
While the Company has had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate
local noise restrictions imposed to date, the Company’s operations at those
airports could be adversely affected if such regulations become more
restrictive or widespread.

The Company does not expect these regulatory matters, individually or
collectively, to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

EMPLOYEES

The airline business is labor intensive. Alaska and Horizon had 11,039 and
3,904, respectively, active full-time and part-time employees at December 31,
2002. Wages, salaries and benefits represented approximately 37% of the
Company’s total operating expenses in 2002.

At December 31, 2002, labor
unions represented 83% of Alaska’s and 46% of
Horizon’s employees. The Company’s relations with such labor organizations are
governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under this act, the collective
bargaining agreements among the Company and these organizations do not expire
but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to
modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the
manner described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties
must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party
may request the NMB to appoint a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached
in mediation, the NMB may declare at some time that an impasse exists, at which
point the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may
decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a
30-day “cooling off” period commences. During that period, a Presidential
Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions
and recommends a solution. The PEB process



lasts for 30 days and is followed by
a “cooling off” period of 30 days. At the end of a “cooling off” period, unless
an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization
may strike and the airline may resort to “self-help”, including the imposition
of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of workers to replace
strikers.

A number of Alaska’s collective bargaining
agreements contain provisions for interest arbitration. Under interest
arbitration, if the parties
have not negotiated the contract by a predetermined date, then such side
may submit a limited number of issues to binding arbitration.
The arbitrator’s decision on those open points then becomes part of the
collective bargaining agreement, and no strike or company self-help will occur.
The union contract with the Alaska Airlines pilots, among others, contains an
interest arbitration provision. Alaska is currently in negotiations
with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association and the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers Union, representing its clerical, office and
passenger service work group.

FUEL

The Company’s operations are significantly affected by the availability and
price of jet fuel. Fuel costs were 13.1% of the Company’s total operating
expenses in 2002. Fuel prices, which can be volatile and which are outside of
the Company’s control, can have a significant impact on the Company’s operating
results. Currently, a one-cent change in the fuel price per gallon affects
annual fuel costs by approximately $3.8 million. The Company believes that
operating fuel-

efficient aircraft is an effective hedge against high fuel prices. The Company
also purchases fuel hedge contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in
the price of jet fuel. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry,
in the event of continuing increases in the price of jet fuel, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to pass on increased fuel prices to its
customers by increasing its fares. Likewise, any potential benefit of lower
fuel prices may be offset by increased fare competition and lower revenues for
all air carriers.

While the Company does not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel
availability, dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of
changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and
marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel. In
the event there was an outbreak of hostilities or other conflicts in oil
producing areas, there could be reductions in the production and/or importation
of crude oil. If there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel,
the Company’s business would be adversely affected. See Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a
discussion of the Company’s fuel hedging activities.

FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM

All major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of
increasing passenger loyalty. Alaska’s Mileage Plan allows members to earn
mileage by flying on Alaska, Horizon and other participating airlines, and by
using the services of non-airline partners, which include a credit card
partner, telephone companies, hotels, and car rental agencies. Alaska is paid
by non-airline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts. With
advance notice, Alaska has the ability to change the Mileage Plan terms,
conditions, partners, mileage credits, and award levels.

Mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel
industry awards. Upon accumulating the necessary mileage, members notify
Alaska of their award selection. Over 75% of the free flight awards on Alaska
and Horizon are subject to blackout dates and capacity-controlled seating.
Mileage Plan  miles do not expire. As of December 31, 2001 and 2002, Alaska
estimated that 1,740,000 and 2,067,000, respectively, round-trip flight awards
were eligible for redemption by Mileage Plan members who have mileage credits
exceeding the 20,000-mile free round-trip domestic ticket award threshold. Of
those eligible awards, Alaska estimated that 1,618,000 and 1,931,000,
respectively, would ultimately be redeemed. For the years 2000, 2001 and 2002,
approximately 281,000, 310,000, and 441,000 round-trip flight awards were
redeemed and flown on Alaska and Horizon. Those awards represent approximately
4.8% for 2000, 5.2% for 2001 and 6.8% for 2002 of the total passenger miles
flown for each period. For the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, approximately
137,000, 154,000 and 174,000 round-trip flight awards were redeemed and flown
on airline partners.

For miles earned by flying on Alaska and travel partners, the estimated
incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling
expense and accrued as a liability as miles



are accumulated. The incremental
cost does not include a contribution to overhead, aircraft cost, or profit.
Alaska also sells mileage credits to non-airline partners, such as hotels, car
rental agencies, and a credit card company. Alaska defers a majority of the
sales proceeds, and recognizes these proceeds as revenue when the award
transportation is provided. The deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger
revenue for awards issued on Alaska and as other revenue-net for awards issued
on other airlines. At December 31, 2001 and 2002, the deferred revenue and
the total liability for miles outstanding and for estimated payments to partner
airlines was $248.3 million and $303.0 million, respectively.

OTHER INFORMATION

Seasonality and Other Factors

The Company’s results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily
indicative of those for the entire year, since the air transportation business
is subject to seasonal fluctuations. The business of the Company is somewhat
seasonal. Quarterly operating income tends to peak during the third quarter.

The results of operations in the air transportation business have also
significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic
conditions. In addition, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor
actions and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern.

No material part of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries is
dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. Consequently, the loss
of the Company’s largest few customers would not have a materially adverse
effect upon the Company.

Insurance

The Company carries insurance for public liability, passenger liability,
property damage and all-risk coverage for damage to its aircraft, in amounts
which, in the opinion of management, are adequate.

As a result of the September 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have
significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to
commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or
passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events
(war-risk coverage). At the same time, they significantly increased the
premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general.

Pursuant to authority granted in the Act, the Government has offered, and the
Company has accepted, war risk insurance to replace commercial insurance for
renewable 60-day periods until August 31, 2003. In the event the Government
fails to renew war-risk insurance and the Company is unable to replace such
insurance in the commercial market, the Company’s business,
financial condition and results of operations would be adversely
impacted.

Other Government Matters

The Company has elected to participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF)
program, whereby it has agreed to make available to the federal government a
certain number of aircraft in the event of a military call-up. The government
would reimburse the Company for the use of such aircraft.



BUSINESS RISKS

The Company’s operations and financial results are subject to various
uncertainties, such as global and industry instability, intense competition,
volatile fuel prices, a largely unionized labor force, the need to finance
large capital expenditures, government regulation, potential aircraft incidents
and general economic conditions.

The September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks negatively impacted the Company’s
business and further
threatened or actual terrorist attacks or hostilities involving the
U.S. may harm the Company’s business in the
future.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath have negatively
impacted the Company and the airline industry, generally. Since a substantial
portion of airline travel, for both business and leisure, is discretionary,
further terrorist activity connected with air travel, or the threat of further
terrorist activity, could result in travelers canceling or deferring their
plans for air travel and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the temporary shutdown of domestic
passenger air travel and reduced demand for air travel led Alaska to reduce its
flight schedule by approximately 13% and Horizon to reduce its flight schedule
by approximately 20%. Because a substantial portion of the Company’s costs are
fixed in the short term, however, Air Group was unable to offset the reduction
in customer demand through cost savings, and the Company’s operating results
were harmed to a proportionately greater degree. In addition, actual or
threatened terrorist activity could:

Additional terrorist attacks, the fear
of such attacks, increased hostilities or U.S. military involvement
in Iraq, the Middle
East or other regions could have a further negative impact on the
airline industry and further enhance the risks described above and may also lead to increased cost and
volatility in fuel prices. The occurrance of any of these events could
significantly harm the Company’s business and results of
operations.

Continued weakness in the general economy, and in the airline industry in
particular, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.

vp

Air Group believes that airline traffic, including business traffic, is
particularly sensitive to changes in economic growth and expectations. In
2002, weak economic growth contributed to the airline industry suffering
significant losses, which are expected to continue in 2003. During 2002, both
U.S. Airways and United Airlines filed for bankruptcy. Because airlines
operating under bankruptcy protection receive increased flexibility to reduce
their costs by voiding contracts and renegotiating existing business
obligations, current and future airline bankruptcies could have a



substantial
impact on industry competition. In the event airlines who have received
bankruptcy protection choose to apply some or all of the cost savings they
obtain toward reduced fares, bankruptcy by airlines who compete with Air Group
may cause the Company to reduce its fares and result in a substantial reduction
in revenue and operating margin. Continued weakness in the airline industry
may also result in additional industry consolidation, greater reliance on
industry alliances, such as code-sharing and frequent flyer reciprocity
arrangements, and increased price competition among existing carriers, each of
which could dramatically alter the competitive environment in the markets the
Company serves and harm the Company’s operating
results. Continued weak economic
performance in the airline industry may also result in a further reduction in
Air Group’s credit rating and make it more difficult for the Company to raise
capital on economical terms. Any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a
result of a soft economy would harm the Company’s business.

Air Group incurred operating losses in each year since 2000 and may incur
substantial operating losses in the future.

For the year ended, December 31, 2002, Air Group incurred an operating loss of
$88.9 million. Prior to that, the Company incurred operating losses of $126.3
million and $33.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and December
31, 2000, respectively. The inability to achieve or sustain profitability may
hinder the Company’s ability to honor its existing obligations as they become
due, to obtain future equity or debt financing or to do so on economical terms,
and to sustain and expand its business.

The Company’s indebtedness could increase the volatility of its earnings and
otherwise restrict its activities.

The Company, like many airlines, has and will continue to have for the
foreseeable future a significant amount of indebtedness. Due to its high fixed
costs, including aircraft lease commitments and debt service, a decrease in
revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings. As of
December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately $905.3 million of indebtedness
outstanding, comprised of approximately $893.5 million in debt and
approximately $11.8 million of capital lease obligations.

The Company’s outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences. For
example, it could:

•

limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing
to fund its growth strategy, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
working capital or other purposes;

•

require the Company to dedicate a material portion of its
operating cash flow to fund interest payments on indebtedness,
thereby reducing funds available for other purposes; and

•

limit the Company’s ability to withstand competitive
pressures and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing
business and economic conditions, including reacting to any
economic slowdown in the airline industry.

In addition, the Company has an ongoing need to finance new aircraft
deliveries, and there is no



v

assurance that such financing will be available to
the Company in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms. Alaska
Airlines’ credit
facility also contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit the
Company’s ability to engage in activities that may be in its long-term best
interests. The Company’s failure to comply with those covenants could result in
an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the
acceleration of the repayment of all of the Company’s debts. See Item 7 “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for
further discussion of liquidity and capital resources.

If Alaska fails to comply with financial covenants, some of its financing
agreements may be terminated.

Alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain
agreements, primarily its $150 million revolving credit facility. The Company
cannot ensure that Alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions
or that these requirements will not limit the Company’s ability to finance its future
operations or capital needs. Alaska’s inability to comply with the
required financial maintenance covenants or provisions could result in default
under these financing agreements and would result in a cross default under its
other financing agreements. In the event of any such default and
Alaska’s or the Company’s
inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under the
agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable. If
Alaska
did not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that become due and
payable, it would have to seek additional debt or equity financing, which may
not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing were not
available, Alaska would have to sell assets in order to obtain the funds
required to make accelerated payments or risk its aircraft becoming subject to
repossession, which could harm the Company’s business.

The Company’s quarterly results can fluctuate substantially.

The airline industry is characterized generally by low profit margins and high
fixed costs, primarily for personnel, aircraft fuel, debt service and rent. The
expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of
passengers carried and, as a result, a relatively small change in the number of
passengers or in pricing could have a disproportionate effect on an airline’s
operating and financial results. Accordingly, a minor shortfall in expected
revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on the
Company’s operating results. In addition to passenger loads, factors that
could cause the Company’s quarterly operating results to vary include:

•

the timing and success of the Company’s growth plans as it increases flights in existing markets and enters new markets;

•

changes in fuel, security and insurance costs;

•

increases in personnel, marketing, aircraft ownership and other operating expenses to support the Company’s anticipated growth; and

•

the timing and amount of maintenance expenditures.

In addition, seasonal variations in traffic, various expenditures and
weather affect the Company’s operating results from quarter to quarter. Air
Group tends to experience the highest levels of traffic and revenue during the
third quarter of each year. Given the Company’s high
proportion



of fixed
costs, seasonality can affect its profitability from quarter to quarter. Many
of the Company’s areas of operations experience bad weather conditions in the
winter, causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft, canceled
flights and accommodating displaced passengers. Due to its geographic area of
operations, the Company can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions
than some of its competitors, which may be better able to spread
weather-related risks over larger route systems.

Due to the factors described above, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of the
Company’s operating results may not be good indicators of its future
performance. In addition, it is possible that in any future quarter the
Company’s operating results could be below the expectations of investors and
any published reports or analyses regarding Air Group. In that event, the
price of Air Group’s common stock could decline, perhaps substantially.

Increases in fuel costs would harm Air Group’s business.

Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of the Company’s total operating
expenses, comprising 13.1% of total operating expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2002. Significant increases in fuel costs would harm Air Group’s
financial condition and results of operations. The Company estimates that for
the year ended December 31, 2002, a one-cent increase in the price per gallon
of fuel expense would have increased its fuel expenses by $3.8 million.

Historically, fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations based on
geopolitical issues and supply and demand. Fuel availability is also subject to
periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for both home
heating oil and gasoline. Because of the effect of these events on the price
and availability of fuel, the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be
predicted with any degree of certainty. In the event of a fuel supply shortage,
higher fuel prices or the curtailment of scheduled service could result. Some
of the Company’s competitors may have more leverage in obtaining fuel. The
Company may be unable to offset increases in the price of fuel through higher
fares. To hedge its exposure to fuel price fluctuations, the Company began
purchasing hedging instruments, primarily crude oil swaps during 2000. At December 31, 2002,
the Company had swap agreements for crude oil contracts in place to hedge
approximately 35% of its 2003 expected jet fuel requirements. The Company
cannot be certain, however, that its fuel hedging contracts will be sufficient
to adequately protect it against fuel price increases.

Many of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements. A failure to negotiate new agreements, or to do so on terms
competitive with the labor costs and practices of the Company’s competitors,
could disrupt the Company’s business and increase its costs.

As of December 31, 2002, labor
unions represented 83% of Alaska’s and 46% of
Horizon’s employees. Alaska is currently in negotiations with
the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers union, representing its clerical, office and
passenger service work group. Horizon is currently in negotiations
with its flight attendants union. Labor costs generally are a significant component
of the Company’s total expenses, comprising 37% of its total operating expenses
in 2002. Each of the Company’s different employee groups may require separate
collective bargaining agreements, and may make demands that would increase the
Company’s operating expenses and adversely affect its profitability. If Air
Group were unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining
agreement with any group of its employees or the Company were to experience



widespread employee dissatisfaction, the Company could be subject to work
slowdowns or stoppages. The Company could also become subject to protests or
picketing by organized labor groups representing its employees. Any of these
events would be disruptive to the Company’s operations and could harm its
business. In the event any agreement the Company reaches with an organized
labor group requires it to pay wages or to incur costs that are materially
higher than those it currently pays or the Company is unable to fully offset
such increased costs through fare increases, its expenses would increase and
its operating margin would be harmed.

The airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid environmental
change. The Company may be unable to compete effectively against other
airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs, or to
adjust rapidly enough in the event the basis of competition in its markets
changes.

The airline industry is highly competitive as to fares, flight frequency,
frequent flyer benefits, routes and service. The industry is particularly
susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to
provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. The Company
currently competes with one or more other airlines on all of its routes. Many
of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial
resources, name recognition or lower operating costs than Air Group. Some of
these competitors have chosen from time to time to add service, reduce their
fares or both, in the Company’s markets. The Company may be unable to compete
effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares
in the markets that it serves.

In recent years, and particularly since its deregulation in 1978, the airline
industry has undergone substantial consolidation, and it may undergo additional
consolidation in the future. For example, in April 2001, American Airlines
acquired the majority of Trans World Airlines’ assets. In addition, many
airlines, including the Company, have marketing alliances with other airlines.
Among other things, they share the use of two-letter flight designator codes to
identify their flights and fares in the computerized reservation systems and
permit reciprocity in their frequent flyer programs. Any consolidation or
significant alliance activity within the airline industry, or the Company’s
loss of key alliance relationships, could result in the Company’s competitors
having access to larger route networks and resources than Air Group, which, in
turn, could increase the risks of competition described above.

The airline industry also faces competition from ground transportation
alternatives, such as the bus, train or automobile. Video teleconferencing and
other methods of electronic communication may add a new dimension of
competition to the industry as business travelers seek lower-cost substitutes
for air travel.

Changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and
restrictions on the Company’s operations could increase its operating costs and
result in service delays and disruptions.

Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements, both
domestically and



internationally, that involve significant compliance costs. In
the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and the DOT and the FAA have
issued regulations relating to the operation of airlines that have required
significant expenditures. For example, on November 19, 2001, the President
signed into law the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the Security
Act). This law federalizes substantially all aspects of civil aviation security
and requires among other things, the implementation of certain security
measures by airlines and airports, such as the requirement that all passenger
bags be screened for explosives. Funding for airline and airport security under
the law is primarily provided by a new $2.50 per enplanement ticket tax, with
authority granted to the TSA to impose additional fees on the air carriers if
necessary to cover additional federal aviation security costs. Implementation
of the requirements of the Security Act will result in increased costs for the
Company and its passengers. In addition to increased costs, the security
measures required to be implemented under the Security Act as well as
additional security measures issued by the FAA have on occasion resulted in a
longer check-in process for passengers and caused delays and disruptions in
airline service, which has led to customer frustration and may reduce the
demand for airline travel. Additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport
rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly
increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel. If
adopted, these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices,
reducing revenue and increasing costs.

The Company’s insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and further increases in insurance costs
would harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, aviation insurers dramatically
increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the maximum
amount of insurance coverage available to airlines for liability to persons
other than passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or
similar events to $50 million per event and in the aggregate. In light of this
development, under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, the government is currently offering
domestic airlines either (i) excess third-party liability war risk coverage
above $50 million, or (ii) in lieu of private war risk insurance, full hull and
passenger and third-party liability coverage. Either of these coverages can be
obtained with limits up to twice the carrier’s pre-9/11 limits, up to $3.0
billion. The Company has obtained the latter coverage at twice its prior
limit.

Aviation insurers could increase their premiums even further in the event of
additional terrorist attacks, hijackings, airline crashes or other events
adversely affecting the airline industry. Furthermore, the full hull and
passenger and third-party liability coverage provided by the government is
available for renewable 60-day periods until August 31, 2003. While the
government may extend the deadline for when it will stop providing
such coverage, the Company cannot be certain that any extension will occur, or
if it does, how long the extension will last. It is expected that should the
government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry, the premiums
charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher
than the premiums currently charged by the government. Significant increases in
insurance premiums would adversely impact the Company’s
business, financial condition and results of
operations.



The Company’s failure to successfully expand its business could harm its
financial condition and results of operations.

A part of the Company’s current profitability strategy involves
increasing the frequency of flights in markets it currently serves, expanding
the number of markets served and increasing flight connection opportunities.
The Company believes that growth will allow it to achieve additional economies of scale
and to manage unit costs. Increasing the number of markets the Company serves
depends on its ability to access suitable airports, facilities and in some cases regulatory approvals. Any condition that would deny, limit or delay access to such
airports, facilities or approvals would constrain the Company’s ability to
grow. In addition, successful growth depends on the Company’s ability to
maintain yields and load factors at profitable levels. Inadequate revenues in
new markets may require the Company to revise its current growth strategy. Air
Group cannot be certain that it will be able to successfully expand its
existing markets or establish new markets, and the failure to do so could harm
the Company’s business and results of operations.

The Company’s reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of
an airline accident or incident.

An accident or incident involving
one of the Company’s aircraft, such as the loss of Alaska
Flight 261 off the coast of California in January 2000, could involve a
significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith in the Company’s
airlines by the flying public. In addition, Air Group could experience
significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives,
as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its
consequential temporary or permanent loss from service. Airlines are required
by the DOT to carry liability insurance. Although the Company believes it
currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally
consistent with industry practice, the amount of such coverage may not be
adequate and Air Group may be forced to bear substantial losses from an
accident. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of the
Company’s related insurance coverage would harm Air Group’s business and
financial results. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully
insured and even if it does not involve one of the Company’s airlines, could
cause a public perception that Air Group’s airlines or the equipment it flies
is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives, which would harm the Company’s business.

The Company’s operations are often affected by factors beyond its control,
including traffic congestion at airports, weather conditions and increased
security measures, any of which could harm its operating results and financial
condition and results of operations.

Like other airlines, the Company’s operations are subject to delays caused by
factors beyond its control, including air traffic congestion at airports,
adverse weather conditions and increased security measures. Delays frustrate
passengers, reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs, all of which in
turn affect profitability. During periods of fog, snow, rain, storms or other
adverse weather conditions, flights may be cancelled or significantly delayed.
Cancellations or delays due to weather conditions, traffic control problems and
breaches in security could harm the Company’s financial
condition and results of operations.



The Company’s business could be harmed if it is unable to attract and retain
qualified personnel at reasonable costs.

The Company’s business is labor intensive, with labor costs representing 37% of
Air Group’s operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002. The
Company expects salaries, wages and benefits to increase on a gross basis and
that these costs could increase as a percentage of its overall costs, which
could harm its business. The Company competes against the major U.S. airlines
for labor in many highly skilled positions. Many of the major U.S. airlines
offer wage and benefit packages that exceed the Company’s wage and benefit
packages. As a result, in the future, the Company may have to significantly
increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain qualified personnel
or risk considerable employee turnover. If the Company is unable to hire, train
and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost, it may be unable to grow
or sustain its business and its operating results and business prospects could
be harmed or if it loses the services of key personnel. The Company
may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel
who leave and, therefore, the loss of any of these individuals could
harm its business.



ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

Aircraft

The following table describes the aircraft operated and their average age at
December 31, 2002.

Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations,” discusses future orders and options for additional
aircraft.

Forty-six of the 54 aircraft owned by Alaska as of December 31, 2002 are subject
to liens securing long-term debt. Alaska’s leased 737-200C, 737-400, and MD-80
aircraft have lease expiration dates in 2003, between 2004 and 2016, and
between 2003 and 2013, respectively. Horizon’s leased Dash 8 and CRJ 700
aircraft have expiration dates between 2012 and 2018 and between 2018 and 2019,
respectively. As part of its fleet modernization plan, Horizon retired the
remaining F-28 aircraft on February 14, 2003. Alaska and Horizon have the
option to extend most of the leases for additional periods, or the right to
purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, usually at the then fair
market value of the aircraft. For information regarding obligations under
capital leases and long-term operating leases, see Note 5 to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2002, all of the Company’s aircraft met the Stage 3 noise
requirements under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990. However,
special noise ordinances restrict the timing of flights operated by Alaska and
other airlines at Burbank, Orange County, San Diego, San Jose and Palm Springs.
In addition,
Orange County, Reagan National and Long Beach airports restrict the type of
aircraft and number of flights.

Ground Facilities and Services

Alaska and Horizon lease ticket counters, gates, cargo and baggage, office
space, and other support areas at the majority of the airports they serve.
Alaska also owns terminal buildings at various Alaska cities.



Alaska has centralized operations in several buildings located at or near
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) in Seattle, Washington. The
owned buildings, including land unless located on leased airport property,
include a three-bay hangar facility with maintenance shops, a flight operations
and training center, an air cargo facility, a reservations and office facility,
several office buildings, its corporate headquarters, and two storage
warehouses. Alaska also leases a two-bay hangar/office facility at Sea-Tac.
Alaska’s other major facilities include a regional headquarters building, an
air cargo facility, and a leased hangar/office facility in Anchorage; a Phoenix
reservations center; and a leased two-bay maintenance facility in Oakland.

Horizon owns its Seattle corporate headquarters building. It leases an
operations, training, and aircraft maintenance facility in Portland, and
maintenance facilities in Boise, Pasco and Spokane.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Oakland Maintenance Investigation

In December 1998, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California
initiated a grand jury investigation concerning certain 1998 maintenance
activities at Alaska’s Oakland maintenance base. The investigation was expanded
to include the aircraft involved in the loss of Flight 261 in January 2000. The
FAA separately proposed a civil penalty in connection with the 1998 maintenance
activities, which Alaska and the FAA have settled for an agreed amount. In
December 2001, the U.S. Attorney notified Alaska that the evidence it had
gathered relative to the 1998 maintenance activities did not warrant the filing
of criminal charges, and closed that part of the investigation. The U.S.
Attorney also placed the portion of its investigation related to Flight 261 on
inactive status, with the possibility of reactivating and reviewing the matter
when the NTSB issued its final report on the accident. Accordingly, following
the final NTSB hearing on the Flight 261 investigation in December 2002, the
U.S. Attorney’s Office reactivated the matter in order to review it in light of
the final NTSB report.

Flight 261 Litigation

Alaska is a defendant in a number of lawsuits relating to the loss of Flight
261 on January 31, 2000. Representatives of all 88 passengers and crew on board
have filed cases against Alaska, the Boeing Company, and others. The
suits were originally filed in various state and federal courts in
Alaska, California, Washington and Illinois. Since then, they
have all been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California. The suits seek
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. In May 2001, the judge
presiding over the majority of the cases ruled that punitive damages are not
available against Alaska. Alaska has settled 48 of these cases and
continues in its efforts to settle the remaining ones. Trial on the
remaining cases is set for July 2003. Consistent with industry
standards, the Company maintains insurance against aircraft accidents.

Flight 261 NTSB
Proceeding

In January 2003, the NTSB issued its
final report on the Flight 261 accident. The report contained
the NTSB’s findings, conclusions, probable cause of the accident and
safety recommendations. NTSB staff’s draft report included
language that the Board recommend a new FAA inspection of Alaska due
to perceived deficiencies in recent maintenance practices. The Board
rejected that recommendation.



Management believes the ultimate disposition of the above matters is not likely
to materially affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
This forward-looking statement is based on management’s current understanding
of the relevant law and facts; it is subject to various contingencies,
including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the
actions of judges and juries.

The Company is also a party to other ordinary routine litigation incidental to
its business and with respect to which no material liability is expected.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial
statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. All statements in the following discussion which are not reports of
historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are
forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in
light of the risks referred to in this report’s introductory cautionary note.
There can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by
the Company. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a
result of a number of factors, some of which the Company cannot predict or
control. For a discussion of these factors, see Item 1 “Business Risks”.

Industry Conditions

The airline industry is cyclical. Generally speaking, economic conditions were
strong during 2000, but weakened during 2001 and 2002. Because the industry
has high fixed costs in relation to revenues, a small change in load factors or
fare levels has a large impact on profits. For most airlines, labor and fuel
account for almost half of operating expenses. The relatively strong economy
in the late 90s put upward pressure on labor costs. Fuel prices have been
volatile in the last three years. Fuel cost per gallon increased 54%
in 2000,
decreased 14% in 2001 and 10% in 2002.

On September 11, 2001, the United States was attacked by terrorists using
hijacked jets of two U.S. airlines. The FAA shut down all commercial airline
flight operations for September 11 and 12. Airlines resumed flight operations
at reduced levels on September 13. These events, combined with continued
slowing economic conditions in 2002, have had a significant negative impact on
demand for airline travel. Throughout the industry, airlines continue to cut
capacity and have instituted a variety of cost-saving measures. In addition,
credit rating agencies have downgraded the long-term credit ratings of most
U.S. airlines and their related entities, including Alaska Air Group, Inc. On
September 22, 2001, the U.S. Government passed the Air Transportation Safety
and System Stabilization Act (the Act) to provide $5 billion of cash
compensation and $10 billion of loan guarantees to U.S. airlines. The purpose
of the Act was to compensate the airlines for direct and incremental losses for
the period September 11 through December 31, 2001 as a result of the September
11 terrorist attacks. As of December 31, 2001, Alaska had recognized $71.6
million and Horizon had recognized $9.8 million of the $5 billion cash
compensation. During the third quarter of 2002, the United States Department
of Transportation (DOT) completed its review procedures and remitted final
compensation payments to Alaska and Horizon of $0.2 million and $0.2 million,
respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2002 Compared with 2001

The consolidated loss before accounting change for 2002 was $67.2 million, or
$2.53 per share compared with a loss of $43.4 million, or $1.64 per share in
2001. The consolidated operating loss was $88.9 million in 2002 compared with
an operating loss of $126.3 million in 2001. Consolidated results in 2001 and
2002 include $81.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of government



compensation recognized resulting from the Act. Consolidated results for 2002
include a $51.4 million charge in connection with write-off of all of the
Company’s goodwill (See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Financial and statistical data for Alaska and Horizon is shown in Item 6. A
discussion of this data follows.

Alaska Airlines Revenues

Operating revenue increased 3.7% during 2002 as compared to 2001. Available
seat miles (ASMs or Capacity) increased during each quarter of 2002 as compared
to 2001 due to the addition of service to five cities (Calgary, Boston, Denver,
Newark and Miami) and due to the negative impact of the terrorist attacks on
4th quarter 2001 capacity. For the full year 2002, capacity was up 8.0% while
revenue passenger miles (RPMs or traffic) increased at a slightly lower rate
(7.6%), resulting in a 0.3 point decrease in passenger load factor (RPMs
divided by ASMs). In our largest market, Southern California, capacity was
slightly higher in 2002 compared to 2001, and traffic was slightly lower,
resulting in a decrease in load factor of 1.1 points. Capacity and traffic
gains experienced in the last two quarters in this market were offset by
decreases in the first two quarters. In our second largest market,
Anchorage/Fairbanks to the U.S. mainland, both capacity and traffic increased
when compared to 2001; traffic increased at a higher rate than capacity,
resulting in a increase in load factor of 1.8 points for the year. The average
load factor for our newest five cities was better than the system average.

Yield per passenger mile was down in each quarter of the year: 5.0% in the
first quarter, 2.5% in the second quarter, 3.9% in the third quarter and 3.0%
in the fourth quarter. The decrease in passenger yield was due to a
combination of fewer business passengers, a drop off in demand due to the
events of September 11, fare sales offered to stimulate demand, and the sagging
economy. For the full year 2002, yields were down 3.6%. The higher traffic
combined with the lower yield resulted in a 3.7% increase in passenger revenue.

Freight and mail revenues decreased 7.8%. After September 11, new security
measures had a negative impact on our freight and mail volumes, resulting in a
negative impact on revenues.

Other-net revenues increased 20.7%, largely due to increased revenue from the
sale of miles in Alaska’s frequent flyer program, and redemption of miles on
partner airlines (Alaska recognizes revenue for the difference between the
funds received for the sale of miles to third parties and the cost of the award
redemptions on partner airlines).

Alaska Airlines Expenses

Excluding fuel, operating expenses grew by $85.5 million, or 5.5%, as a result
of an 8.0% increase in ASMs and a 2.4% decrease in cost per ASM. The cost per
ASM excluding fuel increased slightly by 0.2% during the first nine months of
2002 when compared to the same period in 2001 but decreased by 8.9% in the
fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of the terrorist attacks in 2001.
Explanations of significant year-over-year changes in the components of
operating expenses are as follows:

•

Wages and benefits increased 9.7% due to a 9.5% increase in average
wages and benefits per employee and a 0.3% increase in the number of
employees. The 2002 results include a full year of a pilot wage increase
which occurred in June 2001, step increases for union





Horizon Air Revenues

For the year 2002, capacity was up 13.0% and traffic was up 12.1%, resulting in
a 0.4 decrease in passenger load factor. Passenger yields were down 10.4% in
the first quarter, down 11.6% in the second quarter, down 7.0% in the third
quarter and down 3.7% in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in business
passengers and the economic downturn. For the full year 2002, yields were down
8.6%. The increased traffic combined with the lower yield resulted in a 2.5%
increase in passenger revenue.

Freight and mail revenues decreased 38.3%. In June 2001, Horizon ceased
carrying general freight in order to focus on carrying higher-yield small
packages instead. This change, along with the impact of the September 11
terrorist attacks, led to the decline in revenues. Other-net revenues
increased 2.0%, primarily due to manufacturer support received as compensation
for delays in delivery of CRJ 700 aircraft.

Horizon Air Expenses

Cost per ASM decreased 14.4% as a result of a 13.0% increase in ASMs
combined with a $13.1 million, or
3.3% decrease in operating expenses, excluding fuel and special
charge. Unit costs in 2001 were adversely impacted by the capacity
reductions that resulted from the September 11 terrorist attacks.
Additionally, Horizon’s expenses in 2001 were adversely impacted by the delay
in the delivery of the CRJ 700 aircraft from January 2001 to July 2001.
Explanations of significant year-over-year changes in the components of
operating expenses are as follows:



•

Landing fees and other rentals increased 3.3% due to higher landing
fee and rental rates at airports throughout the system. The higher rates
reflect the airports’ increased cost of operations due to new security
directives and expansion of their facilities.

•

Other expense increased 29.2%, primarily due to higher expenditures for
insurance. Subsequent to the events of September 11, the Company
experienced significant increases in hull, liability and war risk
insurance rates, and was also subject to surcharges for war risk
coverage. As a result of those increases, insurance expense for
aircraft for Horizon
in 2002 was $16.1 million, compared to $6.1 million in 2001.

•

The $10.2 million special charge in 2001 recognizes the loss in
value of owned Fokker F-28 aircraft and related spare parts. The
F-28s, which are being replaced with more fuel-efficient CRJ 700
regional jets, were completely taken out of service on February 14, 2003.
The remaining net book value of these aircraft and related spare parts
as of December 31, 2002, was $8.1 million.

Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense)

Net nonoperating loss was $12.9 million in 2002 compared to nonoperating income
of $62.8 million in 2001. The $75.7 million decrease was primarily due to U.S.
government compensation of $81.4 million recognized in 2001 compared to $0.5
million in 2002.

In 2001, Alaska and Horizon recognized $71.6 million and $9.8 million,
respectively of U.S. government compensation. During the third quarter of
2002, the DOT completed its review procedures and remitted final compensation
payments to Alaska and Horizon of $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest totaled $36.8 million in 2001
which compares to $43.6 million in 2002.

The Company has fuel hedge contracts that are carried on the balance sheet at
fair value. Each period, the contracts are measured and adjusted to fair
market value. The change in the value of the fuel hedge contracts that
perfectly offsets the change in the value of the aircraft fuel being hedged is
recorded as other comprehensive income/loss until the hedged contract is
settled and is then recognized in earnings. To the extent the change in the
value of the fuel hedge contracts does not perfectly offset the change in the
value of the aircraft fuel purchase being hedged, that portion of the hedge is
recognized in earnings. In 2001 and 2002, $7.4 million of expense and $6.4
million of income, respectively, was recorded as part of other nonoperating expense to
recognize the hedge ineffectiveness on the contracts. As detailed in Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2002, the Company has
fuel hedge contracts for 140 million gallons of projected jet fuel usage in
2003, which represents approximately 35% of projected usage.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”.
Under this Statement, the Company’s goodwill will no longer be amortized, but
instead will be tested for impairment on a minimum of an annual basis. During
the second quarter of 2002, the Company completed the first step of its
impairment test related to its $51.4 million of goodwill. The test was
performed using Alaska and Horizon as separate reporting units. In the fourth
quarter of 2002, the Company completed the



second step of its impairment test
and determined that all of the Company’s goodwill was impaired. As a result,
the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge, effective January 1, 2002, of
$51.4 million ($12.5 million Alaska and $38.9 million Horizon) to write-off all
of its goodwill. This charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting
change in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2002.

2001 Compared with 2000

The consolidated net loss for 2001 was $43.4 million, or $1.64 per share
compared with a loss before accounting change of $20.4 million, or $0.77 per
share in 2000. The consolidated operating loss was $126.3 million in 2001
compared with an operating loss of $33.1 million in 2000. The larger operating
loss was primarily due to the weakening economy, partially offset by a decrease
in fuel costs, and also due to the negative impact of the terrorist attacks,
for which the Company has been partially compensated by the U.S. government.

Alaska Airlines Revenues

Capacity increased 6.7% during the first nine months of 2001 due to normal
growth, but decreased 5.9% in the fourth quarter due to the impact of the
terrorist attacks. Alaska operated approximately 87% of its previously planned
schedule in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2001, capacity was up 3.5%
but traffic grew by only 2.2%, resulting in a 0.8 point decrease in passenger
load factor. In our largest market, Southern California, capacity was slightly
lower in 2001 compared to 2000, resulting in flat traffic and a slight increase
in load factor (0.2 points). Capacity and traffic gains experienced in the
second quarter in this market were offset by decreases in the fourth quarter.
In our second largest market, Anchorage/Fairbanks to the U.S. mainland,
capacity increased in the upper-single digits, but traffic increases were not
as high, resulting in a decrease in load factor of 2.3 points for the year. Our
newest market, Seattle to Washington D.C., which operated primarily in the
fourth quarter, had an average load factor for the fourth quarter that was
better than the system average.

Passenger yields were up 2.8% in the first quarter due to fuel-related fare
increases implemented in late 2000. In the second and third quarters, yield
was down 2.4% and 5.7%, respectively, due to a decline in business passengers
and fare sales. Yields were down 7.0% in the fourth quarter due to a
combination of fewer business passengers, a drop off in demand due to the
events of September 11, and fares sales offered to stimulate demand. For the
full year 2001, yields were down 3.2%. The higher traffic combined with the
lower yield resulted in a 1.1% decrease in passenger revenue.

Freight and mail revenues, which were also adversely impacted by the September
11 terrorist attacks, increased 2.4%. Prior to September 11, freight revenues
were flat compared to 2000, but mail revenues had increased compared to 2000
due to higher yields. Volumes of mail shipped were lower than in 2000, but the
rate increases instituted in early 2001 resulted in higher revenues. After
September 11, two security measures impacted our freight and mail business:
first, the limitation on carrying mail greater than 16 ounces on flights with
60 or more passengers limited our ability to carry mail from Alaska to the U.S.
mainland. Second, we may only carry freight from known shippers, which
negatively impacted our freight volumes. The effects of these two measures
will have a slightly negative impact on revenues in the future.



Other-net revenues increased 19.9%, largely due to increased revenue from the
sale of miles in Alaska’s frequent flyer program.

Alaska Airlines Expenses

Excluding fuel, operating expenses grew by $85.7 million, or 5.8%, as a result
of a 3.5% increase in ASMs and a 2.3% increase in cost per ASM. The cost per
ASM excluding fuel remained constant during the first nine months of 2001 when
compared to the same period in 2000 but increased by 10.1% in the fourth
quarter, primarily due to the impact of the terrorist attacks and labor costs.
Explanations of significant year-over-year changes in the components of
operating expenses are as follows:



the estimated costs Alaska
incurs to acquire awards on other airlines for its Mileage Plan
members, as well as lower assumed forfeiture miles.

•

Depreciation and amortization increased 23.7%, primarily due to
the addition of eight owned aircraft during 2001.

•

Landing fees and other rentals increased 33.7%, exceeding the
2.5% increase in landings, due to higher landing fee and rental rates
at airports throughout the system. The higher rates reflect the
airports’ increased cost of operations due to new security directives,
expansion of their facilities, and increased costs for utilities. Due
to the events of September 11, airports are experiencing fewer
landings and lower receipts from concessionaires. Therefore, the
Company anticipates that these revenue shortfalls will be passed
through to airlines via increased landing fees and terminal rents. In
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company expensed $5.1 million for
estimated shortfalls related to 2001.

•

Other expense increased 2.4%, primarily due to higher
expenditures for insurance, flight crew hotels and utilities, partly
offset by lower recruiting, passenger remuneration, and legal costs.
Subsequent to the events of September 11, the Company experienced
significant increases in hull, liability and war risk insurance rates,
and was also subject to surcharges for war risk coverage.

Horizon Air Revenues

Capacity was essentially flat during the first eight months of 2001, but
decreased 26.3% in September and 16.1% in the fourth quarter due to the impact
of the terrorist attacks. Horizon operated approximately 80% of its previously
planned schedule in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2001, capacity was
down 6.6% and traffic was down 5.5%, resulting in a 0.7 point increase in
passenger load factor. Passenger yields were down 1.3% in the first quarter,
down 4.6% in the second quarter, and down 8.2% in the third quarter due to a
reduction in business passengers, and down 9.4% in the fourth quarter due to a
combination of fewer business passengers and lower fares. For the full year
2001, yields were down 5.6%. The lower traffic combined with the lower yield
resulted in a 10.8% decrease in passenger revenue.

Freight and mail revenues decreased 27.7%. In June 2001, Horizon ceased
carrying general freight in order to focus on carrying higher-yield small
packages instead. This change, along with the impact of the September 11
terrorist attacks, led to the decline in revenues. Other-net revenues
increased $14.2 million, primarily due to manufacturer support received as
compensation for delays in delivery of CRJ 700 aircraft.

Horizon Air Expenses

Cost per ASM increased 12.1% as a result of a 6.6% decrease in ASMs
and an $18.1 million, or 4.8% increase in operating expenses,
excluding fuel and special charge. Unit costs were adversely impacted by the capacity
reductions that resulted from the September 11 terrorist attacks.
Additionally, Horizon’s expenses were adversely impacted by the delay in the
delivery of the CRJ 700 aircraft from January 2001 to July 2001. The Company
hired and trained pilots, flight attendants and mechanics, and purchased spare
parts in anticipation of the new fleet delivery,



which was to commence in
January. Those preparations increased expenses from the beginning of the year,
but the total expected benefits of the new and more efficient aircraft occurred
much later in the year due to the delay. Explanations of significant
year-over-year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows:



Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense)

Net nonoperating income was $62.8 million in 2001 compared to $6.2 million in
2000. The $56.6 million increase was primarily due to U.S. government
compensation, partially offset by interest expense.

In 2001, Alaska and Horizon recognized $71.6 million and $9.8 million,
respectively of U.S. government compensation, under the Air Transportation Safety and System
Stabilization Act described above under Industry Conditions. During the third
quarter of 2002, the DOT completed its review procedures and remitted final
compensation payments to Alaska and Horizon of $0.2 million and $0.2 million,
respectively. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased $18.5
million due to new debt incurred during the year ended December 31, 2001.

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities”, as amended. The cumulative effect of adoption of SFAS No.
133 was not material to the Company’s financial position or results of
operations. SFAS No. 133 requires companies to record derivatives on the
balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. The Company
has fuel hedge contracts that are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.
Each period, the contracts are measured and adjusted to fair market value. The
change in the value of the fuel hedge contracts that perfectly offsets the
change in the value of the aircraft fuel purchase being hedged is recorded as
comprehensive income/loss until the hedged contract is settled and is then
recognized in earnings. To the extent the change in the value of the fuel
hedge contracts does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the
aircraft fuel purchase being hedged, that portion of the hedge is recognized in
earnings. In 2001, $7.4 million of charges were recorded as part of other
nonoperating expense to recognize the hedge ineffectiveness on the fuel
contracts.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has three critical accounting policies that require a more
significant amount of management judgment than other accounting policies the
Company employs. They are described below.

Mileage Plan

The Company has a loyalty program that awards miles to passengers who fly on
Alaska or Horizon and our travel partners. Additionally, the Company sells
miles to third parties, such as our credit card partner, for cash. In either
case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on Alaska, Horizon, or
any of our alliance partners. The Company has an obligation to provide this
future travel; therefore, for awards to passengers who fly on Alaska, Horizon
or our travel partners, the Company recognizes a liability and the
corresponding expense for this future obligation. For miles sold to third
parties, the sales proceeds related to future travel are recorded as deferred
revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had 72 billion miles outstanding,
representing a liability of $303 million. The liability is computed based on
several assumptions that require management judgment to estimate and formulate.
There are uncertainties inherent in estimates; therefore, an incorrect
assumption impacts the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or
Mileage Plan



expenses. The most significant
assumptions in accounting for the
Mileage Plan are described below.

1.

The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel and the miles used
per award (i.e. free ticket):

Outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel. Members may not
reach the threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles
may not always be redeemed for travel. Therefore, based on the
number of Mileage Plan accounts and the miles in the accounts, the Company
estimates how many miles will never be used, and does not record a liability
for those miles. We also estimate how many miles will be used per award. If
actual miles used are more or less than estimated, we may need to adjust the
liability and corresponding expense.

2.

The costs which will be incurred to carry the passenger:

When the frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket, incremental costs
such as food, fuel and insurance, are incurred by the Company to carry that
passenger. The Company estimates what these costs will be and accrues a
liability. If the passenger travels on another airline, the Company often
must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline
costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often higher than the costs
incurred by the Company to carry that passenger. The Company estimates how
much it will pay to other airlines for future travel awards and accrues this
expense. When the award is flown, if the costs actually incurred by the
Company or paid to other airlines are higher or lower than the costs that
were estimated and accrued, the liability may be under or overstated.

3.

Redemption on Alaska or Horizon versus other airlines:

The cost for Alaska or Horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower
than the cost the Company will pay to other airlines. The Company estimates the number
of awards which will be redeemed on Alaska or Horizon versus other airlines
and accrues the costs based on this estimate. If the number of awards
redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated, the liability
may be under or overstated.

The Company reviews all Mileage Plan estimates each quarter, and changes
certain assumptions based on historical trends. In 2000, the Company
recorded a charge of $40.2 million primarily due to a change in
estimate for the cost of travel awards earned by mileage plan members
flying on travel partners and an increase in the number of awards
that will ultimately be redeemed for travel.

Pension Plans

The Company accounts for the defined benefit pension plans using Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employer’s Accounting for Pensions (SFAS
87). Under SFAS 87, pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over
employees’ approximate service periods. Pension expense calculated under SFAS
87 is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. The Company
recognized expense for its defined benefit pension plans of $13.5 million,
$20.0 million and $40.0 million in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires
the use of a number of critical assumptions, including the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these
assumptions can result in different expense and liability



amounts, and future
actual experience can differ from these assumptions. At December 31, 2002, the
fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets totaled $418.1 million. Lower
investment returns, benefit payments and declining discount rates have resulted
in a charge in the fourth quarter of $87.2 million (net of tax of $52.5 million) as of
December 31, 2002. The Company anticipates making a cash contribution of
approximately $38.0 million during 2003.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets
decreases. At December 31, 2002, the Company estimates that the pension plan
assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 8.0%. This rate is lower
than the assumed rate of 10.0% used at both December 31, 2000 and 2001 and was
developed by evaluating input from consultants and economists as well as
long-term inflation assumptions. The Company regularly reviews the actual
asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments as considered
appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December
31, 2002 is based on an allocation of U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income
securities. Decreasing the expected long-term rate of return by 0.5% (from
8.0% to 7.5%) would increase the Company’s estimated 2003 pension expense by
approximately $2.2 million.

Pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is
reduced. The Company discounted future pension obligations using a rate of
7.50%, 7.25% and 6.75% at December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. The
discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality
long-term bonds. Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5% (from 6.75% to 6.25%)
would increase the Company’s accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2002 by
approximately $35.2 million and increase the estimated 2003 pension expense
by approximately $6.4 million.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other
factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact the
Company’s future pension expense and liabilities. The Company cannot predict
with certainty what these factors will be in the future.

Long-lived Assets

In accounting for long-lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the
expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the
assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets
and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment
include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of
the long-lived assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition,
and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset.
Due to the events of September 11 and the impact on the airline industry, in
2001 the Company evaluated whether the book value of its aircraft was impaired
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS
No. 121), “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of”. The Company performed an impairment
test, as required by SFAS No. 121, which was based on the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the Company’s aircraft. Based on
this test, the Company determined that the Horizon Fokker F-28 fleet was
impaired, and a write-down of $10.2 million was taken against the book value of
those aircraft and related spare parts.



In 2002, due to the sagging economy and its impact on the airline industry, the
Company evaluated whether the book value of its aircraft was impaired in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets” (This statement supercedes SFAS No. 121). No impairment was
necessary based on the results of the evaluation.

There is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the
impairment test. If cash flows do not materialize as estimated, there is a
risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate, or further
impairment charges may be necessary in the future.

The Company has various options
available to meet its capital and operating commitments in 2003,
including cash on hand at December 31, 2002 of
$635.8 million and internally generated funds from operations.
In addition, to supplement cash requirements, the Company
periodically considers various borrowing or leasing options. The
Company believes current cash resources will enable the Company to
fund operations through 2003.

2002 Financial Changes

Net cash provided by operating activities was $124.5 million in 2002, compared
to $286.5 million in 2001. The decrease in 2002 is partially due to $79.9
million of U. S. government cash compensation received in 2001. Additional
cash in 2002 was provided by the issuance of $58.0 million of new debt. The
Company used cash generated from operations and the Alaska
Airlines’ issuance of the $58.0
million of debt to purchase $154.4 million of capital equipment, including one
new Boeing 737 aircraft, spare parts and airframe and engine overhauls. Cash
was also used to repay $43.8 million of debt.

Shareholders’ equity decreased
$195.6 million due principally to the loss before accounting
change of
$67.2 million, the cumulative effect of an accounting change
related to goodwill of $51.4 million (see Note 15 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements), and a non-cash charge to equity of $87.2
million, net of tax, in connection with the defined benefit plans
that the



Company sponsors for eligible employees (See Note 7 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).

2001 Financial Changes

The Company’s cash and marketable securities portfolio increased by $201
million during 2001. Operating activities provided $286 million of cash in
2001. Additional cash was provided by the issuance of new debt ($388.8
million). Cash was used for $390 million of capital expenditures, including
the purchase of eight new and one used Boeing 737 aircraft, spare parts and
engine overhauls, and for $69 million of debt repayment.

2000 Financial Changes

The Company’s cash and marketable securities portfolio increased by $131
million during 2000. Operating activities provided $273 million of cash in
2000. Additional cash was provided by the issuance of new debt ($238 million)
and insurance proceeds from an aircraft accident ($37 million). Cash was used
for $354 million of capital expenditures, including the purchase of seven new
Boeing 737 aircraft, flight equipment deposits and airframe and engine
overhauls, and for $66 million of debt repayment.

Financing Activities

- During 2002, Alaska issued $58 million of debt secured
by flight equipment. This debt was issued with varying interest rates based on
LIBOR and payment terms of 12 years.

Additionally, during 2002, Horizon added three Dash 8-400 and seven CRJ 700
aircraft to its operating fleet. The aircraft were financed with a combination
of U.S. leveraged leases and single investor leases with terms of ten
to 16 years.
The aggregate future minimum lease payments under these ten new operating
leases will be $235.4 million.

Commitments

- At December 31, 2002, Alaska and Horizon had firm orders for 28
aircraft requiring aggregate payments of approximately $601 million. In
addition, Alaska has options to acquire 26 more B737s, and Horizon has options
to acquire 15 Dash 8-400s and 25 CRJ 700s. Alaska expects to finance its new
aircraft with leases, long-term debt, or internally generated cash. Horizon
expects to finance its new aircraft with operating leases. As previously
mentioned, as a result of the events of September 11, credit rating agencies
downgraded the long-term credit ratings of most U.S. airlines and their related
entities. The events of September 11 combined with the sagging economy and its
affect on the airline industry have had a negative impact on the availability
of credit to the Company. We anticipate that it will be more difficult to
obtain credit in the future, and it will be at higher rates with more
collateral requirements than in the past.

Alaska is party to a purchase agreement with an aircraft manufacturer. Under
the agreement, upon commitment to purchase the aircraft, Alaska must make
deposits to the manufacturer for a portion of the purchase price of the
aircraft, with the remainder of the purchase price due at delivery. Concurrent
with this agreement, the manufacturer has an agreement with a Trust wherein the
Trust makes deposits to the manufacturer of additional pre-delivery deposits
for the aircraft. Under certain specified events, including default by the
Trust, Alaska may be required to pay the manufacturer the amounts paid by the
Trust in order to retain the right to purchase the aircraft. Alaska makes
monthly payments to the Trust related to the advances made by the Trust to the
manufacturer, which payments are capitalized as part of the aircraft cost. The
Trust is reimbursed for its advances on or before the delivery of the
applicable aircraft.

New Accounting Standards

- In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations”, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The statement also requires that
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset. This statement is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2003. The
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections”
(“Statement 145”). This Statement requires that only certain debt
extinguishment transactions be classified as an extraordinary item.
Additionally, under this Statement, capital leases that are modified so that
the resulting agreement is an operating lease, shall be accounted for under the
sale-leaseback provisions of SFAS No. 98. Statement 145 also includes minor
modifications to existing U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
literature. Statement 145 is generally effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The adoption of this
statement did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities”. This Statement addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)”. This Statement requires that a liability
for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred. The Statement is effective for the Company on January
1, 2003 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”. This Interpretation elaborates on the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees. Additionally, this
Interpretation clarifies the requirements for recognizing a liability at the
inception of the guarantee equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken
in issuing the guarantee and



incorporates the guidance in FASB Interpretation
No. 34, Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.
Disclosures under Interpretation No. 45 are effective for financial statements
issued after December 15, 2002. While the Company has various guarantees
included in contracts in the normal course of business, primarily in the form
of indemnities, these guarantees would only result in immaterial increases in
future costs, but do not represent significant commitments or contingent
liabilities of the indebtedness of others.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” which requires the consolidation of variable
interest entities, as defined. This Interpretation is effective for the
Company on January 1, 2003 and is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure”. SFAS No. 148 amends the transition
and disclosure provisions in SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS No. 148 to determine
if it will adopt SFAS No. 123 to account for employee stock options using the
fair value method and, if so, when to transition to that method.

Effect of Inflation

- Inflation and specific price changes do not have a
significant effect on the Company’s operating revenues, operating expenses and
operating income.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes. The Company has significant commodity price risk exposure to
jet fuel price increases. Currently, a one-cent change in the fuel price per
gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately $3.8 million. To help manage
this exposure, the Company began purchasing hedge instruments, primarily crude oil
swap agreements during 2000. Ineffectiveness of contracts resulted in nonoperating
expense of $7.4 million for 2001 and nonoperating income of $6.4 million for
2002. At December 31, 2002, the Company had swap agreements for crude oil
contracts in place to hedge approximately 35% of its 2003 expected jet fuel
requirements. In 2002, these contracts had unrealized gains, net
of tax of $10.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in jet fuel prices would
increase 2003 fuel expense by approximately $26.1 million. A hypothetical 10%
decrease in jet fuel prices would decrease 2003 fuel expense by approximately
$26.2 million. This analysis includes the effect of the fuel hedging contracts
in place at December 31, 2002. A hypothetical 10% change in the average
interest rates incurred on variable rate debt during 2002 would correspondingly
change the Company’s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by
approximately $2.8 million.

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

December 31, 2002

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alaska Air Group,
Inc. (Company or Air Group) and its subsidiaries, the principal subsidiaries
being Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.
(Horizon). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
their preparation requires the use of management’s estimates. Actual results
could differ from these estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made in
prior years’ financial statements to conform to the 2002 presentation.

Nature of Operations

Alaska and Horizon operate as airlines. However, their business plans,
competition, and economic risks differ substantially. Alaska is a major
airline serving primarily Alaska; Vancouver, Canada; the U.S. West Coast; and
Mexico. It operates an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is 932
miles. Horizon is a regional airline serving primarily the Pacific Northwest,
Northern California, and Western Canada. It operates both jet and turboprop
aircraft, and its average passenger trip is 314 miles. Substantially all of
Alaska’s and Horizon’s sales occur in the United States. See Note 11 for
operating segment information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less. They are carried at cost, which approximates market.
The Company reduces its cash balance when checks are disbursed. Due to the
time delay in checks clearing the banks, the Company normally maintains a
negative cash balance, which is reported as a current liability. The amount of
the negative cash balance was $19.8 million and $27.5 million at December 31,
2001 and 2002, respectively.

Inventories and Supplies – net

Expendable and repairable aircraft parts, as well as other materials and
supplies, are stated at average cost. An allowance for obsolescence of flight
equipment expendable and repairable parts is accrued based on estimated
disposal dates and salvage values. Surplus inventories are carried at their
net realizable value. At December 31, 2001 and 2002, the allowance for all
inventories was $39.6 million and $44.5 million, respectively.

Property, Equipment and Depreciation

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which are as follows:

Aircraft and related flight equipment:

Boeing 737-200C

10-14 years

Boeing 737-400/700/900

20 years

Boeing MD-80

20 years

Bombardier Dash 8 (Rotable spares only)

10 years

Bombardier CRJ 700 (Rotable spares only)

10 years

Fokker F-28

2/14/03*

Buildings

10-30 years

Capitalized leases and
leasehold improvements

Term of lease

Other equipment

3-15 years

*

Final aircraft retirement date

Routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. The costs of major
airframe and engine overhauls are capitalized and amortized to maintenance



expense over the shorter of the life
of the overhaul or the remaining lease term. Major modifications that extend
the life or improve the usefulness of aircraft are capitalized and depreciated
over their estimated period of use. Assets and related obligations for items
financed under capital leases are initially recorded at an amount equal to the
present value of the future minimum lease payments. The Company reviews
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the total amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are
less than its carrying amount. If the asset is not considered recoverable, an
amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value will be
charged against the asset with a corresponding expense to the consolidated
statement of operations.

Internally Developed Software

The Company capitalizes certain internal development software costs.
Amortization commences when the software is ready for its intended use and the
amortization period is the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalized
costs primarily include contract labor and the salaries and wages of
individuals dedicated to the development of internal use software. The Company
capitalized software development costs of $6.1 million, $9.2 million and $6.9
million during the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively.

Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue results primarily from the sale of mileage credits, the sale
and leaseback of aircraft, and the receipt of manufacturer or vendor credits.
This revenue is recognized when award transportation is provided or over the
term of the applicable agreements.

Leased Aircraft Return Costs

Cash payments associated with returning leased aircraft are accrued when
probable and estimable. As leased aircraft are returned, any payments are
charged against the established reserve. The reserve is part of other current
and long-term liabilities, and at December 31, 2001 and 2002 was $11.6 million
and $14.2 million, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Passenger revenue is recognized when the passenger travels. Tickets sold but
not yet used are reported as air traffic liability. Freight and mail revenues
are recognized when service is provided. Other-net revenues are primarily
related to the Mileage Plan and they are recognized as described in the
“Frequent Flyer Awards” paragraph below.

Frequent Flyer Awards

Alaska operates a frequent flyer program (“Mileage Plan”) that provides travel
awards to members based on accumulated mileage. For miles earned by flying on
Alaska and travel partners, the estimated incremental cost of providing free
travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as
miles are accumulated. Alaska also sells mileage credits to non-airline
partners, such as hotels, car rental agencies, and a credit card company. The
Company defers a majority of the sales proceeds and recognizes them as revenue
when the award transportation is provided. The deferred proceeds are
recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued on Alaska, and as other-net
revenue for awards issued on other airlines.

advertising, and promotional costs. Advertising production costs are expensed
the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense was $19.7
million, $17.1 million, and $17.0 million, respectively, in 2000, 2001, and
2002.

Capitalized Interest

Interest is capitalized on flight equipment purchase deposits and ground
facility progress payments as a cost of the related asset. The interest cost
is based on the Company’s weighted average borrowing rate and is depreciated
over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company ceases capitalization
of interest on aircraft when delivery dates are deferred. Capitalization
continues when the deferral period is over.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting
income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the
enactment date.

Stock Options

The Company applies the intrinsic value method in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees”, and related Interpretations in accounting for stock
options. See Note 6 for more information.

Had compensation cost for the Company’s stock options been
determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, loss before accounting change and applicable loss per share (EPS) would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below. See
Note 6 for the assumptions used to compute the pro forma amounts.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement on Financial
Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” as amended.



SFAS No. 133 requires companies to record
derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair
value. The Company’s operating results can be significantly impacted by
changes in the price of aircraft fuel. To manage the risks associated with
changes in aircraft fuel prices, the Company uses swap agreements and call
options for crude oil and other commodities. These contracts, referred to as
“fuel hedge contracts,” have a high correlation to changes in aircraft fuel
prices, and therefore qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. Each
period, the contracts are adjusted to fair market value. The change in the
value of the fuel hedge contracts that perfectly offsets the change in the
value of the aircraft fuel being hedged is recorded as other comprehensive
income or loss until the hedged contract is
settled and is then recognized in earnings as part of fuel expense.
To the extent the change in the value of the
fuel hedge contracts does not perfectly offset the change in the
value of the aircraft fuel purchase being hedged, the change is recognized in
earnings as part of nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2002, the Company has fuel
hedge contracts for 140 million gallons of jet fuel usage in 2003.

For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, the Company recognized $7.4
million in nonoperating expense and $6.4 million in nonoperating income,
respectively, related to the ineffectiveness on the fuel hedge
contracts. In 2001 and 2002, the Company recorded unrealized losses of $1.2
million and unrealized gains of $10.1 million, respectively, net of income taxes
which are reflected in other comprehensive income. During 2000 and 2002, the
Company recognized gains of $4.7 million and $12.1 million,
respectively, from
the cash settlement of hedging activities. In 2001, hedging gains resulting
from cash settlements of hedging activities were de minimis. These
gains are
reflected in aircraft fuel in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, generally with
maturities of less than one month, to manage the risk associated with net
foreign currency transactions. Resulting gains and losses are recognized
currently in other operating expense. The Company periodically enters into
interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate risk. At December 31,
2002, there were no foreign currency contracts or interest rate swap agreements
outstanding.

New Accounting Standards

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”. This Interpretation elaborates on the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees. Additionally, this
Interpretation clarifies the requirements for recognizing a liability at the
inception of the guarantee equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken
in issuing the guarantee and incorporates the guidance in FASB Interpretation
No. 34, Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.
Disclosures under Interpretation No. 45 are effective for financial statements
issued after December 15, 2002. While the Company has various guarantees
included in contracts in the normal course of business, primarily in the form
of indemnities, these guarantees would only result in immaterial increases in
future costs, but do not represent significant commitments or contingent
liabilities of the indebtedness of others.



Note 2.

Marketable Securities

At December 31, 2001 and 2002 all of the Company’s marketable securities are
classified as available-for-sale. The securities are carried at fair value,
with the unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity under the
caption “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)”. Realized gains and
losses are included in other nonoperating income (expense) in the consolidated
statements of operations. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as
available-for-sale are included in interest income in the consolidated
statements of operations.

Marketable securities consisted of the following at
December 31 (in millions):

Of the marketable securities on hand at December 31, 2002, 29% are expected to

equipment and real property. During 2002, Alaska issued $58.0 million of debt
secured by flight equipment, having interest rates that vary with LIBOR and
payment terms of 12 years. In September 2001, Alaska borrowed $150 million
under its credit facility at an interest

Aircraft Commitments

The Company has firm orders for nine Boeing 737 series aircraft to be delivered
between 2003 and 2004, and 14 Bombardier CRJ 700 jets between 2003 and 2005.
The firm orders require payments of approximately $601 million between 2003 and
2005. As of December 31, 2002, deposits of $83.9 million related to the firm
orders had been made. In addition to the ordered aircraft, the Company holds
purchase options on 26 Boeing 737s, 15 Dash 8-400s, and 25 CRJ 700s.

Alaska is party to a purchase agreement with an aircraft manufacturer. Under
the agreement, upon commitment to purchase the aircraft, Alaska must make
deposits to the manufacturer of a portion of the purchase price of the
aircraft, with the remainder of the purchase price due at delivery. Concurrent
with this agreement, the manufacturer has an agreement with a Trust wherein the
Trust makes deposits to the manufacturer of additional pre-delivery deposits
for the aircraft. Under certain specified events, including default by the
Trust, Alaska may be required to pay the manufacturer the amounts paid by the
Trust in order to retain the right to purchase the aircraft. Alaska makes
monthly payments to the Trust related to the advances made by the Trust to the
manufacturer, which payments are capitalized as part of the aircraft cost. The
Trust is reimbursed for its advances on or before the delivery of the
applicable aircraft.

Note 6.

Stock Plans

Air Group has three stock option plans that provide for the purchase of Air
Group common stock at stipulated prices on the dates of the grant by certain
officers and key employees of Air Group and its subsidiaries. Under the 1996,
1997, and 1999 Plans, options for 3,583,100 shares have been granted and, at
December 31, 2002, 981,650 shares were



available for grant. Under all plans,
the stock options granted have terms of up to ten years. Substantially all
grantees are 25% vested after one year, 50% after two years, 75% after three
years, and 100% after four years.

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions
used for grants in 2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively: dividend yield of 0% for
all years; volatility of 44%,
44%, and 49%; risk-free interest rates of 6.62%, 4.26%, and 3.82%; and expected
lives of 5 years for all years. Using these assumptions, the weighted average
fair value of options granted was $14.58, $12.71, and $13.43 in 2000, 2001, and
2002, respectively.

Air Group follows APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in accounting
for stock options. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for
these plans as the exercise price of options equals the fair market value on
date of grant.

Changes in the number of shares subject to option, with their weighted average
exercise prices, are summarized below:

The following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at
December 31, 2002 with their weighted average exercise prices and remaining
contractual lives:

In August 2002, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP
Plan) which is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue
Code. Under the terms of the ESPP Plan, employees can purchase Company common
stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day
of each quarterly offering period. Proceeds received from the issuance of
shares are credited to stockholders’ equity in the fiscal year the shares are
issued. Through December 31, 2002, 24,157 shares have been purchased by
Company employees under the ESPP Plan.

Note 7.

Employee Benefit Plans

Pension Plans

Four defined benefit and five defined contribution retirement plans cover
various employee groups of Alaska and Horizon. The defined benefit plans
provide benefits based on an employee’s term of service and average
compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. Pension plans
are funded as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA). The defined benefit plan assets consist primarily of marketable
equity and fixed income securities. The following table



sets forth the status
of the plans for 2001 and 2002 (in millions):

In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded an $87.2 million (net of
taxes of $52.5 million) non-cash charge to equity in connection with the
defined benefit plans that the Company sponsors for eligible employees. This
charge is a result of an unfunded accrued benefit obligation resulting from
lower than expected returns on plan assets and a reduction in
discount rate.

Alaska and Horizon also maintain unfunded, noncontributory defined benefit
plans for certain elected officers. The following table sets forth the status

contributions. Total expense for the defined contribution plans was $16.4
million, $19.0 million, and $20.6 million, respectively, in 2000, 2001, and
2002.

Profit Sharing Plans

Alaska and Horizon have employee profit sharing plans. There was no expense
during 2000, 2001 and 2002.

Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company allows retirees to continue their medical, dental, and vision
benefits by paying all or a portion of the active employee plan premium until
eligible for Medicare, currently age 65. This results in a subsidy to
retirees, because the premiums received by the Company are less than the actual
cost of the retirees’ claims. The accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) for this subsidy is unfunded, and at December 31, 2001 and
2002 was $32.6 million and $52.7 million, respectively. The accrued liability
related to the subsidy is included with other liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet, and totaled $29.4 million and $31.3 million at December 31, 2001
and 2002, respectively. Annual expense related to this subsidy was
approximately $4.6 million in 2000 and 2001, and $4.4 million in 2002.

based on commodity exchange prices. The fair value of restricted deposit
approximates the carrying amount. At December 31, 2001, the fair value of
restricted deposits include depository certificates



convertible into the common stock of
Equant N.V., which were valued at $1.4 million based on the market value of
France Telecom stock. In April 2002, the Company sold the certificates for net
sales proceeds of approximately $.9 million. The fair value of long-term debt
is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using the Company’s current
borrowing rate.

Note 10.           Loss per Share (EPS)

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the average number of common
shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the
average common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would have
been outstanding assuming the exercise of in-the-money stock options. Stock
options excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because they are
antidilutive, represented 1.8 million, 2.9 million, and 3.3 million shares,

Note 11.           Operating Segment Information

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information”, as amended (SFAS 131), requires that a public company report
annual and interim financial and descriptive information about its reportable
operating segments. Operating segments, as defined, are components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company has two primary
operating and reporting segments, consisting of Alaska and Horizon. These
segments are more fully described in Note 1 under Nature of Operations.

Financial information for Alaska and Horizon follows (in millions):

*  Capital expenditures include aircraft deposits and deposits returned.

Special Charge

In December 2001,Horizon recorded a
$10.2 million special charge to recognize  the loss in value of its owned Fokker F-28 aircraft engines and related spare
parts, which had a net book value of $16.2 million, net of the impairment
charge, at December 31, 2001, and $8.1 million at December 31, 2002. The
F-28s, which are being replaced with more fuel-efficient CRJ 700 regional jets,
were phased completely out of service on February 14,
2003.

Note 13.

U.S. Government Compensation

In September, 2001, the U.S. Government passed the Air Transportation Safety
and System Stabilization Act to provide $5 billion of cash compensation and $10
billion of loan guarantees to U.S. airlines. The purpose of the Act was to
compensate the airlines for direct and incremental losses for the period
September 11 through December 31, 2001 as a result of the September 11
terrorist attacks.

Through December 31, 2001, Alaska and Horizon recorded government compensation
of $71.6 million and $9.8 million, respectively. These amounts are reflected
in nonoperating income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.
During the third quarter of 2002, the Department of Transportation completed
its review procedures and remitted final compensation payments to Alaska and
Horizon of $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

Note 14.

Contingencies

Oakland Maintenance Investigation

In December 1998, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California
initiated a grand jury investigation concerning certain 1998 maintenance
activities at Alaska’s Oakland maintenance base. The investigation was expanded
to include the aircraft involved in the loss of Flight 261 in January 2000. The
FAA separately proposed a civil penalty in connection with the 1998 maintenance
activities, which Alaska and the FAA have settled for an agreed amount. In
December 2001, the U.S. Attorney notified Alaska that the evidence it had
gathered relative to the 1998 maintenance activities did not warrant the filing
of criminal charges, and closed that part of the investigation. The U.S.
Attorney also placed the portion of its investigation related to Flight 261 on
inactive status, with the possibility of reactivating and reviewing the matter
when the NTSB issued its final report on the accident. Accordingly, following
the final NTSB hearing on the Flight 261 investigation in December 2002, the
U.S. attorney’s office reactivated the matter in order to review it in light of
the final NTSB report.

Flight 261 Litigation

Alaska is a defendant in a number of lawsuits relating to the loss of Flight
261 on January 31, 2000. Representatives of all 88 passengers and crew on board
have filed cases against Alaska, the Boeing Company, and others. The
suits were originally filed in various state and Federal Courts in
Alaska, California, Washington and Illinois. Since then, they
have all been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California. The suits seek
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. In May 2001, the judge presiding
over the majority of the cases ruled that punitive damages are not available
against Alaska. Alaska has settled 48 of these cases and continues in
its efforts to settle the remaining ones. Trial on the remaining
cases is set for July 2003. Consistent with industry standards,
the Company maintains insurance against aircraft accidents.

Flight 261 NTSB Proceeding

In January 2003, the NTSB issued its final report on the Flight 261
accident. The report contained the NTSB’s findings, conclusions,
probable cause of the accident and safety recommendations. NTSB
staff’s draft report included language that the Board recommend
a new FAA inspection of Alaska due to perceived deficiencies in
recent maintenance practices. The Board rejected that recommendation.

Management believes the ultimate disposition of the above matters is not likely
to materially affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
This forward-looking statement is based on management’s current understanding
of the relevant law and facts; it is subject to various contingencies,
including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the
actions of judges and juries.

The Company is also a party to other ordinary routine litigation incidental to
its business and with respect to which no material liability is expected.



Note 15.

Change in Accounting Principles

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin 101 (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
SAB 101 gives specific guidance on the conditions that must be met before
revenue may be recognized, and in 2000 Alaska changed its method of
accounting for the sale of miles in its Mileage Plan. Under the new method, a
majority of the sales proceeds is deferred, then recognized ratably over the
estimated period of time that the award transportation is provided. The
deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued on
Alaska, and as other revenue-net for awards issued on other airlines. In
connection with the change, Alaska recognized a $46.8 million cumulative effect
charge, net of income taxes of $29.5 million, effective January 1, 2000.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” Under this statement, goodwill is considered to have an indefinite
life and will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to periodic
impairment testing. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No.
142. Assuming the Company had adopted this standard as of January 1, 2000, the
Company’s net loss for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 would be
reduced by approximately $2.0 million ($.08 per share) for the impact of
goodwill amortization.

During the second quarter of 2002, the Company completed the first step of its
impairment test related to its $51.4 million of goodwill and determined that
the net book value exceeded its fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the
Company completed the second step of its impairment test and determined that
all of the Company’s goodwill was impaired. As a result, the Company recorded
a one-time, non-cash charge, effective January 1, 2002 of $51.4 million ($12.5
million Alaska and $38.9 million Horizon) to write-off all of its goodwill.
This charge is reflected as a cumulative effect
of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations.

The impact of this statement was also to increase annual results of operations
by $2.0 million resulting from no longer amortizing goodwill.



INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

Seattle, Washington

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alaska Air
Group, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2002 and 2001 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

The Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill upon adoption of SFAS
No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for the year ended December 31,
2002 and for the deferral of revenue on miles sold under the mileage plan for
the year ended December 31, 2000, both discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated
financial statements.
