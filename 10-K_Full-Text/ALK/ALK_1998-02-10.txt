PART I

ITEM 1.	BUSINESS

GENERAL INFORMATION
Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group or the Company) is a holding company 
which was incorporated in Delaware in 1985.  Its two principal 
subsidiaries are Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air 
Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Both subsidiaries operate as airlines, 
although their  business plans, competition and economic risks differ 
substantially.  Alaska is a major airline, operates an all jet fleet, 
and its average passenger trip length is 846 miles.  Horizon is a 
regional airline, operates jet and turboprop aircraft, and its average 
passenger trip is 241 miles. Business segment information is reported in 
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Air Group's executive 
offices are located at 19300 Pacific Highway South, Seattle, Washington 
98188.  The business of the Company is somewhat seasonal, and quarterly 
operating income tends to peak during the third quarter.

Alaska
Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and 
incorporated in 1937.  Alaska serves 35 cities in six states (Alaska, 
Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada and Arizona), one city in Canada, 
four cities in Mexico and five cities in Russia.  In each year since 
1973, Alaska has carried more passengers between Alaska and the U.S. 
mainland than any other airline.    In 1997, Alaska carried 12.3 million 
passengers.  Passenger traffic within Alaska and between Alaska and the 
U.S. mainland accounted for 26% of Alaska's 1997 revenue passenger 
miles, West Coast traffic accounted for 66%, the Mexico markets 8% and 
Russia less than 1%.  Based on passenger enplanements, Alaska's leading 
airports are Seattle, Portland, Anchorage and Los Angeles.  Based on 
revenues, its leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Anchorage, Seattle-Los 
Angeles and Seattle-San Diego.  At December 31, 1997, Alaska's operating 
fleet consisted of 78 jet aircraft.  The majority of Alaska flights, and 
certain Northwest Airlines flights, are dual-designated in airline 
computer reservation systems as Alaska Airlines and Northwest Airlines 
in order to facilitate feed traffic between the two airlines.  Alaska 
Airlines also serves three smaller cities in California, three in 
Washington, and many small communities in Alaska through code share 
marketing agreements with local carriers.

Horizon
Horizon, a Washington corporation, began service in 1981 and was 
acquired by Air Group in 1986.  It is the largest regional airline in 
the Pacific Northwest, and serves 33 cities in five states (Washington, 
Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and California) and four cities in Canada.  In 
1997, Horizon carried 3.7 million passengers.  Based on passenger 
enplanements, Horizon's leading airports are Seattle, Portland, Spokane 
and Boise.  Based on revenues, its leading nonstop routes are Seattle-
Portland, Seattle-Spokane and Seattle-Boise.  At December 31, 1997, 
Horizon's operating fleet consisted of 15 jet and 47 turboprop aircraft. 
Horizon flights are listed under the Alaska Airlines designator code in 
airline computer reservation systems.  Most Horizon flights are also 
dual-designated in these reservation systems as Northwest Airlines and 
Alaska Airlines.  Currently, 32% of Horizon's passengers connect to 
either Alaska or Northwest.

Alaska and Horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide the best 
possible service between any two points served by their systems.  Both 
airlines distinguish themselves from competitors by providing a higher 
level of customer service.  The airlines' excellent service in the form 
of advance seat assignments, a first class section, attention to 
customer needs, high-quality food and beverage service, well-maintained 
aircraft and other amenities has been recognized by independent studies 
and surveys of air travelers.  Alaska and Horizon offer competitive 
fares. 

BUSINESS RISKS
The Company's operations and financial results are subject to various 
uncertainties such as intense competition, volatile fuel prices, a 
largely unionized labor force, the need to finance large capital 
expenditures, government regulation, potential aircraft incidents and 
general economic conditions.

Competition
Competition in the air transportation industry is intense.  Any domestic 
air carrier deemed fit by the DOT is allowed to operate scheduled 
passenger service in the United States.  Together, Alaska and Horizon 
carry 2.3% of all U.S. domestic passenger traffic.  Alaska and Horizon 
compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of their 
routes.  Some of these competitors are substantially larger than Alaska 
and Horizon, have greater financial resources and have more extensive 
route systems.  Due to its shorthaul markets, Horizon is also subject to 
competition from surface transportation, particularly the automobile.

Most major U.S. carriers have developed, independently or in partnership 
with others, large computerized reservation systems (CRS).  Airlines, 
including Alaska, and Horizon, are charged industry-set fees to have 
their flight schedules included in the various CRS displays used by 
travel agents and airlines.  These systems are currently the predominant 
means of distributing airline tickets.  In order to reduce anti-
competitive practices, the DOT regulates the display of all airline 
schedules and fares.  Alaska is exploring alternatives to existing 
distribution methods.

Fuel
Fuel costs represented 14.5% of the Company's total operating expenses 
in 1997.  Fuel prices, which can be volatile and are largely outside of 
the Company's control, can have a significant impact on the Company's 
operating results.  Currently, a one cent change in the fuel price per 
gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately $3.2 million.  The 
Company has in the past hedged against its exposure to fluctuations in 
the price of jet fuel, but does not currently do so.  The Company 
evaluates hedging strategies on an ongoing basis.

Unionized Labor Force
Labor costs represented 33% of the Company's total operating expenses in 
1997.  Wage rates can have a significant impact on the Company's 
operating results.  At December 31, 1997, labor unions represented 88% 
of Alaska's and 43% of Horizon's employees.  The air transportation 
industry is regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the 
National Mediation Board certain regulatory powers with respect to 
disputes between airlines and labor unions.  The Company cannot predict 
the outcome of union contract negotiations nor control actions (e.g. 
work stoppage or slowdown) unions might take to try to influence those 
negotiations.

Leverage and Future Capital Requirements
The Company, like many airlines, is highly leveraged, which increases 
the volatility of its earnings.  Due to high fixed costs, including 
aircraft lease commitments, a decrease in revenues could result in a 
disproportionately greater decrease in earnings.  In addition, the 
Company has an ongoing need to finance new aircraft deliveries and there 
is no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient 
amounts or on acceptable terms.  See Item 7 for management's discussion 
of liquidity and capital resources.

Government Regulation; International Routes
The Company, like other airlines, is subject to regulation by the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the United States Department 
of Transportation (DOT).  The FAA, under its mandate to ensure aviation 
safety, has the authority to ground aircraft and to suspend temporarily 
or revoke permanently the authority of an air carrier or its licensed 
personnel for failure to comply with Federal Aviation Regulations and to 
levy civil penalties for such failure.  The DOT has the authority to 
regulate certain airline economic functions including financial and 
statistical reporting, consumer protection, computerized reservations 
systems, essential air transportation and international route authority.  
The Company is subject to bilateral agreements between the United States 
and the foreign countries to which the Company provides service.  There 
can be no assurance that existing bilateral agreements between the 
United States and the foreign governments will continue or that the 
Company's designation to operate such routes will continue.

Risk of Loss and Liability; Weather
The Company, like other airlines, is exposed to potential catastrophic 
losses in the event of aircraft accidents or terrorist incidents.  
Consistent with industry standards, the Company maintains insurance 
against such losses.  However, any aircraft accident, even if fully 
insured, could cause a negative public perception of the Company with 
adverse financial consequences.  Unusually adverse weather, as occurred 
during December 1996 in the Pacific Northwest, can significantly reduce 
flight operations, resulting in lost revenues and added expenses.

OTHER INFORMATION
Frequent Flyer Program
All major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of 
increasing passenger loyalty.  Alaska's Mileage Plan allows members to 
earn mileage by flying on Alaska, Horizon and other participating 
airlines, and by using the services of non-airline partners, which 
include a credit card partner, telephone companies, hotels and car 
rental agencies.  Alaska is paid by non-airline partners for the miles 
it credits to member accounts.  Alaska has the ability to change the 
Mileage Plan terms, conditions, partners, mileage credits and award 
levels.

Mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other 
travel industry awards.  Upon accumulating the necessary mileage, 
members notify Alaska of their award selection  Over 70% of the flight 
awards selected are subject to blackout dates and capacity-controlled 
seating.  Effective in January 1996, miles have no expiration.  As of 
the year end 1996 and 1997, Alaska estimates that 504,000 and 652,000 
round trip flight awards could have been redeemed by Mileage Plan 
members who have mileage credits exceeding the 20,000 mile free round 
trip domestic ticket award threshold.  At December 31, 1997, fewer than 
4% of these flight awards were issued and outstanding.  For the years 
1995, 1996 and 1997, approximately 242,000, 173,000 and 185,000 round 
trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on Alaska and Horizon.  These 
awards represent approximately 7% for 1995, 4% for 1996, and 3% for 
1997, of the total passenger miles flown for each period.

Alaska maintains a liability for its Mileage Plan obligation which is 
based on its total miles outstanding, less an estimate for miles that 
will never be redeemed.  The net miles outstanding are allocated between 
those credited for travel on Alaska, Horizon or other airline partners 
and those credited for using the services of non-airline partners.  
Miles credited for travel on Alaska, Horizon or other airline partners 
are accrued at Alaska's incremental cost of providing the air travel.  
The incremental cost includes the cost of meals, fuel, reservations and 
insurance.  The incremental cost does not include a contribution to 
overhead, aircraft cost or profit.  A portion of the proceeds received 
from non-airline partners is also deferred.  At December 31, 1996 and 
1997, the total liability for miles outstanding was $17.3 million and 
$22.3 million, respectively.

Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of 
Operations and Financial Condition," discusses future orders and options 
for additional aircraft.

Twelve of the 26 aircraft owned by Alaska as of December 31, 1997 are 
subject to liens securing long-term debt.  Alaska's leased B737-200C, 
B737-400 and MD-80 aircraft have lease expiration dates in 1999, between 
2002 and 2015, and between 1998 and 2013, respectively.  Horizon's 
leased Fairchild Metroliner III, de Havilland Dash 8 and Fokker F-28 
aircraft have expiration dates between 1998 and 2000, 1999 and 2013 and 
2000 and 2002, respectively.  However, as part of its fleet 
standardization plan, Horizon expects to return to the lessors or 
otherwise dispose of all of the Metroliners during 1998.  Alaska and 
Horizon have the option to extend most of the leases for additional 
periods, or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease 
term, usually at the then fair market value of the aircraft.  For 
information regarding obligations under capital leases and long-term 
operating leases, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Special noise ordinances or agreements restrict the type of aircraft, 
the timing and the number of flights operated by Alaska and other air 
carriers at four Los Angeles area airports plus San Diego, Palm Springs, 
San Francisco and Seattle.  At December 31, 1997, all of Alaska's 
aircraft meet the Stage 3 noise requirements under the Airport Noise and 
Capacity Act of 1990.

Ground Facilities and Services
Alaska and Horizon lease ticket counters, gates, cargo and baggage, 
office space and other support areas at the majority of the airports 
they serve.  Alaska also owns terminal buildings at various Alaska 
cities.

Alaska has centralized operations in several buildings located at or 
near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) in Seattle, 
Washington.  The owned buildings, including land unless located on 
leased airport property, include: a three-bay hangar facility with 
maintenance shops; a flight operations and training center; an air cargo 
facility; a reservations and office facility; a four-story office 
building; its corporate headquarters; and two storage warehouses.  
Alaska also leases a two-bay hangar/office facility at Sea-Tac.   

Alaska's other major facilities include: a regional headquarters 
building, an air cargo facility (completed in 1997) and a leased 
hangar/office facility in Anchorage; a Phoenix reservations center; and 
a leased two-bay maintenance facility in Oakland.

Horizon owns its Seattle corporate headquarters building and leases 
maintenance facilities at the Portland and Boise airports.  A new $17 
million operations, training and aircraft maintenance facility is under 
construction in Portland and is expected to be completed in the second 
quarter of 1998.


ITEM 3.	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In October 1991, Alaska gave notice of termination of its code sharing 
and frequent flyer relationship with MarkAir, an airline based in the 
state of Alaska.  Both companies have filed suit against one another in 
connection with that termination asserting breach of contract and other 
claims under state law.  In June 1992, MarkAir filed for protection 
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  In June 1997, MarkAir 
claimed damages of $57 million (later revised to $70 million) in 
connection with Alaska's actions.  In January 1998, MarkAir's counsel 
notified the Company that, after application of attorneys' fees and 
prejudgement interest, its total claim was between $104 and $140 
million.  If MarkAir were to prevail at the $140 million amount, the 
after-tax effect would be to reduce shareholders' equity by 
approximately $82 million or 17%.  However, the Company believes that it 
has valid defenses and is vigorously defending itself against the 
lawsuit.  Trial is scheduled to begin in July 1998.

ITEM 7.	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Industry Conditions
During 1997, as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act, the 10% passenger 
ticket tax was replaced with a new system that combines a percentage tax 
with a per passenger segment fee.  Effective October 1, 1997, the ticket 
tax is 9% plus $1 per segment.  The percentage tax is scheduled to 
decrease over time and the segment fee is scheduled to increase.  The $6 
international departure tax has increased to $12 and a new $12 
international arrival tax has been added.  However, the Act retains the 
$6 rate for travel between Alaska and the U.S. mainland.  This tax and 
the international taxes will be indexed to the CPI beginning January 1, 
1999.  The Taxpayer Relief Act also included these items that will 
affect the Company and the airline industry: (a) a new tax of 7.5% on 
payments to air carriers for the sale of miles in frequent flyer 
programs; (b) a phased-in increase from 50% to 80% for the deductible 
percentage of per diems paid to flight crews; and (c) faster cost 
recovery for alternative minimum tax purposes of aircraft purchased in 
1999 and later years.

During 1996, fuel prices increased significantly for the Company and 
most of its competitors (approximately 20% or 12 cents per gallon over 
1995 levels for Alaska Airlines).  During 1997, fuel prices decreased 
approximately 3.5% from 1996 levels.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
1997 Compared with 1996  Consolidated net income in 1997 was $72.4 
million, or $4.90 per share (basic) and $3.53 per share (diluted), 
compared with net income of $38.0 million, or $2.67 per share (basic) 
and $2.05 per share (diluted) in 1996.  Consolidated operating income 
was $139.0 million in 1997 compared with $89.0 million in 1996.  Of the 
$50.0 million improvement, $35.6 million occurred in the fourth quarter.  
Severe winter storms, high fuel prices and matching of competitors' 
lower fares adversely affected the 1996 fourth quarter.  Alaska's annual 
operating income improved by $44.3 million, while Horizon's improved by 
$5.7 million.  A discussion of operating results for the two airlines 
follows.

Alaska Airlines Operating income increased 49.2% to $134.3 million, 
resulting in a 9.3% operating margin as compared to a 6.9% margin in 
1996.  1997 operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 
7.8% to 9.38 cents while operating expenses per available seat mile 
increased 5.1% to 8.51 cents.

The increase in revenue per ASM was due to a 7.1% increase in system 
passenger yield combined with a 1.3 point improvement in passenger load 
factor.  Most markets, including the three largest (Pacific Northwest - 
Southern California, Seattle - Anchorage and Pacific Northwest - 
Northern California), experienced increases in yields.  Most markets 
also experienced increases in load factor including the Seattle-
Anchorage market, which had a 4.9 point improvement.  The higher yields 
and load factors reflect a more stabilized competitive environment in 
1997.

Freight and mail revenues decreased 3.6% in the first half of 1997 due 
to more competition and increased 4.1% in the second half due to 
increased cargo capacity and higher mail rates.

Other-net revenues were essentially unchanged because an additional $5 
million of proceeds from partners in Alaska's frequent flyer program 
were offset by a similar increase in the frequent flyer award liability.

The table below shows the major operating expense elements on a cost per 
available seat mile (ASM) basis in 1996 and 1997.

Alaska's higher unit costs were primarily due to increased labor costs.  
Significant unit cost changes are discussed below.

Employees increased 7.6% (primarily in reservations and customer service 
positions) to service the 4.1% increase in passengers and also to 
improve on-time within 15 minutes flight departure performance, which 
improved from 77% on-time in 1996 to 82% on-time in 1997.  Excluding 
profit sharing, average wages and benefits per employee were up 2.7%, 
primarily due to higher pilot wage rates and higher health insurance 
costs.  The net effect was that wages and benefits expense increased 
more than the ASM growth, resulting in a 7% increase in cost per ASM.

Profit sharing expense increased the cost per ASM by .07 cents.  
Effective for 1997, Alaska changed its profit sharing program so that 
eligible employees will receive their pro rata share of 10% of Alaska's 
adjusted pre-tax profits starting with the first dollar of pre-tax 
profits.

Fuel expense per ASM decreased 4%, primarily due to a 3.5% decrease in 
the price of fuel.

Maintenance expense per ASM increased 16% because significantly more 
engine repair expense was incurred in 1997 and a smaller proportion of 
airframe maintenance costs were capitalized.

Commission expense per ASM increased 10%, less than the 13% increase in 
passenger revenues because a lower percentage of sales were made by 
travel agents.  In addition, the commission rate paid to travel agents 
decreased from 10% to 8% for sales made after September 30, 1997.
The gain on sale of assets in 1996 is primarily due to the sale of three 
jet aircraft.

Other expense per ASM increased 12%, primarily due to higher costs 
related to property and other taxes, flight crew hotels, employee hiring 
and communications.

Horizon Air  Operating income increased from $0.1 million to $5.8 
million, resulting in a 1.9% operating margin as compared to a zero 
margin in 1996.  For 1997, operating revenue per ASM increased 1.9% to 
21.00 cents while operating expenses per available seat mile remained 
even at 20.60 cents.

The increase in revenue per ASM was due to a 2.2 point increase in 
system passenger load factor, partially offset by a 1.8% decrease in 
passenger yield.  The Seattle-to-Canada, Seattle-to-Montana and the 
Seattle-Boise markets experienced significant increases in load factors.  
The decrease in yields is believed to be due to a longer average 
passenger trip length in 1997 and to the presence of the passenger 
transportation tax for 10 months in 1997 versus 4 months in 1996.

The table below shows the major operating expense elements on a cost per 
ASM basis for Horizon in 1996 and 1997.

Horizon Air	                     Operating Expenses Per ASM (In Cents)

NM = Not Meaningful

Wages and benefits per ASM increased, primarily due to higher wage 
rates, payroll taxes and more 401(k) plan employer matching costs.  
Profit sharing expense increased due to profitable operations.  
Contracted services increased due to higher security screening and 
hiring costs.  Food and beverage decreased due to a conscious effort to 
reduce costs and improve efficiency.  Other expense decreased due to 
less flight crew training and personnel costs, lower insurance rates and 
decreased supplies expense.



Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense)  Nonoperating expense 
decreased $9.3 million to $15.4 million, primarily due to smaller 
average debt balances, lower interest rates on variable interest rate 
debt and more interest capitalized.

1996 Compared with 1995  Consolidated net income in 1996 was $38.0 
million, or $2.67 per share (basic) and $2.05 per share (diluted), 
compared with net income of $17.3 million, or $1.28 per share (basic) 
and $1.26 per share (diluted) in 1995.  Consolidated operating income 
was $89.0 million compared with $75.7 million in 1995.  Alaska's 
operating income improved by $17.7 million, but it was offset by lower 
operating results at Horizon.

Alaska Airlines  Operating income increased 24.5% to $90.0 million, 
resulting in a 6.9% operating margin as compared with a 6.3% margin in 
1995.  Operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 5.8% to 
8.70 cents while operating expenses per ASM decreased 5.1% to 8.10 
cents.  The increase in revenue per ASM was primarily due to a 4.2 point 
improvement in system passenger load factor.  Higher unit costs were 
largely due to higher fuel prices and heavier passenger loads.

Horizon Air  Operating income decreased 98% to $0.1 million primarily 
due to the fourth quarter, which was negatively impacted by adverse 
weather, increased competition, higher than normal maintenance expense 
and costs associated with transitioning to a simplified fleet.

Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense)  Nonoperating expense 
decreased from $41.7 million to $24.7 million primarily due to lower 
interest rates on variable debt and smaller average debt balances.  In 
addition, 1995 included a $2.2 million write-off of capitalized debt 
issuance costs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

1997 Financial Changes  The Company's cash and marketable securities 
portfolio increased by $111 million during 1997.  Operating activities 
provided $205 million of cash in 1997.  Additional cash was provided by 
the sale and leaseback of four B737-400 aircraft and 13 Dash 8-200 
aircraft ($247 million), issuance of common stock ($129 million) and 
issuance of long-term debt ($28 million).  Cash was used for $439 
million of capital expenditures including the purchase of two new MD-83 
aircraft, three new B737-400 aircraft, a previously leased B737-400 
aircraft, 13 new Dash 8-200 aircraft, flight equipment deposits and 
airframe and engine overhauls, net repayment of short-term borrowings 
($47 million) and the repayment of debt ($26 million).
Like most airlines, the Company has a working capital deficit.  The 
existence of a working capital deficit has not in the past impaired the 
Company's ability to meet its obligations as they become due and it is 
not expected to do so in the future.

Shareholders' equity increased by $203 million due to the sale of 3.45 
million shares of common stock and net income of $72 million.  These 
factors increased equity to 54% of capital, an improvement of 14 
percentage points.

Financing Activities   During 1997, Alaska sold four B737-400 aircraft 
and leased them back for 18 years; Horizon sold 13 Dash 8-200 aircraft 
and leased them back for 15 years.

In November 1997, Standard & Poors raised its corporate credit rating on 
Air Group and Alaska to double B minus from single B plus, citing a 
stabilized competitive position and improving financial profile.

In January 1998, the Company called its 6-7/8% convertible subordinated 
debentures and, based on recent stock prices, expects that substantially 
all of them will be converted into 1.608 million shares of common stock.

Commitments  During 1997, Alaska's lease commitments increased 
approximately $194 million due to the sale and leaseback of four B737-
400 aircraft.  In addition, Alaska ordered 15 Boeing 737 aircraft along 
with an option to acquire 10 more.  The value of the orders is 
approximately $510 million.  Horizon's lease commitments increased 
approximately $156 million due to the acquisition of 13 new Dash 8-200 
aircraft.  In addition, Horizon ordered 10 new Dash 8-200 aircraft, 
valued at approximately $100 million.  At December 31, 1997, the Company 
had firm orders for 46 aircraft with a total cost of approximately 
$1,015 million as set forth below.  In addition, Alaska has options to 
acquire 22 more B737s and Horizon has options to acquire 25 more Dash 8-
200s.  Alaska and Horizon expect to finance the new planes with either 
leases, long-term debt or internally generated cash.

The Company accrues the costs associated with returning leased aircraft 
over the lease period.  As leased aircraft are retired, the costs are 
charged against the established reserve.  At December 31, 1997, $43 
million was reserved for leased aircraft returns. 

Deferred Taxes  At December 31, 1997, net deferred tax liabilities were 
$62 million, which includes $112 million of net temporary differences 
offset by $50 million of Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credits.  The 
Company believes that all of its deferred tax assets, including its AMT 
credits, will be realized through profitable operations.

Year 2000 Computer Issue  During the past eight years, the Company has 
been engaged in a number of projects to improve its information 
technology infrastructure.  The Company expects to complete these 
projects during 1998 and 1999 at an estimated cost of $5 to $10 million.  
As a result of these activities, the Company's systems will be Year 2000 
compliant.  The direct cost of projects solely intended to correct Year 
2000 problems is expected to be less than $1 million.

1996 Financial Changes  The Company's cash and marketable securities 
portfolio decreased by $33 million during 1996.  Operating activities 
provided $223 million of cash in 1996.  Additional cash was provided by 
the sale and leaseback of three B737-400 aircraft ($86 million), the 
sale of three MD-80 aircraft ($52 million) and proceeds received from 
the issuance of common stock ($21 million).  Cash was used for the 
purchase of two new MD-83 aircraft, two used B737-400 aircraft, two 
previously leased B737-200Cs, airframe and engine overhauls and other 
capital expenditures ($209 million), and aircraft purchase deposits ($61 
million).  Cash was also used to repay net short-term borrowings ($19 
million), and $134 million of long-term debt (including $100 million 
repaid early).  During 1996, Alaska replaced its $75 million credit 
facility with a $125 million credit facility with substantially the same 
terms and conditions.

1995 Financial Changes The Company's cash and marketable securities 
portfolio increased by $30 million during 1995.  Operating activities 
provided $126 million of cash in 1995.  Additional cash was provided by 
flight equipment deposits returned ($11 million), net short-term 
borrowings ($41 million), the sale and leaseback of two B737-400 
aircraft ($56 million) and new long-term debt proceeds ($129 million).  
Cash was used for the purchase of one previously leased B737-400 
aircraft, airframe and engine overhauls and other capital expenditures 
($103 million) and the repayment of debt and capital lease obligations 
($237 million).  Included in the above numbers are the June 1995 
issuance of $132.3 million of 6-1/2% convertible senior debentures due 
2005, and the August 1995 redemption of the 7-1/4% zero coupon, 
convertible subordinated notes for $127.7 million

EFFECT OF INFLATION  Inflation and specific price changes do not have a 
significant effect on the Company's operating revenues, operating 
expenses and operating income, because such revenues and expenses 
generally reflect current price levels.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Alaska Air Group, Inc.
December 31, 1997

Note 1.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alaska Air 
Group, Inc. (Company or Air Group) and its subsidiaries, the principal 
subsidiaries being Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air 
Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  All significant intercompany transactions 
are eliminated.  Preparation of financial statements requires the use of 
management's estimates.  Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.  Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years' 
financial statements to conform to the 1997 presentation.

Alaska and Horizon operate as airlines.  However, their business plans, 
competition and economic risks differ substantially.  Alaska is a major 
airline serving Alaska, the West Coast, Mexico and Eastern Russia.  It 
operates an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is 846 miles.  
Horizon is a regional airline serving the Pacific Northwest, Northern 
California and Western Canada.  It operates both jet and turboprop 
aircraft, and its average passenger trip is 241 miles.  Substantially 
all of Alaska's and Horizon's sales occur in the United States.  See 
Note 11 for operating segment information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. They are carried at cost, which 
approximates market.  The Company reduces its cash balance when checks 
are disbursed.  Due to the time delay in checks clearing the banks, the 
Company normally maintains a negative cash balance on its books which is 
reported as a current liability.  The amount of the negative cash 
balance was $12.5 million and $10.1 million at December 31, 1996 and 
1997, respectively.

Inventories and Supplies
Expendable and repairable aircraft parts, as well as other materials and 
supplies, are stated at average cost.  An allowance for obsolescence is 
accrued on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the 
aircraft.  Inventories related to the retired B727 fleet and other 
surplus items are carried at their net realizable value.  The allowance 
at December 31, 1996 and 1997 for all inventories was $16.1 million and 
$18.0 million, respectively.

Property, Equipment and Depreciation
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the 
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which are as 
follows:
Aircraft and other
	flight equipment	           8-20 years
Buildings                  	10-30 years
Capitalized leases and 
	leasehold improvements  	Term of lease
Other equipment             	3-15 years

Assets and related obligations for items financed under capital leases 
are initially recorded at an amount equal to the present value of the 
future minimum lease payments.  The cost of major airframe overhauls, 
engine overhauls, and other modifications which extend the life or 
improve the usefulness of aircraft are capitalized and amortized over 
their estimated period of use.  Other repair and maintenance costs are 
expensed when incurred.  The Company periodically reviews long-lived 
assets for impairment.

Capitalized Interest
Interest is capitalized on flight equipment purchase deposits and ground 
facilities progress payments as a cost of the related asset and is 
depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset.

Intangible Assets-Subsidiaries
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets 
acquired is recorded as an intangible asset and is amortized over 40 
years.  Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1996 and 1997 was $21.1 
million and $23.1 million, respectively.

Deferred Income
Deferred income results from the sale and leaseback of aircraft, the 
receipt of manufacturer or vendor credits, and from the sale of foreign 
tax benefits.  This income is recognized over the term of the applicable 
agreements.

Frequent Flyer Awards
Alaska operates a frequent flyer award program that provides travel 
awards to members based on accumulated mileage.  The estimated 
incremental cost of providing free travel is recognized as an expense 
and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated.  Alaska also defers 
recognition of income on a portion of the payments it receives from 
travel partners associated with its frequent flyer program.  The 
frequent flyer award liability is relieved as travel awards are issued.

Passenger Revenues
Passenger revenues are considered earned at the time service is 
provided.  Tickets sold but not yet used are reported as air traffic 
liability. 


Contracted Services
Contracted services includes the expenses for aircraft ground handling, 
security, temporary employees and other similar services.

Other Selling Expenses
Other selling expenses includes credit card commissions, computerized 
reservations systems (CRS) charges, advertising and promotional costs.  
The costs of advertising are expensed the first time the advertising 
takes place.  Advertising expense was $15.2 million, $15.6 million, and 
$11.0 million, respectively, in 1995, 1996 and 1997.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 109, which requires the recognition of deferred 
tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of 
events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements 
or tax returns.

Stock Options
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in 
accounting for stock options.  See Note 6 for more information.

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to 
hedge interest rate risk.  The differential to be paid or received from 
these agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognized 
currently in the income statement.  The Company periodically enters into 
hedge agreements to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the price of 
jet fuel.  A gain or loss is recorded quarterly if the fuel index 
average exceeds the ceiling price or falls below the floor price.

Note 2.	Marketable Securities
Marketable securities are investments that are readily convertible to 
cash and have original maturities that exceed three months.  They are 
classified as available for sale and consisted of the following at 
December 31 (in millions):

* weighted average for 1997

At December 31, 1997, borrowings of $218.4 million are secured by flight 
equipment and real property.  The 6-1/2% and 6-7/8% debentures are 
convertible into common stock at $21.50 and $33.60 per share, 
respectively, subject to adjustments in certain events.  The 6-1/2% 
debentures are redeemable at the Company's option on or after June 15, 
1998, initially at a redemption price of 104.33% of the principal 
amount, declining ratably to 100% over six years.  The 6-7/8% debentures 
are redeemable at the Company's option at a redemption price of 101.38% 
of the principal amount at December 31, 1997, declining ratably to 100% 
on June 15, 1999.

At December 31, 1997, Alaska had a $125 million credit facility with 
commercial banks.  Advances under this facility may be for up to a 
maximum maturity of four years.  Borrowings may be used for aircraft 
acquisitions or other corporate purposes, and they bear interest at a 
rate which varies based on LIBOR.  At December 31, 1997, no borrowings 
were outstanding under this credit facility.
Certain Alaska loan agreements contain provisions that require 
maintenance of specific levels of net worth, leverage and fixed charge 
coverage, and limit investments, lease obligations, sales of assets and 
additional indebtedness.  At December 31, 1997, the Company was in 
compliance with all loan provisions, and under the most restrictive loan 
provisions, Alaska had $140 million of net worth above the minimum.

At December 31, 1997, long-term debt principal payments for the next 
five years were (in millions):
1998		$26.3
1999		$26.3
2000		$57.3
2001		$47.6
2002		$14.5

Note 5.	Commitments
Lease Commitments
Lease contracts for 113 aircraft have remaining lease terms of one to 18 
years.  The majority of airport and terminal facilities are also leased.  
Total rent expense was $201.9 million, $214.7 million and $218.7 
million, in 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  Future minimum lease 
payments under long-term operating leases and capital leases as of 
December 31, 1997 are shown below (in millions):
                      		Operating Leases   	Capital
                  		  Aircraft 	Facilities	  Leases
1998	                   $178.2	      $16.9	   $ 4.1
1999	                    165.6	       16.7     	4.1

Less amount representing interest		            (1.7)
Present value of capital lease payments	      $25.6

Aircraft Commitments
The Company has firm orders for 24 Boeing 737 series aircraft to be 
delivered between 1998 and 2002 and 22 Dash 8-200s to be delivered 
between 1998 and 2005.  The total amount of these commitments is 
approximately $1.015 billion.  As of December 31, 1997, deposits related 
to the future equipment deliveries were $100.6 million.  In addition to 
the ordered aircraft, the Company holds purchase options on 22 Boeing 
737s and 25 Dash 8-200s.

Note 6.	Stock Plans
Air Group has three stock option plans, which provide for the purchase 
of Air Group common stock at a stipulated price on the date of grant by 
certain officers and key employees of Air Group and its subsidiaries. 
Under the 1988 Plan, options for 1,720,700 shares were granted.  Under 
the 1996 and 1997 Plans, options for 519,900 shares have been granted 
and, at December 31, 1997, 401,975 shares were available for grant.  
Under all plans, the incentive and nonqualified stock options granted 
have terms of up to approximately ten years.  Grantees are 25% vested 
after one year, 50% after two years, 75% after three years and 100% 
after four years.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant 
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following 
assumptions used for grants in 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively: 
dividend yield of 0%, 0% and 0%; volatility of 37%, 36% and 34%; risk-
free interest rates of 6.46%, 6.33% and 5.69%; and expected lives of 5, 
5 and 5 years.  Using these assumptions, the weighted average fair value 
of options granted was $6.69, $9.58 and $14.04 in 1995, 1996 and 1997, 
respectively.

Air Group follows APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in 
accounting for stock options.  Accordingly, no compensation cost has 
been recognized for these plans.  Had compensation cost for the 
Company's stock options been determined in accordance with Financial 
Accounting Standard 123, net income and earnings per share (EPS) would 
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below.  The 
reductions in future years are likely to be larger than shown below 
because options vest over four years and new grants are typically made 
each year.
                    	1995     	1996     	1997
Net income (in millions):
 As reported       	$17.3    	$38.0    	$72.4
 Pro forma	          17.1     	37.4     	71.4

Changes in the number of shares subject to option, with their weighted 
average exercise prices, are summarized below:
                              	Shares   	Price
Outstanding, Dec. 31, 1994		1,044,143	  $17.15

Canceled	                     	(8,125)  	17.03
Outstanding, Dec. 31, 1997		  879,925  	$23.72

At December 31, 1997, 245,800 of the outstanding options (none of which 
are currently exercisable) had an exercise price of $35.25 and a 
remaining contractual life of 10.0 years.  The other 634,125 outstanding 
options had a weighted average exercise price of $19.24 (ranging from 
$15.00 to $24.00), and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 
7.9 years.  The number of shares exercisable at year-end with their 
weighted average exercise prices, are summarized below:
                   	 Shares   	Price
December 31, 1995	 	596,338	  $17.24
December 31, 1996		 243,675	   16.70
December 31, 1997		 161,775	   19.08


Note 7.	Employee Benefit Plans
Pension Plans
Four defined benefit and five defined contribution retirement plans 
cover various employee groups of Alaska and Horizon.  The defined 
benefit plans provide benefits based on an employee's term of service 
and average compensation for a specified period of time before 
retirement.  Pension plans are funded as required by the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  

The defined benefit plan assets are primarily common stocks and fixed 
income securities.  Plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit 
obligation at December 31, 1996 and 1997.  The following table sets 
forth the funded status of the plans at December 31, 1996 and 1997 (in 
millions):
                                	1996    	1997
Benefit obligation -
Vested	                        $180.9  	$211.5
	Nonvested	                      22.1    	38.4
Accumulated benefit 
  obligation		                 $203.0  	$249.9
 
Plan assets at fair value	     $223.7  	$289.2
Projected benefit obligation  		230.7   	307.4
Plan assets less projected 
benefit obligation	              (7.0)  	(18.2)
Unrecognized transition asset		  (0.8)		  (0.5)
Unrecognized prior service cost 		2.6	   	60.1
Unrecognized loss		             	32.6   		(0.8)
Prepaid pension cost		         $ 27.4	 	$ 40.6
 
The weighted average discount rate used to determine the projected 
benefit obligation was 7.5% and 7.25% as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, 
respectively.  The calculation assumed a weighted average rate of 
increase for future compensation levels of 5.1% and 3.2% for 1996 and 
1997, respectively.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan 
assets used in 1996 and 1997 was 10%.


Net pension expense for the defined benefit plans included the following 
components for 1995, 1996 and 1997 (in millions):	

                           		1995    	1996    	1997
Service cost (benefits earned
during the period)	        $	11.4	  $	15.9	  $	17.3
Interest cost on projected
benefit obligation	          12.9    	15.4    	17.3
Actual return on  assets	   (37.0)  	(23.6)  	(47.6)
Net amortization
	and deferral               	23.3     	6.5    	26.4
Net pension expense	       $	10.6	  $	14.2	  $	13.4
 
The defined contribution plans are deferred compensation plans under 
section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Some of these plans 
require Company matching contributions based on a percentage of 
participants' contributions.  One plan has an Employee Stock Ownership 
Plan (ESOP) feature.  The ESOP owns Air Group common shares which are 
held in trust for eligible employees.  The Company has recorded deferred 
compensation to reflect the value of the shares not yet allocated to 
eligible employees' accounts.  As these shares are allocated to 
employees, compensation expense is recorded and deferred compensation is 
reduced.

Alaska and Horizon also maintain an unfunded, noncontributory benefit 
plan for certain elected officers.  The present value of unfunded 
benefits for this plan was accrued as of December 31, 1996 and 1997.

Total expense for all pension plans was $22.2 million, $26.5 million and 
$29.0 million, respectively, in 1995, 1996 and 1997.

Profit Sharing Plans
Alaska and Horizon have employee profit sharing plans.  Profit sharing 
expense for 1995, 1996 and 1997 was $-0-, $0.9 million and $13.5 
million, respectively.


Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company allows retirees to continue their medical, dental and vision 
benefits by paying all or a portion of the active employee plan premium 
until eligible for Medicare, currently age 65.  This results in a 
subsidy to retirees because the premiums received by the Company are 
less than the actual cost of the retirees' claims.  The accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for this subsidy at December 
31, 1996 and 1997 was $13.5 million and $15.7 million, respectively.  
The APBO is unfunded and is included with other liabilities on the 
Balance Sheet.  Annual expense related to this subsidy is not considered 
material to disclose.

Note 8.	Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the timing of 
recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting 
purposes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise the following at 
December 31 (in millions):

                              	1996       	1997
Excess of tax over book
  depreciation	              $146.7     	$161.8

Net deferred 
tax liabilities              	$ 38.9	     $ 61.8
 
After consideration of temporary differences, taxable income for 1997 
was approximately $99 million, which was partially offset by net 
operating losses generated in prior years.  At December 31, 1997, no 
federal loss carryforwards remain.

The components of income tax expense were as follows (in millions):
                   		1995	   1996   	1997
Current tax expense:
	Federal	           $ 5.0  	$17.5	 $ 26.4
	State	               0.3    	0.9    	1.9
Total current	        5.3   	18.4	   28.3
Deferred tax expense:

	State	               2.2    	1.2    	4.4
Total deferred       11.4    	7.9   	22.9
Total tax expense  	$16.7  	$26.3	  $51.2
 
Income tax expense reconciles to the amount computed by applying the 
U.S. federal rate of 35% to income before taxes as follows (in 
millions):	
                        	1995   	1996	   1997

Note 9.	Earnings per Share
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share 
(EPS) was adopted for 1997 calendar year reporting.  FAS 128 replaces 
"primary" and "fully-diluted" EPS with "basic" and "diluted" EPS. Basic 
EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the average number of common 
shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income 
plus the after-tax interest expense on convertible debt by the average 
common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would have 
been outstanding if conversion of the convertible debt and exercise of 
in-the-money stock options is assumed.  EPS calculations were as follows 
(in millions except per share amounts):
                             	1995    	1996    	1997
Net income	                  $17.3   	$38.0   	$72.4
Avg. shares outstanding	    13.471  	14.241  	14.785
Basic earnings per share	    $1.28   	$2.67   	$4.90
Net income	                  $17.3   	$38.0   	$72.4

Note 10.	 Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments were as 
follows (in millions):
                            December 31, 1996
                          	Carrying	     Fair

                         			December 31, 1997
                          	Carrying	     Fair

Long-term debt	               404.5    	521.7
The fair value of cash equivalents approximates carrying value due to 
the short maturity of these instruments.  The fair value of marketable 
securities is based on quoted market prices.  The fair value of 
restricted deposits approximates the carrying amount.  The fair value of 
publicly traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices, and the 
fair value of other debt approximates carrying value.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alaska Air Group, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Alaska 
Air Group, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 
31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of income, 
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 1997.  These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alaska Air 
Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997and 1996, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic 
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in Item 
14(a) is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic 
financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing 
procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and, 
in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to 
the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
