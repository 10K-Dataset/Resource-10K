PART I

ITEM 1. OUR BUSINESS

We are a
Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and we have two principal subsidiaries: Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Through these subsidiaries, we provide passenger air service to approximately
25 million passengers per year to nearly 100 destinations. We also provide freight and mail services, primarily to and within the state of Alaska and on the West Coast. Although Alaska and Horizon both operate as airlines, their business plans,
competition, and economic risks differ substantially. Alaska is a major airline that operates an all-jet fleet with an average passenger trip length in 2008 of 1,113 miles. Horizon is a regional airline, operates turboprop and jet aircraft, and its
average passenger trip length for 2008 was 357 miles. Individual financial information about Alaska and Horizon is in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and throughout this report, specifically in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Both of our airlines
endeavor to distinguish themselves from competitors by providing a higher level of customer service and differentiating amenities. Our outstanding employees and excellent service in the form of advance seat assignments, expedited check-in, web
check-in, flight alerts, attention to customer needs, an award-winning frequent flyer program, well-maintained aircraft, a first-class section aboard Alaska aircraft, and other amenities are regularly recognized by independent studies, awards, and
surveys of air travelers. For example, Alaska received the J.D. Power and Associates “Highest Customer Satisfaction” award in 2008 among North America Airlines in a tie with Continental Airlines and won the “Program of the Year”
Freddie award for 2007 for our Mileage Plan program. Additionally, Horizon was named “2007 Regional Airline of the Year” by Air Transport World. We are very proud of these awards and we continue to strive to have the best customer service
in the industry.

OUR AIRLINES

ALASKA

Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation
that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937. We offer extensive north/south service within the western U.S., Canada and Mexico, and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of Alaska. We also provide long-haul east/west
service to Hawaii and nine cities in the continental U.S., primarily from Seattle, where we have our largest concentration of departures; although we do offer long-haul departures from Anchorage, Los Angeles, and Portland, Oregon. During 2008, we
initiated service to Maui with non-stops from Seattle and Anchorage, to the Big Island of Hawaii with non-stops from Seattle, and non-stop service from Seattle to Minneapolis. We also recently announced non-stop service from Seattle to Austin, TX
and Portland to Maui, both beginning in August 2009.

In 2008, we carried
16.8 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations, and in each year since 1973, we have carried more passengers between Alaska and the U.S. mainland than any other airline. Based on the



number of passengers, Alaska’s leading airports are Seattle, Los Angeles, Anchorage and Portland. Based on 2008 revenues, the leading nonstop routes are
Seattle-Anchorage, Seattle-Los Angeles, and Seattle-San Diego. At December 31, 2008, Alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 110 jet aircraft, compared to 115 aircraft as of December 31, 2007.

Alaska’s passenger traffic by market is presented below:

HORIZON

Horizon Air Industries, a Washington corporation that first began service and was
incorporated in 1981, was acquired by Air Group in 1986. It is the largest regional airline in the Pacific Northwest, and serves a number of cities in seven states, five cities in Canada, and two cities in Mexico. Horizon initiated service to Loreto
and La Paz, Mexico from Los Angeles in 2008. Additionally, Horizon launched service to Prescott and Flagstaff, Arizona, and Mammoth Lakes, California, in 2008.

In 2008, Horizon carried 7.4 million revenue passengers. Approximately 91% of Horizon’s revenue passenger miles in 2008 were flown domestically, primarily in the
states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, compared to 92% in 2007. The Canada markets accounted for 8% of revenue passenger miles in both 2008 and 2007. Flying to Mexico in 2008 accounted for less than 1% of total revenue passenger miles.
Based on passenger enplanements, Horizon’s leading airports are

Seattle, Portland, Boise, and Spokane. Based on revenues in 2008, the leading nonstop routes are Portland-Seattle, Spokane-Seattle, and
Boise-Seattle. At December 31, 2008, Horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 18 jets and 41 turboprop aircraft. Horizon flights are listed under the Alaska Airlines designator code in airline reservation systems.

Alaska and Horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide convenient, competitive connections
between most points served by their systems. In 2008 and 2007, approximately 23% and 22%, respectively, of Horizon’s passengers connected to flights operated by Alaska.

INDUSTRY CONDITIONS

2008 proved to be an extremely challenging year for the airline industry. We faced record high fuel prices that resulted in liquidation of several
airlines and threatened the viability of others. Ancillary fees were added by most carriers to help offset the rising price of fuel. The last half of the year saw significant declines in the price of oil, but that soon became overshadowed by the
economic recession in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, the industry is sharply reducing capacity to help offset the declining demand. Alaska and Horizon plan to reduce capacity in 2009 by 8% and 9%, respectively.

The airline industry is highly competitive and has historically been characterized by low profit
margins and high fixed costs, primarily for wages, aircraft fuel, aircraft ownership, and facilities rents. Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the number of
passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results. In other words, a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations.
Passenger demand and ticket prices are, to a large measure, influenced by the general state of the economy, current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity.



FUEL

Our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and, potentially, the availability of jet fuel. Fuel prices have been extremely volatile over the past few
years. The price of crude oil rose from just under $90 per barrel in January 2008 up to nearly $150 per barrel in July 2008. Subsequent to its record high, oil prices began to drop sharply in the last half of 2008 and ended the year around $40 per
barrel. For us, a $1 per barrel increase in the price of oil equates to approximately $9 million of additional fuel cost annually.

We refer to the price we pay at the airport or “into-plane” price, including applicable taxes, as our “raw” fuel price. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world
oil prices and refining costs,

which can vary by region in the U.S. Generally, West Coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and substantially more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast,
putting both Alaska and Horizon at a competitive disadvantage. Historically, fuel costs have generally represented 10% to 15% of an airline’s operating costs. However, in recent years, because of the rise in prices, fuel expense represents 30%
to 40% of total operating costs for airlines. Both the crude oil and refining cost components of jet fuel are volatile and outside of our control, and they can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results. Even with the sharp
decline in prices in the last half of 2008, our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 42% in 2008 and 8% and 17% in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We use crude oil call options almost exclusively as hedges to
decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Call options effectively cap our pricing on the crude oil component of fuel prices, limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for a percentage of our planned fuel consumption. With
these call option contracts, we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices, as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts. We also use collar structures in limited instances for fuel hedging
purposes. Additionally, we enter into fuel purchase contracts that fix the refining margin we pay on a certain percentage of our fuel consumption.

Fuel costs, including gains and losses stemming from changes in the value of our hedge portfolio,

were approximately 36% of our total operating
expenses in 2008, 27% in 2007 and 26% in 2006. For 2009, a one-cent change in our hedged fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately $3.5 million. In addition to our hedging program, we believe that operating fuel-efficient
aircraft helps to mitigate the effect of high fuel prices. At Alaska we have completed our fleet transition out of the MD-80 aircraft to more fuel-efficient B737-800 aircraft, and at Horizon we are currently transitioning to an all-Q400 turboprop
fleet. Alaska also retrofitted its B737-900 fleet with winglets in 2008. As a result, the fuel burn expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon (ASMs/g) improved over the past two years from 65.9 ASMs/g in 2006 to 69.5 ASMs/g in 2008. This
reduction has not only reduced our fuel cost, but



also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that we emit.

Although we do not anticipate a significant reduction in jet fuel availability because of the decline in global demand, dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the
possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel. In the event of significant hostilities or other conflicts in oil-producing areas,
there could be reductions in the production and/or importation of crude oil resulting in price increases, which could adversely affect our business. If there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel, our business would be adversely
affected.

MARKETING AND COMPETITION

ALLIANCES WITH OTHER AIRLINES

We have marketing alliances with several other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage
credit and redemption privileges as well as code sharing on certain flights as shown in the table below. Alliances enhance our revenues by:

•

offering our customers more travel destinations and better mileage credit/redemption opportunities;

•

giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines; and

•

providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska and Horizon while earning mileage credit in our partners’
programs.

Most of our codeshare relationships are free-sell
codeshares, where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the

operating carrier’s inventory, but takes no inventory risk. Our marketing agreements have various
termination dates, and at any time, one or more may be in the process of renegotiation.

Our marketing alliances with other airlines as of December 31, 2008 are as follows:

(1)

This airline does not have its own frequent flyer program. However, Alaska’s Mileage Plan members can earn and redeem miles on this airline’s route system.

(2)

Alaska has codeshare agreements with the Delta Connection carriers Skywest and ASA as part of its agreement with Delta.

(3)

Alaska Mileage Plan members can earn miles on Mokulele, but redemption of miles is not currently available.

(4)

Our agreement with Northwest will continue to be effective until they cease operation as a separate entity from Delta. At the time that Northwest ceases operation, the agreement with Delta
will include those Northwest operations.



COMPETITION

Competition in the airline industry is intense. We believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are:

•

safety record and reputation,

•

flight schedules,

•

fares,

•

customer service,

•

routes served,

•

frequent flyer programs,

•

on-time arrivals,

•

baggage handling,

•

on-board amenities,

•

type of aircraft, and

•

code-sharing relationships.

Together, Alaska and Horizon carry approximately 3.2% of all U.S. domestic passenger traffic. We compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of our routes,
including Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (including Northwest), Continental Airlines, American Airlines, US Airways, JetBlue Airways, Virgin America and regional affiliates associated with some of these carriers. Most of these
airlines are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognition than our companies and some have lower operating costs. In addition, competitors that have successfully reorganized out of bankruptcy have lower operating costs derived
from renegotiated labor, supply and financing agreements. Some of these competitors have chosen to add service, reduce their fares, or both in our markets. We may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or
discounted fares in the markets that we serve. Due to its short-haul markets, Horizon also competes with ground transportation in many markets, including train, bus and automobile transportation.

TICKET DISTRIBUTION

Airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels:

•

Alaskaair.com

. It is less expensive for us to sell through this direct channel and, as a result, we continue to take steps to drive more business to our website. In
addition, we believe this channel is preferable from a branding and customer-relationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the customer and tailor offers accordingly. In 2008, we processed approximately 45% of our sales
through our website, compared to 43% in 2007 – a sign of progress toward our goal of transitioning more of our customers to this direct sales channel.

•

Traditional and online travel agents

. Consumer reliance on traditional travel agencies continues to shrink, giving way to online travel agencies. Both traditional and
online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems (GDS), such as Sabre, to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines. Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline. Many of our large
corporate customers require that we use these agencies. Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and, as a result, have lower ticket distribution costs.

•

Reservation call centers

. These call centers are located in Phoenix, Arizona; Kent, Washington; and Boise, Idaho. We generally charge a $15 fee for booking
reservations through these call centers.

Our sales by channel are
presented below:



EMPLOYEES

Labor costs have historically made up 30% to 40% of an airline’s total operating costs. Most major airlines, including ours, have employee groups that are covered by
collective bargaining agreements. Often, airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces, and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new
competition. New entrants into the U.S. airline industry generally do not have unionized work forces, which can be a competitive advantage for those airlines. In 2008, we were able to reduce wages and benefits costs compared to 2007, primarily due
to a decline in defined benefit pension costs and a decline in the number of full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) at both companies. The reduction in FTEs was driven by a reduction in work forces at both companies to coincide with planned capacity
reductions and the improvement in operational performance at both companies that resulted in less overtime pay. However, we expect to see continued upward pressure on wages and benefits in the future due to normal step increases and increased
benefits costs, primarily pension and health care costs. We recognize the need to continue to improve employee productivity in order to mitigate this cost pressure and to reduce our wages and benefits on an available-seat-mile basis. Horizon has
been successful in improving productivity, when measured as number of passengers per FTE, with year-over-year improvements in 25 of the last 28 quarters.

We had 14,143 (10,250 at Alaska and 3,893 at Horizon) active full-time and part-time employees at December 31, 2008, compared to 14,710 (10,526 at Alaska and 4,184 at Horizon)
as of

December 31, 2007. Wages, salaries and benefits (including variable incentive pay) represented approximately 40% and 41% of our total non-fuel operating expenses in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

At December 31, 2008, labor unions represented 84% of Alaska’s and 49% of
Horizon’s employees. Our relations with our labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under this act, collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes
to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is
reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board to appoint a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the National Mediation Board may declare that an impasse exists, at which point the National Mediation Board
offers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If either party rejects arbitration, a 30-day “cooling-off” period commences. During that period, a Presidential Emergency Board may be
established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The Presidential Emergency Board process, if invoked, lasts for 30 days and is followed by another “cooling-off” period of 30 days. At the end of the
applicable “cooling-off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to “self-help,” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed
amendments on the collective bargaining agreements and/or the hiring of workers to replace strikers.

REGULATION

GENERAL

The Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.

•

DOT:

In order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the U.S., a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity
issued by the DOT. Subject to certain individual airport capacity, noise and other restrictions, this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the U.S. Certificates do not expire, but may be revoked for failure to
comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders or the terms of the certificates. In addition,



the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements, alliance agreements between domestic major airlines, international route authorities
and certain consumer protection matters, such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability. International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the U.S.

•

FAA:

The FAA, through Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs), generally regulates all aspects of airline operations, including establishing personnel, maintenance and
flight operation standards. Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA. Pursuant to these regulations we have established, and the FAA has approved, our operations specifications and a
maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate. The maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls. From time to time the FAA issues airworthiness
directives (ADs) that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations. All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs. At this time, we
are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.

The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the Security Act) generally provides for enhanced aviation security measures. Pursuant to the Security Act, the Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for aviation security. The Security Act mandates that the TSA shall provide for the screening of passengers and property, including U.S. mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that
will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft. The TSA performs most of these functions with its own federal employees. The TSA also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain
flights. The Security Act imposes a $2.50

per enplanement security service fee (maximum $5.00 one-way fee), which is collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security
measures. In addition, carriers are required to pay an additional amount to the TSA to cover the cost of providing security measures equal to the amount the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000. We paid $12.6 million each
year to the TSA for this security charge in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

The Department of
Justice has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the
Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements. To the extent we continue to fly
to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers, we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies.

AIRLINE FARES

Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation, and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition. The DOT maintains
authority over international (generally outside of North America) fares, rates and charges. International fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve. Although air carriers are required
to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs, substantial commissions, overrides and discounts given to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and
employee safety and health in the U.S. and

other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990,
the Clean Air Act, the



Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act,
or Superfund Act. We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, OSHA, and other federal agencies have been
authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes. Many state and local governments have
adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. We maintain our own continuing safety, health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements.

The current federal administration will likely move forward in 2009 or 2010 with
legislation to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. We believe legislation will most likely come in the form of a “cap and trade” system, under which companies must purchase credits to emit above a specified cap. We do not
believe legislation is necessary to motivate airlines to reduce fuel burn and, in turn, reduce emissions. For example, Alaska and Horizon have transitioned or are transitioning to more fuel-efficient single-type aircraft fleets, thereby greatly
reducing our total emissions.

The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights
of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have
established aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft. We believe we have sufficient scheduling
flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions.

Although we do not currently
anticipate that these regulatory matters, individually or

collectively, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, new regulations or compliance issues that we do
not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

Along with other domestic airlines, we have implemented a customer service commitment plan to address a number of service goals, including, but not limited to, goals relating to
lowest fare availability, delays, cancellations and diversions, baggage delivery and liability, guaranteed fares and ticket refunds. In 2008, we set a goal of having all of our employees attend our Customer Experience Workshop to enhance our
customer service focus and ultimately improve the experience our customers have when traveling with us.

There has been some discussion of an “airline passenger’s bill of rights” at both the national and state levels. Bills have been introduced in several states, including the state of Washington, that propose to
regulate airlines when operating in those specific states. However, we believe these bills would be preempted by federal law. We do not believe these bills are necessary and if the federal bills were to become law, they could impose additional
economic and resource constraints on our airlines and could negatively impact our financial performance.

MILEAGE PLAN PROGRAM

All major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty. Alaska’s Mileage Plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on Alaska, Horizon and other participating airlines and by using the
services of non-airline partners, which include a credit card partner, a grocery store chain, a telephone company, hotels, car rental agencies, and other businesses. Alaska is paid by non-airline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts.
With advance notice, Alaska has the ability to change the Mileage Plan terms, conditions, partners, mileage credits, and award levels or to terminate the program.



Mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for various other awards. Upon accumulating the necessary mileage, members notify Alaska of their award
selection. Over 75% of the free flight awards on Alaska and Horizon are subject to capacity-controlled seating. Beginning in the third quarter of 2008, Mileage Plan accounts are generally deleted after two years of inactivity in a member’s
account. Prior to that date, accounts were deleted after three years of inactivity. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, Alaska estimated that approximately 4.0 million and 3.7 million, respectively, round-trip flight awards were
eligible for redemption by Mileage Plan members. Of those eligible awards, Alaska estimated that approximately 88% would ultimately be redeemed. For the years 2008 and 2007, approximately 936,000 and 870,000 round-trip awards and 499,000 and 270,000
one-way flight awards were redeemed and flown on Alaska and Horizon. One-way awards were introduced in February 2007. For 2006, approximately 850,000 round-trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on Alaska and Horizon. Those awards represent
approximately 12.4%, 9.7%, and 8.6% for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, of the total passenger miles flown on Alaska and Horizon. For the years 2008, 2007, and 2006, approximately 214,000, 243,200, and 252,600, respectively, round-trip flight
awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners. Effective in November 2008, we began charging a $25 fee for awards redeemed on our airline partners.

For miles earned through travel on Alaska or Horizon and their airline partners, the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards in the future is recognized as a
selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated. The incremental cost of providing award travel on Alaska or Horizon does not include a contribution to overhead, aircraft ownership cost, or profit. Alaska also sells mileage
credits to its non-airline partners. Alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds and recognizes revenue when award transportation is provided on Alaska, Horizon or another partner airline. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred revenue
and the total liability for providing free travel on Alaska and Horizon and for estimated payments to partner airlines was

$690.4 million and $648.5 million, respectively, the majority of which is deferred revenue
from the sale of mileage credits. Excluding the $42.3 million benefit from the change in Mileage Plan account activity terms, revenue attributable to the Mileage Plan was $245.7 million, $227.6 million, and $194.2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

OTHER INFORMATION

SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS

Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the
entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic. It generally increases in the second quarter and typically reaches its
highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel, including increased activity in the state of Alaska.

In addition to passenger loads, factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include:

•

general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand,

•

pricing initiatives by us and our competitors,

•

changes in fuel costs,

•

the timing and amount of maintenance expenditures (both planned and unplanned),

•

increases or decreases in passenger and volume-driven variable costs, and

•

labor actions.

In addition to those factors listed above, seasonal variations in traffic, the timing of various expenditures such as maintenance events and adverse weather conditions may affect our operating results from quarter to quarter.
Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter, causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft, canceled flights and reaccommodation of displaced passengers. Due to our geographic area of operations, we
can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions



(particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest) than some of our competitors, who may be better able to spread weather-related risks over larger route
systems.

No material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon
a single customer, or upon a few high-volume customers.

INSURANCE

We carry Airline Hull, Spares and
Comprehensive Legal Liability Insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to aircraft, spare parts and spare engines, as well as bodily injury and property damage to passengers and third parties.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, this insurance program excludes coverage for War and Allied Perils, including hijacking, terrorism, malicious acts, strikes, riots, civil commotion and other identified perils, so the company has also
purchased war risk coverage for such events through the U.S. government.

Over the last
several years, Alaska Air Group has experienced dramatic reductions in the cost of its Airline Hull, Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability Insurance program through a combination of factors. These factors include a general softening of aviation
insurance market conditions, demonstration of Alaska Air Group’s state-of-the-art safety program to insurers and better alignment with industry rates designed to improve costs and support in the aviation insurance market.

OTHER GOVERNMENT MATTERS

We have elected to participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, whereby we make available to
the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military call-up. The government would reimburse us for the use of such aircraft. Participation in the program is a prerequisite for bidding on various government travel
contracts.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

We have
established an ongoing Risk Analysis and Oversight Program to identify and assign responsibility for the most significant risks facing our company. The results of this program are routinely shared with our Board of Directors. In this section, we
discuss the highest priority issues identified in our risk analysis. If any of the following occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could also decline.
These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such developments, nor can it assess the impact, if any, on our business of
such new risk factors or of events described in any forward-looking statements.

The current economic recession will impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations.

The current economic recession and outlook has resulted in a decline in demand for air travel. Our

passenger count and traffic declined in the
fourth quarter when compared to the prior year periods and we anticipate declines into 2009. We are reducing 2009 capacity at both Alaska and Horizon by 8% and 9%, respectively, when compared to 2008 to help offset this anticipated decline in
passenger traffic, which will likely result in a decline in operating revenues. If demand declines further than expected, it will harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and
otherwise restrict our activities and potentially lead to liquidity constraints.

We have, and will continue to have for the foreseeable future, a significant amount of debt. Due to our high fixed costs, including aircraft lease commitments and debt service, a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater
decrease in earnings. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had approximately $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion of



long-term debt outstanding, respectively, all of which is secured by flight equipment, aircraft purchase rights and real property. In addition to long-term debt, we
have significant other fixed obligations under operating leases related to our aircraft, airport terminal space, other airport facilities and office space. As of December 31, 2008, future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating
leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were approximately $1.0 billion for 2009 through 2013 and an aggregate of approximately $400 million for the years thereafter.

At December 31, 2008, we had firm orders to purchase 33 aircraft requiring future aggregate payments of $753.4 million through 2011. Although we
have secured financing for all of the firm Q400 commitments, there is no guarantee that additional financing will be available for our other aircraft deliveries when required or that the terms will be acceptable to us. The current market conditions
could result in a lack of availability or higher interest rates for financing of aircraft purchases, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our outstanding long-term debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences. For example, they could:

•

limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital or other purposes;

•

require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other
purposes; and

•

limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including reacting to the current
economic slowdown.

We cannot ensure that we will be able to generate
sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due. If we fail to do so, our business could be harmed.

Alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements. We cannot be certain now that Alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions
or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs.

Our failure to successfully reduce unit costs at both Alaska and Horizon could harm our business.

We continue to strive toward aggressive cost-reduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares
while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital. We believe having a lower cost structure better positions us to be able to fund future growth and take advantage of market opportunities, if economic conditions allow. However, with
our planned capacity reductions, we will see upward pressure on unit costs, at least in the near term. Furthermore, if Horizon is unable to successfully transition to an all-Q400 fleet, it will be more difficult to reach our unit cost goals as the
remaining Q200 and CRJ-700 aircraft are more costly to operate on a per-unit basis. If we are unable to further reduce our non-fuel unit costs over the long-term and achieve targeted profitability, we will likely not be able to grow our business in
the future and therefore our financial results may suffer.

Our business, financial
condition, and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business.

Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses, accounting for 36% and 27% of total operating expenses for the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Significant increases in average fuel costs during the past several years have negatively affected our results of operations. Although prices have declined sharply over the past six months, prices
are still substantially higher than they were earlier in this decade. Future increases in the price of jet fuel will harm our financial condition and results of operations, unless we are able to increase fares or add additional ancillary fees to
attempt to recover increasing fuel costs.



Historically, fuel costs and availability have been unpredictable and subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand. It is
often difficult to increase fares to offset increases in the price of fuel and although we had some success recently, we may not be able to do so in the future.

We utilize fuel hedges as a form of insurance against the volatility of fuel prices. To manage the risk of fuel price increases, we primarily purchase call options that are
designed to cap a portion of our fuel costs at designated per-barrel oil prices. Even with hedges, we are substantially and increasingly exposed to increases in jet fuel costs as the average price at which we are hedged in future periods is higher
than it has historically been.

The airline industry is highly competitive and
subject to rapid change. We may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs, or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the nature of competition in our markets changes.

The airline industry is highly competitive as to fares, flight frequency, frequent
flyer benefits, routes and service. The industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Over the past few years, airlines have
reduced domestic routes and the number of planes available, which has resulted in reduced domestic industry capacity and a trend towards increased fares. Although capacity has declined based on a nationwide average, capacity on the West Coast has
not declined to the same degree due to increased competition from new market entrants. If airlines decide to increase their capacity in the future, this could cause fares to decline, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Many of our competitors are larger than we are and therefore, may have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than we do. In addition, competitors who have successfully reorganized out of bankruptcy
have lowered their operating costs as a result of

renegotiated labor, supply and financing agreements. From time to time in the past, some of these competitors have chosen to add service, reduce their fares, or
take other competitive steps in our key markets. We may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve.

The airline industry, and particularly regional airlines like Horizon, also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives, such as buses,
trains or automobiles. Increased use of technology such as video conferencing and internet-based meeting tools have also resulted in a change in business travel, especially in short-haul markets like those that Horizon serves.

A significant increase in labor costs or change in key personnel could adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

We compete against the major U.S. airlines
and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions. If we are unable to hire, train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost, or if we lose the services of key personnel, we may be unable to grow or sustain our business. In
such case, our operating results and business prospects could be harmed. We may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and, therefore, the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business.

Labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses, accounting for approximately 25% and 30%
of our total operating expenses in 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, labor unions represented approximately 84% of Alaska’s and 49% of Horizon’s employees. Each of our represented employee groups has a separate
collective bargaining agreement, and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them. Uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction to many employees, reduce
employee engagement in our business and divert management’s attention from other projects and issues. Disengaged



employees could prevent us from achieving the operational improvements in completion rate and on-time performance that we seek.

In 2005, Alaska and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) were unable to reach a new agreement, and
therefore, pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement that existed at the time, the parties submitted the agreement to binding arbitration. That arbitration decision, which was effective May 1, 2005, resulted in an average
pilot wage reduction of 26%. That contract became amendable on May 1, 2007, and Alaska has been in negotiations with ALPA. In 2008, ALPA requested mediation from the National Mediation Board (NMB) in order to assist with contract negotiations.
We have begun meeting with the NMB and hope to reach a negotiated contract that recognizes the important contributions that our pilots make while not harming our competitive position. Horizon is also in negotiations with the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters on a new pilot agreement. The Horizon pilot contract became amendable in September 2006. Factoring in pay rates, productivity measures, and pension and postretirement medical benefits, we believe our pilot unit costs at both
Alaska and Horizon are among the highest in the industry for the size of aircraft we operate.

Our continuing obligation to fund our traditional defined-benefit pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace. This is because most of our competitors either have eliminated such obligations through
bankruptcy or have never had traditional pension plans in place. Currently, all of our defined-benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants, with the exception of the plan covering Alaska’s pilots.

Our defined-benefit pension plan assets are subject to market risk. If market returns are poor in the
future, as they were in 2008, our obligation to make additional cash contributions in accordance with the Pension Plan Act of 2006 could increase and harm our liquidity. Poor market returns also lead to higher pension expense in our statement of
operations. The calculation of pension expense is dependent on

many assumptions that are more fully described in “Critical Accounting Estimates” on page 52 and Note 8 to our consolidated
financial statements.

Finally, to the extent we are unable to maintain the outsourcing
or subcontracting of certain services for our business, we would incur substantial costs, including costs associated with hiring new employees, in order to perform these services in-house.

Our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control, including delays, cancellations and other conditions, which could harm our
financial condition and results of operations.

Like other airlines, our
operations often are affected by delays, cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control, including:

•

air traffic congestion at airports or other air traffic control problems;

•

adverse weather conditions;

•

increased security measures or breaches in security; and

•

international or domestic conflicts, terrorist activity, or other changes in business conditions.

Delays and cancellations frustrate passengers, reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs, all of
which affect our profitability. Due to our geographic area of operations, we believe a significant portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than that of many of our competitors. A general reduction in airline
passenger traffic as a result of any of the above-mentioned factors could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We depend on a few key markets to be successful.

Our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets, including Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles and Anchorage. A significant portion of our flights occurs to and from our Seattle
hub. In 2008, passengers to and from Seattle accounted for 62% of our total passengers.



We believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel, aircraft, and
ground facilities, as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions. As a result, we remain highly dependent on our key markets. Our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand
for air transportation in our key markets. An increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath negatively
affected the airline industry, including our company. These attacks and other foiled terror plots since then have resulted in new security measures that also impacted our company. Additional terrorist attacks, the fear of such attacks or other
hostilities involving the U.S. could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry, including us, and could:

•

significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a potentially dramatic drop in demand for air travel;

•

significantly increase security and insurance costs;

•

make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive;

•

increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices;

•

increase costs from airport shutdowns, flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats; and

•

result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA.

The occurrence of any of these events would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

With respect to the availability of commercial War and Allied Perils Insurance,
world events or events involving our company could result in sudden market volatility resulting in cancellation and/or a material change in the availability or cost of the coverage which could adversely affect ongoing operations or results. Further,
commercial War and Allied Perils Insurance now excludes certain catastrophic perils not previously excluded for weapons of mass destruction (such as chemical, biological or nuclear devices). The commercial policies also contain low aggregate
sublimits, which do not adequately address potential catastrophic third-party war and allied perils exposures. In the event we were to be required to rely on the commercial insurance market, expensive excess limits would likely need to be explored
in an equally volatile excess specialty market. It remains, therefore, our position to retain our coverage for this aspect of the insurance program directly through the U.S. government’s FAA premium war risk insurance program, rather than
procure it from the commercial market.

Although our insurance costs have declined
significantly, aviation insurers could increase their premiums again in the event of additional terrorist attacks, hijackings, airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry. Furthermore, the full hull and liability war
risk insurance provided by the government is currently mandated through March 31, 2009. Although the government may extend the deadline for providing such coverage, we cannot be certain that any extension will occur, or if it does, for how long
the extension will last. It is expected that, should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry, the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by
the government and the coverage will be much more limited, including smaller aggregate limits and shorter cancellation periods. Significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.



Our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident.

An accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and
result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public. In addition, we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives, as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft
and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service. Although we strive to maintain the highest standards of safety and reliability, should an accident or incident nevertheless occur, we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the
type generally consistent with industry practice. However, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related
insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines, could cause a public perception that our airlines or the
equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives, which would harm our business.

We rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business, and a failure of these systems or by their operators could harm our business.

We depend on automated systems to operate our business, including our computerized airline reservation
system, our telecommunication systems, our website, our maintenance systems, and other systems. Substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets. We depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue,
track and accept these electronic tickets. In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information, and deliver important flight
information. Substantial or repeated website, reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness

of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another
airline. In addition, we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling, flight dispatch, and other operational needs. Disruption in, changes to, or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data, an increase of our
expenses and a possible temporary cessation of our operations.

We rely on partner
airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements.

Alaska and
Horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers, or “partners,” including but not limited to American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines. These
agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as Alaska codeshare flights. In addition, the agreements generally provide
that members of Alaska’s Mileage Plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa. We receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under codeshare arrangements. In addition, we believe that the
frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our Mileage Plan program. The loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our Mileage Plan, which we believe is a
source of competitive advantage.

We rely on third-party vendors for certain
critical activities.

We have historically relied on outside vendors for a
variety of services and functions critical to our business, including airframe and engine maintenance, ground handling, fueling, computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance. As part of our cost-reduction efforts, our reliance on
outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future. In recent years, Alaska has subcontracted its heavy aircraft maintenance, fleet service, facilities maintenance, and ground handling services at certain airports, including
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, to outside vendors.



Our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks. In the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operation or fails to perform as
promised, replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates, or at all. Although we believe that our vendor oversight and quality control is among the best in the industry, if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we
may experience increased costs, delays, maintenance issues, safety issues or negative public perception of our airline. Vendor bankruptcies, unionization, regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among
suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force Alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms. These events could result in disruptions in Alaska’s operations or increases in its cost structure.

We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts.

Alaska is dependent on Boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many of its aircraft parts.
Horizon is similarly dependent on Bombardier. Additionally, each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines. As a result, we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts, including
design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the manufacturers, or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft.

Changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our
operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions.

Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements, both domestically and internationally, that involve significant compliance costs. In the last several years,

Congress has passed laws, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) have issued regulations that have
required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines. For example, the FAA has issued regulations covering, among other things, security measures, collision avoidance systems, noise abatement, environmental
restrictions, safety procedures and maintenance regulations. Similarly, many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting the environment.

Because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since September 11,
2001, many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers. Additional laws, regulations, taxes, and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or
reduce the demand for air travel. Although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “pass-through” costs, we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result
in an overall decline in passenger traffic, which would harm our business.

The
market price of our common stock may be volatile.

The market price of our stock
can be influenced by many factors, a number of which are outside of our control, including those discussed above. Some of the primary factors in the volatility of our stock price are:

•

our actual or anticipated financial performance;

•

the price of crude oil;

•

the overall financial performance of the industry; and

•

other industry, macro or geopolitical factors.

Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” discusses future orders and options for additional
aircraft.

As of December 31, 2008, 59 of the 75 aircraft owned by Alaska and three
of the 22 aircraft owned by Horizon are subject to liens securing long-term debt, and the majority of the other owned Alaska aircraft serve as collateral for our $185 million line-of-credit facility. Alaska’s leased 737-400, 737-700, and
737-800 aircraft have lease expiration dates between 2009 and 2016, between 2009 and 2010, and between

2015 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, Alaska has four MD-80 aircraft under long-term lease arrangements
through 2012 that are currently in temporary storage. Horizon’s leased Q200, Q400 and CRJ-700 aircraft have expiration dates in 2012, in 2018, and between 2018 and 2020, respectively. Alaska and Horizon have the option to extend most of the
leases for additional periods, or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, usually at the then-fair-market value of the aircraft.

Alaska completed its transition to an all-Boeing fleet during 2008. Horizon continues to progress in its plan to transition to an all-Q400 fleet as quickly and efficiently as
possible, depending on the ability to successfully market the CRJ-700 aircraft.

Giving
consideration to these fleet transition plans and Alaska’s plan to sell up to four B737-700 aircraft in 2009, the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet counts for Alaska and Horizon as of the end of each quarter in 2009. The
Horizon fleet totals are fluid given the CRJ-700 remarketing efforts and are likely to change.

GROUND FACILITIES AND SERVICES

Alaska and Horizon lease ticket counters, gates, cargo and baggage space, office space, and other support areas at the majority of the airports they
serve. Alaska also owns terminal buildings in various cities in the state of Alaska.

Alaska has centralized operations in several buildings located at or near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) near Seattle, Washington. These include a five-bay hangar and shops complex (used primarily for line maintenance), a
flight operations and training center, an air cargo facility, an information technology office and mainframe computer facility, an office building, and corporate headquarters complex. Alaska also leases a

stores
warehouse, and office spaces for a reservation facility and for various administrative functions in Kent, Washington. Alaska’s major facilities outside of Seattle include a regional headquarters building, an air cargo facility and a
hangar/office facility in Anchorage, as well as leased reservations facilities in Phoenix, Arizona and Boise, Idaho. Alaska uses its own employees for ground handling services at most of our airports in the state of Alaska. At other airports
throughout our system, those services are contracted to various third-party vendors.

Horizon owns its Seattle corporate headquarters building. It leases an operations, training, and aircraft maintenance facility in Portland as well as line maintenance stations in Boise, Spokane, Pasco, Los Angeles and Seattle.

ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

Grievance with International Association of Machinists

In June 2005, the International Association of Machinists (IAM) filed a grievance under its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with Alaska alleging that Alaska violated the CBA by, among other things, subcontracting the ramp service
operation in Seattle. The dispute was referred to an arbitrator and hearings on the grievance commenced in January 2007, with a final hearing date in August 2007. In August 2008, the arbitrator issued a ruling in the matter. In that ruling, the
arbitrator found that Alaska had violated the CBA and instructed Alaska and the IAM to negotiate a remedy. The parties have met, but the matter has not yet been resolved. Another arbitration hearing has been tentatively set for June 2009. Management
currently does not believe that any final remedy

will materially impact our financial position or results of operations.

Other items

The Company is a party to routine litigation matters incidental to its business and with respect to which no material liability is expected.

Management believes the ultimate disposition of any of the matters discussed above is not likely to
materially affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. This forward-looking statement is based on management’s current understanding of the relevant law and facts, and it is subject to various contingencies, including
the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of arbitrators, judges and juries.

•

Results of Operations

—an in-depth analysis of the results of operations of Alaska and Horizon for the three years presented in our consolidated financial
statements. We believe this analysis will help the reader better understand our consolidated statements of operations. Financial and statistical data for Alaska and Horizon are also included here. This section includes forward-looking statements
regarding our view of 2009.

overview of financial position and the impact of inflation and changing prices.

YEAR IN REVIEW

In 2008, we reported a
consolidated net loss of $135.9 million compared to a consolidated net income of $124.3 million in 2007. The largest driver of the decline in results was fuel expense. Our fuel expense increased by $522.1 million over 2007, primarily as a result of
the significantly higher average fuel prices in 2008. Oil prices reached record levels during the summer months, but declined sharply in the last few months of 2008. Even with the benefit of $122.7 million of net cash settlements from our fuel hedge
program during the year, our “economic” fuel cost (as defined on page 39) increased $277.6 million, or 30%, on a 4.4% decline in fuel gallons consumed. This increase in fuel expense far exceeded the $156.6 million increase in total
operating revenues. We also had the following notable items during 2008:

•

revenue of $42.3 million associated with the change in Mileage Plan terms to delete accounts that have had no activity for two or more years. Previously, accounts could
remain inactive for three years prior to deletion.

•

fleet transition costs of $71.2 million compared to $14.1 million in 2007.

•

restructuring charges of $12.9 million associated with reductions in work force.

The revenue environment in 2008 was characterized by increased competition in our West Coast market and softer demand in the last half of the year due
to the current economic recession. Yield at both companies improved over 2007 as we and other carriers added or increased ancillary fees and raised fares to cover higher fuel costs. Alaska posted slightly higher passenger traffic for the full year
and Horizon posted a sharp decline in passenger traffic. All of these factors, along with a one-time $42.3 million benefit from changes in our Mileage Plan program, resulted in an increase in total consolidated operating revenues of $156.6 million.



Our total operating expenses increased by $539.7 million during 2008 compared to 2007, primarily as a result of the significant
increase in fuel costs along with an increase in fleet transition costs and restructuring charges. This increase is offset by declines in non-fuel operating costs at both companies as we continued to make progress in our cost reduction efforts. See
“Results of Operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses for both Alaska and Horizon.

Accomplishments and Highlights

Accomplishments and highlights from 2008 include:

•

Alaska and Horizon both improved their operational performance in 2008 as measured by on-time arrivals and completion rate. For the full year, Alaska reported an on-time
performance and completion rate of 78.3% and 99.2%, respectively, compared to 72.4% and 99.0%, respectively, for 2007. Similarly, Horizon reported a 2008 on-time performance and completion rate of 83.1% and 97.9%, respectively, compared to 80.7% and
97.6% in 2007.

•

Alaska received the J.D. Power and Associates “Highest Customer Satisfaction” award in 2008 among North America Airlines in a tie with Continental Airlines.

•

Alaska won the 2007 “Program of the Year” Freddie award for our Mileage Plan program in 2008.

•

We reached an enhanced long-term agreement with Delta that will benefit our customers as it makes us Delta’s preferred partner on the West Coast. Other benefits include
enhanced frequent flyer and lounge reciprocity agreements.

•

We completed our “Airport of the Future” at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, reducing customer wait times significantly.

•

The cargo business generated over $100 million of consolidated revenue for the first time in 2008.

Alaska Fleet Transition

We completed our transition to an all-B737 fleet in 2008 as our final MD-80 aircraft were removed from
service during the year. We now have one of the youngest, most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry.

We have four MD-80 aircraft under long-term lease arrangements that were retired prior to the end of their lease terms and placed in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility. As a result of their grounding, we recorded
a $47.5 million charge during 2008 associated with these aircraft representing the remaining obligation under the existing lease contracts.

Horizon Fleet Transition

Horizon is in the process of transitioning to an all-Q400 fleet and expects to complete the transition as soon as the CRJ-700 fleet is successfully remarketed. At the beginning of
2008, we had 17 Q200s in the fleet, of which we were able to remarket all but six through sublease agreements or arranged sales of the aircraft to third parties. The total charge during 2008 related to the removal of these aircraft from operation
was $10.2 million, which represents the estimated sublease loss for five aircraft delivered under the sublease arrangement and the loss on the termination of the underlying leases of six additional aircraft. Although we removed all remaining Q200
aircraft from scheduled operations as of the end of 2008, six of the aircraft were used as spares through the end of January 2009. We are actively remarketing these remaining aircraft. We do not currently know the timing or amount of any associated
charge.

In the first quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved the plan to remove
our CRJ-700 fleet from operations, in addition to the Q200 transition described above. As a result of the decision, the Company determined that its two owned CRJ-700s were impaired and recorded an impairment charge on the aircraft and their related
spare parts of $5.5 million in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value. Additionally, during 2008, we recorded severance charges of $1.3 million



related to this fleet transition. We are currently evaluating various alternatives to dispose of our CRJ-700 aircraft in the most economically feasible way. Two of our
18 leased aircraft were subleased to a third party during the fourth quarter, resulting in an estimated sublease loss of $6.7 million. The current economic conditions are hindering the remarketing effort and could result in further delays of the
timeline to transition completely to an all-Q400 fleet. As such, the nature, timing or amount of any potential gain or loss associated with transactions on the remaining aircraft cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Fuel Hedging

We utilize primarily crude oil call options to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel
prices, although we do have some collar structures that are scheduled to settle in 2009. The total outstanding liability for the collar contracts at December 31, 2008 is approximately $24 million, and we currently do not have any collateral on
deposit with counterparties to these agreements. With call option contracts, we benefit from the decline in crude oil prices, as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums that we pay to enter into the contracts.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we restructured our hedge portfolio to take advantage of lower fuel
prices. We were able to reduce our 2009 average strike price from $103 per barrel at the end of the third quarter of 2008 to $76 per barrel for 50% of the planned 2009 consumption. As part of this restructuring effort, we terminated some of the
previously held contracts. We realized losses on the termination of these contracts of $41.5 million and $8.5 million at Alaska and Horizon, respectively, representing the difference between the original premiums paid to purchase those contracts and
the cash received from the counterparty upon termination. We believe that restructuring the hedge portfolio was a wise use of our resources and consistent with our stated objective of managing volatility.

Operational Performance

Our core promise to our customers is to get them and their bags to their destinations safely and on
time. Operational performance was a top initiative in 2008 and we believe we made significant progress during the year. For 2008, Alaska and Horizon both exceeded their prior-year performance in on-time arrivals and in schedule completion rates. As
a result of the current-year performance, our employees received higher payouts under our Operational Performance Rewards program.

Fees and Mileage Plan Changes

Like many of our competitors, we have increased existing fees or implemented new fees in an effort to increase our revenues. Examples include:

•

increasing the charge for booking through reservations and airport sales agents from $10 to $15,

•

raising the fee for overweight baggage from $25 to $50,

•

increasing the charge for transporting pets in the cabin from $75 to $100 one-way, and

•

raising the unaccompanied minor fee from $30 to $75 for one-way nonstop flights and from $60 to $75 for connecting flights.

The increases above were effective May 21, 2008. We also began charging $25 for a second checked
bag effective July 1, 2008. First class and top-tier Mileage Plan members and customers on flights within the state of Alaska are exempt from the new fee.

On July 24, 2008 we announced a $25 fee for booking Mileage Plan award travel on partner airlines. We also announced that our domestic round-trip “Coach Saver”
award will increase to 25,000 miles from 20,000 miles, and we have expanded our 15,000-mile “Intra-Alaska” award levels in coach to an “Intra-State” award. This award offers travel wholly within one state for 15,000 award miles.
Other changes include an increase in the award miles needed for “Peak” awards and the introduction of a three-tier award level structure. All of these changes are effective for awards redeemed on or after November 19, 2008.



Additionally, beginning in August 2008, we reduced from three years to two years the length of time that a Mileage Plan account could be inactive before the account is
deleted. As a result of this change in terms, our Mileage Plan liability was reduced by $42.3 million. This benefit is recorded separately in operating revenues as “Change in Mileage Plan terms.”

Update on Labor Negotiations

Alaska is currently in negotiations with its pilots and has been since early 2007. The contract with
Alaska’s pilots became amendable on May 1, 2007. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) at Alaska has requested mediation from the National Mediation Board (NMB) in order to assist with contract negotiations. We have begun meeting with the
NMB and hope to reach a negotiated contract that recognizes the important contributions that our pilots make while not harming our competitive position. Factoring in pay rates, productivity measures, pension, and post-retirement medical benefits, we
believe our pilot unit costs are among the highest in the industry for the size of aircraft operated.

Alaska and the Association of Flight Attendants have reached a tentative agreement to extend the current contract with Alaska’s flight attendants by two years. The current agreement becomes amendable on May 1, 2010.
Horizon is currently in negotiations with the following work groups – pilots, flight attendants, technicians and dispatchers.

We do not know what the final outcome of these negotiations will be or when agreements will be reached. However, uncertainty around open contracts could distract some employees,
reduce employee engagement in our business, and prevent us from achieving the operational goals (such as on-time and completion-rate targets) that we have set.

Common Stock Repurchase

In September 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock over a twelve-month period. We completed the repurchase in
February 2008 buying back 4.1 million shares of

our outstanding common stock, or 10% of the outstanding stock at the start of the program, at an average price of $24.31 per share. During the first quarter of
2008, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for approximately $37.2 million. On March 13, 2008, we announced a new $50 million common stock repurchase program. Through April 24, 2008, we had repurchased 605,700 shares of our common stock
for approximately $11.7 million under this new program. The repurchased shares have been recorded as treasury shares in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

We temporarily stopped further repurchases under this program given the uncertainty in the economic environment and currently do not expect to
repurchase any more shares prior to the expiration date in March 2009.

Line of Credit Modification

Alaska has a $185 million
variable-rate credit facility that expires in March 2010. In the fourth quarter we borrowed $75 million from this facility and that amount was outstanding at December 31, 2008. On September 24, 2008, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to
our $185 million variable-rate credit facility that eliminated all previous financial covenants and replaced them with a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance of $500 million.

Outlook

As we look forward to 2009, the two primary uncertainties are the demand environment and fuel prices. Although fuel prices have declined significantly
since their record high in July 2008, the global financial instability and economic recession have put downward pressure on demand for air travel.

Traffic was down by 4.4% and 22.4% at Alaska and Horizon, respectively, in the fourth quarter as the economic recession began to take its toll on travel behaviors of our customers.
In anticipation of this decline in demand, the Alaska and Horizon reduced capacity by 7.1% and 21.1%, respectively, in the fourth quarter. We currently anticipate further capacity



reductions of 8% at Alaska and 9% at Horizon in 2009 compared with 2008. We believe the actions we are taking to reduce capacity are necessary and appropriate given
the uncertainty in the demand outlook, although we do have the flexibility to adjust our capacity throughout the year to stay aligned with demand.

Oil prices have declined from a record $147 per barrel in July to approximately $40 to $45 per barrel recently. That translates to a significant reduction in fuel cost for Air
Group, although prices are still above historical levels. In July 2008, our average raw, unhedged price of jet fuel per gallon was $4.19 and is currently around $1.60 per gallon. Oil prices continue to be volatile, however, and prices could rise
again. We continue to execute our hedging strategy to help remove some of the impact of that volatility on our financial results.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

Our consolidated net loss for 2008 was $135.9 million, or $3.74 per share, compared to net income of $124.3 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, in 2007. Both periods include gains
and losses arising from fuel-hedging activities. In 2008, there were several other items, as noted below, that affect the comparability between the two years:

•

restructuring charges of $12.9 million ($8.1 million after tax, or $0.22 per share) related to the reduction in work force at Alaska;

•

fleet transition charges of $61.0 million ($38.2 million after tax, or $1.05 per share) related to the ongoing transitions out of the MD-80 and CRJ-700 fleets; and

•

a $42.3 million benefit ($26.5 million after tax, or $0.73 per share) related to a change in the terms of our Mileage Plan program.

We believe disclosure of the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors
because:

•

it is useful to monitor performance without these items as it improves a reader’s ability to compare our results to other airlines;

•

our results excluding these adjustments related to fuel hedge accounting and other items serve as the basis for our various employee incentive plans, thus the information
allows investors to better understand the changes in variable incentive pay expense in our consolidated statements of operations;

•

our results excluding these items are most often used in internal management and board reporting and decision-making; and

•

we believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts.

Our consolidated results are primarily driven by the results of our two operating carriers. Alaska and Horizon reported pretax losses of $153.3 million and $55.8
million, respectively, in 2008. Financial and statistical data for Alaska and Horizon are shown on pages 34 and 35, respectively. An in-depth discussion of the results of Alaska and Horizon begins on page 36.

additional line of business information.



ALASKA AIRLINES

Alaska reported a loss before income taxes of $153.3 million during 2008 compared to income before income taxes of $215.0 million in 2007. The $368.3
million difference between the periods is primarily due to the $424.9 million increase in aircraft fuel expense (including hedging gains and losses) compared to the prior period, $47.5 million of fleet transition costs, and $12.9 million of
restructuring charges partially offset by a $151.4 million increase in operating revenues.

ALASKA REVENUES

Total operating revenues increased $151.4 million, or 4.9%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The
components of Alaska’s revenue are summarized in the following table:

NM

= Not Meaningful

Operating Revenue—Mainline

Mainline passenger revenue for
the full year increased 3.8% on flat capacity and a 3.7% increase in passenger revenues per available seat mile (PRASM). The increase in mainline PRASM was the result of a 2.3% increase in yields and a 1.1-point increase in load factor compared to
the prior-year period. An increase in Mileage Plan redemption revenue and higher ancillary fee revenue contributed significantly to the increase in yields compared to 2007. Although capacity and traffic were relatively flat, traffic declined in the
third and fourth quarters as the economic recession deepened. In response, we reduced capacity, with the most significant reductions taking place in the fourth quarter.



Our advance bookings currently suggest that load factors will be relatively flat in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, although that is
with a 10% to 11% decline in capacity.

Freight and mail revenues increased $5.1 million,
or 5.4%, over 2007. The increase is due to increased yields for freight and mail and freight fuel surcharges, partially offset by a decline in freight volumes compared to the prior year. As fuel prices decline, fuel surcharge revenue is also
expected to decline in 2009.

Other—net revenues declined $11.9 million, or 8.1%,
primarily as a result of lower commission revenue on the sale of Mileage Plan miles to our non-airline partners. We anticipate lower sales of miles to our affinity card partner in 2009 as general consumer credit card spending declines due to the
economic recession.

Change in Mileage Plan Terms

Beginning in August 2008, we reduced the length of time that a Mileage Plan account could be inactive
from three years to two years before the account is deleted. As a result of this change in terms, our Mileage Plan liability was reduced by $42.3 million. This benefit is recorded separately in operating revenues as “Change in Mileage Plan
terms.”

Passenger Revenue—Purchased Capacity

Passenger revenue—purchased capacity increased by $19.4 million over the same period in 2007
because of a 5.7% increase in unit revenues on relatively flat capacity. Unit revenues have increased due to a 6.8% increase in yields, offset by a 0.7-point decline in load factors compared to 2007.

ALASKA EXPENSES

For the year, total operating expenses increased $494.1 million, or 17.3%, compared to 2007 as a result of higher mainline operating costs, most
notably aircraft fuel expense (including hedging gains and losses), fleet transition charges and restructuring charges. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is

consistent with
the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management.

Mainline Operating Expenses

Significant mainline operating expense variances are described below.

Along with our financial and statistical data on page 34, we are presenting here
our line-item expenses on a per-ASM basis (in cents). We believe this information is useful to investors because it highlights areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity:



Additional line item information is provided below.

Wages and Benefits

Wages and benefits decreased during the full year of 2008 by $11.2 million, or 1.5%, primarily as a result of lower defined-benefit pension costs, overtime, and a 0.5% decrease in
full-time equivalent employees compared to 2007.

We currently expect wages and benefits
to be flat in 2009 but to increase on a per-ASM basis. Although we expect a significant decline in full-time equivalent employees resulting from the recent reduction in work force, our defined-benefit pension costs are increasing substantially from
$48 million in 2008 to an estimated $93 million next year because of poor market returns in 2008. This expectation is exclusive of any potential change in pilot wages that may result from our current contract negotiations.

Variable Incentive Pay

Variable incentive pay for 2008 increased $2.3 million or 17.0%, compared to 2007. The increase is
primarily due to higher payouts under our Operational Performance Reward program, offset by lower overall payouts in our profit-sharing plans due to the decline in profitability from 2007. For our incentive pay plans, profit is generally defined as
results excluding fleet transition costs, restructuring charges, and other amounts specified in the various incentive plan documents and with fuel stated on an economic basis. Air Group maintains several incentive plans that collectively cover all
of our employees and create alignment for employees, customers and shareholders. These plans include both operational and financial performance metrics that, to a large extent, are based on certain annual financial targets.

Aircraft Fuel

Aircraft fuel expense includes both

raw fuel expense

(as defined below) plus the effect of
mark-to-market adjustments to our portfolio of hedges included in our income statement as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or
losses in the value of the underlying

instruments as crude oil prices increase or decrease.

Raw fuel expense

is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the “into-plane” price,
including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges.

Aircraft fuel expense increased $424.9 million, or 57.6%, compared to 2007. The elements of the
change are illustrated in the following table:

NM

= Not meaningful

Fuel gallons consumed decreased 5.8% due to the decrease in capacity and the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we completed the fleet transition out of the less-efficient MD-80 aircraft to newer, more-efficient B737-800 aircraft on
relatively flat capacity for the year. Because the B737-800 aircraft are larger than the MD-80s, the flat capacity came on a 2.6% decline in revenue block hours.

The raw fuel price per gallon increased by 42.1% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs for much of the
year. Crude oil prices have declined dramatically since the record high set in July 2008. Based on the current price of jet fuel, we expect that the raw fuel price per gallon in the first quarter of 2009 will be significantly lower than in the same
period of 2008.

During 2008, we recorded significant mark-to-market losses reflecting a
steep decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio as fuel



prices declined sharply late in the year. During 2007, we recorded mark-to-market gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. Our hedge portfolio consists primarily of call options that are based on the price of crude oil.

We also evaluate

economic fuel expense

, which we define as

raw fuel expense

less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the
period under their original contract expiration terms, offset by the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between

aircraft fuel expense

and

economic fuel expense

is the timing of gain or loss recognition
on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to

economic fuel expense

, we include gains only when they are realized through a cash receipt from our hedge contract counterparties for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their
original contract settlement terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations.
Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans.

Our

economic fuel expense

is calculated as follows:

NM

= Not meaningful

The total net cash benefit from hedges that settled during 2008, excluding hedges that were terminated early, increased by $56.9 million to $101.8 million compared to 2007. This increase was primarily due to the record high crude oil prices
during the year.

As part of our effort to restructure our fuel-hedge portfolio as noted
earlier, we terminated a number of contracts originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010 and replaced them with new positions having lower average strike prices. As a result, we realized losses of approximately $41.5 million, representing the
difference between the original premiums paid for those contracts when purchased and the amount of cash received from the counterparty on termination of the contracts. We do not anticipate further restructuring of the portfolio at this time. Based
on current jet fuel prices, we expect our

economic fuel expense

to be lower in 2009 than in 2008 because of lower crude oil prices.

Aircraft Rent

Aircraft rent declined by $6.6 million, or 5.9% during 2008, because of the retirement of all remaining leased MD-80 aircraft, offset by one additional leased B737-800 aircraft
since 2007. We expect aircraft rent will be flat to slightly higher in 2009 as the elimination of the MD-80 rent is offset by lease expense on B737-800 aircraft as we plan to finance six aircraft with sale-leaseback transactions.

Landing Fees and Other Rents

Landing fees and other rents declined by $2.4 million, or 1.4%, compared to 2007. The decline is
primarily attributable to the decline in departures resulting in lower landing fees across the system. However, looking forward into 2009, even though we are expecting capacity and departure declines, airport costs may not decline ratably. Airport
costs are generally spread across the airlines based on passenger counts and departures. As the industry cuts capacity, airport costs on a per-passenger or per-departure basis will likely increase.



Contracted Services

During 2008, contracted services increased by $6.1 million, or 4.9%, compared to 2007. This is primarily due to efforts to improve our operational performance and the introduction
of new stations in our route system where we contract airport services. We expect contracted services to decline approximately 5% in 2009 as we decrease our departures across the system and require less handling at airports.

Selling Expenses

Selling expenses declined $13.3 million, or 10.3%, compared to 2007. The decline is driven by lower
ticket distribution fees and lower expenses associated with our Mileage Plan program. We expect selling expenses to increase slightly in 2009 primarily driven by increases in our advertising and marketing efforts tied to our initiative to increase
unit revenues.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased $23.6 million, or 16.6%, compared to 2007 as a result of
the delivery of 11 B737-800 aircraft delivered in 2008. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about flat in 2009. Although we took delivery of 11 new aircraft in 2008 and expect ten more in 2009, we expect to sell up to four B737-700
aircraft and complete sale-leaseback transactions for six B737-800s.

Other Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses
increased primarily because of higher personnel and crew costs, property taxes, and legal fees, partially offset by a decline in passenger remuneration costs stemming from our improved operational performance.

Restructuring Charges and Fleet Transition Costs

In the third quarter of 2008, we announced reductions in work force among union and non-union
employees. The non-union employees that were affected by the reduction were terminated in the third quarter, resulting in a $1.6 million severance charge. For union

personnel, we offered extended leaves, a
voluntary furlough program, and an early-out package with a lump-sum payment based on years of service that included continuation of medical coverage and travel privileges for a specified period. In addition to the voluntary offers, there have been
involuntary furloughs to achieve the target reduction in work force. We recorded an $11.3 million charge in 2008 representing the severance payments and estimated medical coverage obligation for the affected union employees.

During 2008, we retired four MD-80 aircraft that were under long-term lease arrangements and placed
them in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility. The $47.5 million charge in the period represents the remaining lease payments under the lease contract and our estimate of maintenance costs that will be incurred in the future to meet the
minimum return conditions under the lease requirements.

Mainline
Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM)

Operating costs per ASM (CASM)
is an important metric in the industry, and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost-reduction efforts. Our effort to reduce unit costs focuses not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend, but also on increasing our capacity without
adding a commensurate amount of cost.

Our mainline operating costs per mainline ASM are
summarized below:

NM

= Not meaningful



We have separately listed in the above table our fuel costs, restructuring charges and fleet transition costs per ASM. These amounts are included in CASM, but for
internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and certain special items to measure our cost-reduction progress. We believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements
for the following reasons:

•

By eliminating fuel expense and other special items from our unit cost metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of our non-fuel cost-reduction
initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic
carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity,
airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management.

•

Mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel and certain special items is one of the most important measures used by managements of both Alaska and Horizon and by the Air Group Board
of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. For Alaska Airlines, these decision-makers evaluate operating results of the “mainline” operation, which includes the operation of the B737 fleet branded in Alaska Airlines
livery. The revenues and expenses associated with purchased capacity are evaluated separately.

•

Mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel, fleet transition charges and restructuring charges (and other items as specified in our plan documents) is an important metric for the
employee incentive plan that covers company management and executives.

•

Mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel and other special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it

is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors.

•

Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We
believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as fleet transition costs and restructuring charges, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry
analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines.

•

Although we disclose our “mainline” passenger unit revenues for Alaska, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate mainline unit revenues excluding the impact that
rising fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Economic fuel cost represents approximately 35% of our total mainline operating expenses, excluding fleet transition and restructuring charges and with fuel stated on an economic basis. Fluctuations in
our fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue
reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business.

We currently forecast our mainline costs per ASM excluding fuel for the first quarter and the full year of 2009 to be up 11% to 12% and up 7% to 8%, respectively,
compared to 2008. The increase in unit costs on a full-year basis is primarily due to the following:

•

Expected capacity reductions of 8% for 2009;

•

A $45 million increase in defined-benefit pension costs from $48 million in 2008 to an estimated $93 million in 2009;



•

An increase of $10 million in maintenance expense due to the timing of planned maintenance events and the start of a power-by-the-hour agreement on our B737-700 and B737-900
aircraft, which is expected to provide cost savings over the life of the agreement, but will result in higher expense in 2009;

•

Approximately $10 million in additional aircraft rent that would have been reported as interest expense because of our decision to complete sale-leaseback transactions on six
B737-800 aircraft; and

•

An approximate $15 million increase in our expected incentive payouts in 2009 compared to 2008. Our current expectation is that our results will be better in 2009 compared to
those in 2008. However, actual results can differ significantly as the revenue environment is uncertain and fuel is volatile.

Purchased Capacity Costs

Purchased capacity costs increased $10.9 million to $313.7 million during 2008 compared to $302.8 million in 2007. Of the total, $293.7 million was paid to Horizon under the
capacity purchase arrangement (CPA) for 1.4 billion ASMs. This expense is eliminated in consolidation.

HORIZON AIR

Horizon reported a
loss before income taxes of $55.8 million during 2008 compared to $10.7 million in 2007. The $45.1 million decline in profitability is primarily due to higher fuel costs and fleet transition costs, partially offset by lower non-fuel operating costs
and higher operating revenues.

HORIZON REVENUES

In 2008, operating revenues increased $15.5 million, or 2.2%, compared to 2007. Horizon’s
passenger revenues are summarized in the table below:

Line-of-business information is presented in the
table below. In the CPAs, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information for the CPA arrangements are not presented.

NM

= Not meaningful



System-wide, Horizon’s operating unit revenues increased 12.4% compared to 2007. However, the increase was largely due to the shift in capacity out of Frontier
JetExpress flying (which produced relatively low RASM because of the nature of the contract) to higher RASM brand and Alaska CPA flying. As mentioned earlier, the Frontier JetExpress operation ceased in November 2007.

Horizon brand flying includes routes in the Horizon system not covered by the Alaska CPA. Horizon has
the inventory and revenue risk in these markets. Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying increased $37.9 million, or 9.7%, on

a 6.5% increase in brand capacity and a 3.2% increase in unit revenues. The increase
in unit revenues was due to a 4.1% increase in yields in those markets, partially offset by a 0.7-point decline in load factor.

Revenue from the CPA with Alaska totaled $293.7 million during 2008 compared to $283.4 million in 2007. The increase is primarily driven by the 2.7% increase in unit revenues on
relatively flat capacity. Under the CPA, the fee paid by Alaska is based on Horizon’s operating costs plus a specified margin. This revenue is eliminated in consolidation.

HORIZON EXPENSES

Total operating expenses increased $55.7 million, or 7.7%, as compared to 2007. Along with our financial and statistical data on page 35, we are presenting here our line item
expenses on a per-ASM basis (in cents):



Significant period-over-period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows:

Wages and Benefits

Wages and benefits decreased $7.2 million, or 3.6%, primarily as a result of a 5.1% decrease in FTEs.
We expect that wages and benefits will decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 as we continue to reduce capacity, resulting in fewer full-time equivalent employees.

Aircraft Fuel

Aircraft fuel expense increased $97.2 million, or 70.0%, compared to 2007. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table:

NM

= Not meaningful

The 3.2% increase in consumption was driven by the elimination of Frontier JetExpress flying in 2007. As those aircraft were redeployed into the Horizon fleet, Horizon began purchasing the fuel, whereas under the JetExpress arrangement,
fuel was purchased by Frontier. Offsetting these increases in fuel consumption is the decline in system capacity, which has led to lower fuel consumption needs. Additionally, we have had improved fuel efficiency of our fleet resulting from new Q400
aircraft deliveries as they replaced outgoing Q200 aircraft.

The raw fuel price per
gallon increased by 39.4% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher average crude oil costs and refinery margins.

As at Alaska, we recorded significant mark-to-market losses in 2008 reflecting a steep decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio as fuel prices declined sharply throughout
the year. During 2007, we recorded mark-to-market gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007.

Our

economic fuel expense

is calculated as follows:

NM

= Not meaningful

The total net cash benefit from hedges that settled during 2008, excluding hedges that were terminated early, increased by $12.4 million to $20.9 million compared to 2007. This increase was primarily due to the record high crude oil prices
during the year.

Like Alaska, as part of the effort to restructure our fuel-hedge
portfolio, we terminated a number of contracts originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010 and replaced them with new positions with lower average strike prices. As a result, we realized losses of approximately $8.5 million representing the
difference between the original premiums paid for those contracts when purchased and the amount of cash received from the counterparty on termination of the contracts. We do not anticipate further restructuring of the portfolio at this time. Based
on current jet fuel prices, we expect our

economic fuel expense

to be lower in 2009 than in 2008 because of lower crude oil prices.



Aircraft Maintenance

Aircraft maintenance expense decreased $33.8 million, or 36.7%, primarily as a result of fewer maintenance events and cost savings from process improvements. We currently expect
that maintenance expense will increase in 2009 as we are planning for more scheduled events compared to 2008.

Aircraft Rent

Aircraft rent
decreased $8.7 million, or 13.3%, from 2007 due to the lease termination of a number of Q200 aircraft along with the sublease of additional Q200 aircraft and two CRJ-700 aircraft to third parties. We expect that aircraft rent will decline in 2009 as
a result of the further transition out of leased CRJ-700 aircraft.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and
amortization increased $3.6 million, or 10.6%, as a result of the two new Q400s that were delivered in 2008 and the full-year depreciation on 13 Q400s delivered in 2007. We own all of these new aircraft. We anticipate that depreciation and
amortization expense will continue to increase in 2009 as we take delivery of five more Q400s in the first quarter of 2009.

Fleet Transition Costs

Fleet transition costs associated with the sublease of Q200 aircraft were $8.7 million during 2008 compared to $14.1 million in 2007. All 16 of the Q200 aircraft under the existing
sublease arrangement have been delivered. Although we continue to be obligated under the head leases on subleased aircraft, the discounted future lease payments are recorded as fleet transition costs at the time of the removal of the aircraft from
operations. We also recorded a $1.5 million charge associated with six additional Q200s that were removed from operating service in 2008 and returned to the lessor.

During 2008, as a result of the Board’s decision to retire the CRJ-700 fleet earlier than expected, we recorded a $5.5 million impairment charge

associated with two owned CRJ-700 aircraft and related spare parts, $6.7 million associated with a net loss on the sublease arrangement for two leased CRJ-700 aircraft and $1.3 million for severance charges related
to a reduction in work force. We expect to have further charges related to the exit of the CRJ-700 fleet in 2009, although we are unable to estimate the timing and amount of those charges at this time.

Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM)

Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below:

NM

= Not meaningful

We currently forecast our costs per ASM excluding fuel and the CRJ fleet transition costs to be up about 3% to 4% and 6% to 7% for the first quarter and full year 2009, respectively, compared to 2008. The expected full-year increase in unit
costs is primarily attributable to the expected 8% to 10% capacity reduction and an increase in maintenance costs, offset by declines in Q200 fleet transition costs other non-fuel operating costs.

CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE)

Net nonoperating expense was $41.0 million in 2008 compared to $10.4 million in 2007. Interest income
declined by $11.5 million compared to 2007, primarily as a result of lower average portfolio returns, partially offset by a higher average cash and marketable securities balance. Interest expense increased $14.3 million because of new debt
arrangements in 2007 and 2008, partially offset by lower interest rates on our variable-rate debt. Capitalized interest declined $4.6 million from 2007,



resulting from a decrease in pre-delivery deposits in connection with our orders for B737-800 and Bombardier Q400 aircraft.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)

Our consolidated effective income tax rate on income (loss) before income taxes for 2008 was 36.3%
compared to an effective income tax rate of 38.0% in 2007. The effective rate for 2007 was positively impacted by $2.1 million in credits resulting from a favorable outcome of the state income tax matters referred to in Note 11. Excluding this
benefit, our effective tax rate would have been 39.0%. The difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate of approximately 37.5% is primarily the magnitude of nondeductible expenses, such as employee per-diem
costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

Our
consolidated net income for 2007 was $124.3 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $54.5 million, or $1.44 per share, in 2006.

Both the 2007 and 2006 results include adjustments to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market accounting on fuel hedge portfolio and other
certain significant items noted below that affect the comparability of the years:

•

Our 2006 consolidated net loss includes charges of $189.5 million ($118.5 million after tax) associated with our fleet transition plan (See Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements);

•

We recorded restructuring charges of $24.8 million ($15.5 million after tax) in 2006 associated with the severance packages offered to eligible employees affected by new
contracts;

We believe disclosure of the impact of these individual
charges is useful information to investors because of the reasons provided above in the “2008 Compared With 2007” section.

ALASKA AIRLINES

Alaska reported income before income taxes of $215.0 million during 2007 compared to a loss before income taxes of $94.7 million in 2006. The $309.7 million difference between the
years is primarily due to the fleet transition and restructuring charges recognized in 2006 totaling $218.4 million.

ALASKA REVENUES

Total operating revenues increased $377.4 million, or 14.0%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. The Capacity Purchase Agreement with Horizon, which was new in 2007, made up $265.0 million of the increase, with mainline revenues
contributing $112.4 million of the increase.

Operating
Revenue—Mainline

Mainline passenger revenue increased 3.8% on a 4.0%
increase in available seat miles offset by a modest decline in mainline passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM). The slight decline in PRASM was the result of a 0.3% increase in yields, offset by a 0.4-point decline in load factor compared
to the prior period.

Freight and mail revenue was flat compared to 2006. This is
primarily due to a decline in freight and mail volumes resulting from lower capacity that stemmed from the delay in the conversion of four of our B737-400 passenger aircraft to combi aircraft, offset by an increase in cargo yields, including those
coming through fuel surcharges.

Other—net revenues increased $17.5 million, or
13.5%, primarily as a result of higher commission revenue associated with the sale of mileage credits to our bank partner.

Passenger Revenue—Purchased Capacity

Passenger revenue —purchased capacity increased by $265.0 million to $281.4 million because of the CPA with Horizon. In 2006, Horizon recorded $221.5 million in revenues for
markets covered by the prior revenue-sharing arrangement. Yields in those markets declined 3.3% and load factor increased 1.5 points on a 29.7% increase in capacity.



ALASKA EXPENSES

For the year, total operating expenses increased $64.9 million compared to 2006 as a result of new purchased capacity costs recorded under the CPA with Horizon, offset by a decline
in mainline operating costs.

Mainline Operating Expenses

Total mainline operating costs for 2007 declined by $223.6 million or 8.0% compared to
2006. The absence of the fleet transition costs and restructuring charges in 2007, and lower aircraft fuel expense resulting from mark-to-market gains associated with the value of our fuel hedge portfolio were the primary causes of the decline.

Wages and Benefits

Wages and benefits were relatively flat in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily as a result of the
following:

•

a 3.8% increase in full-time equivalents. The number of full-time equivalent employees increased largely as a result of our initiatives in 2007 to improve our on-time
performance and other operational goals;

•

an increase in the number of flight attendants as we transitioned to B737-800s, which have four flight attendants, compared to three in the MD-80 aircraft that were replaced;
and

•

normal step, scale and market-based wage increases.

These increases were offset by the following:

•

2006 included a $2.7 million contract-signing bonus paid to our flight attendants and a $1.9 million contract-signing bonus paid to our clerical, office and passenger service
employees and our ramp service and stores agents; and

•

a reduction of $15.6 million in expenses associated with our defined-benefit plans as more of our employees transition over to an enhanced defined-contribution plan, offset
by a $1.2 million increase in defined-contribution plan expense.

Variable Incentive Pay

Variable incentive pay for 2007
decreased $14.2 million or 51.3%, compared to 2006. The decrease results from lower annual expense under the various Air Group profit-based incentive plans as our profitability was lower than originally expected, offset by higher expenses associated
with our Operational Performance Rewards plan.

Aircraft Fuel

Aircraft fuel decreased $19.5 million, or 2.6%, in 2007 compared to 2006. The
elements of the change are illustrated in the following table:

NM

= Not meaningful

Fuel gallons consumed were flat on a 4.0% increase in capacity because of the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we transitioned out of the less-efficient MD-80 aircraft to newer, more-efficient B737-800 aircraft.

The raw fuel price per gallon increased by 7.9% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven
by higher crude oil costs.

During 2007, we recorded mark-to-market gains reflecting an
increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. In 2006, we recorded a mark-to-market loss, as oil prices on December 31, 2006 were lower than they were a year earlier.



Our

economic fuel expense

is calculated as follows:

NM

= Not meaningful

Aircraft Maintenance

Aircraft maintenance declined by
$7.0 million, or 4.5%, compared to the prior year largely as a result of the benefits of our fleet transition as we replaced our aging MD-80s and B737-200C aircraft with newer B737-800 and converted B737-400 aircraft, respectively.

Aircraft Rent

Aircraft rent increased by $1.9 million, or 1.7%, because of the sale and short-term leaseback of
substantially all of our owned MD-80 aircraft during the second quarter of 2007 and the addition of two new leased B737-800 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2006, partially offset by the buyout of five leased MD-80 aircraft in the third quarter of
2006.

Landing Fees and Other Rentals

Landing fees and other rentals increased by $11.9 million, or 7.5%, compared to 2006 as a result of
higher costs at Seattle-Tacoma International and other airports.

Selling Expenses

Selling expenses declined by $12.2
million, or 8.6%, compared to 2006 as a result of lower ticket distribution costs and credit card fees that resulted from new contracts that were put into place in the fourth quarter of 2006. The 2006 amount also included $3.7 million paid to

Horizon under the revenue-sharing arrangement in certain designated markets that existed in 2006, compared to zero in 2007 because of the new CPA. These declines were partially offset by higher advertising costs.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased $4.5 million, or 3.3%, compared to 2006. This is primarily the
result of 10 new B737-800 aircraft delivered in 2006 and 14 in 2007, partially offset by the sale and leaseback of 20 MD-80s in 2007.

Other Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses increased because of higher passenger remuneration costs, crew costs, professional fees, software license and maintenance costs, higher property taxes, and
other costs, offset by lower liability insurance expense because of better rates negotiated in December 2006.

Mainline Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM)

Operating costs per ASM (CASM) is an important metric in the industry, and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost-reduction efforts. Our effort to reduce unit costs focuses not only on controlling the actual dollars
we spend, but also on increasing our capacity without adding a commensurate amount of cost.

Our mainline operating costs per mainline ASM are summarized below:

NM

= Not meaningful



HORIZON AIR

Horizon reported a loss before income taxes of $10.7 million during 2007 compared to income before income taxes of $11.3 million in 2006. The $22.0
million decrease is primarily due to higher operating costs, including higher fuel costs and fleet transition costs of $14.1 million, partially offset by higher operating revenues.

HORIZON AIR REVENUES

In 2007, operating revenues increased $74.4 million, or 11.6%, compared to 2006.

Horizon’s passenger revenues are summarized in the table below:

Horizon’s system-wide operating revenues
per ASM increased by 1.9% from 2006. The increase was largely due to the shift in capacity out of Frontier JetExpress flying (which produced relatively low RASM because of the terms of the contract and the longer-haul nature of the flying) to higher
RASM brand and Alaska CPA flying.

Line-of-business information is presented in the table
below. In both CPA arrangements, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information for the CPA arrangements are not presented.

NM

= Not meaningful



Horizon brand flying includes routes in the Horizon system not covered by the Alaska CPA. Horizon has the inventory and revenue
risk in these markets. Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying increased $32.2 million, or 9.0%, on a 19.6% increase in brand capacity offset by an 8.8% decline in unit revenues. The decline in unit revenues was due to a 2.4-point reduction in
load factor, along with a 5.9% decline in yields, resulting from increased competition in many of these brand markets and from intentional pricing actions taken in certain markets to fill the additional capacity.

Revenue from the CPA with Alaska totaled $283.4 million during 2007. Under the CPA, the fee paid by
Alaska is based on Horizon’s actual operating costs plus a specified margin. Under the prior revenue-sharing arrangement, Alaska made a payment to Horizon equal to Horizon’s loss in those markets, if any, and a quarterly bonus that was
based on Alaska’s overall operating margin. Alternatively, Horizon made a payment to Alaska if those markets were profitable.

Revenue from the Frontier JetExpress flying declined 34.3% from $52.5 million in 2006 to $34.5 million in 2007 on a 38.1% decline in ASMs. The ASM decline is consistent with the
wind-down of the JetExpress arrangement that occurred throughout 2007.

HORIZON
EXPENSES

Total operating expenses increased $86.8 million, or 13.7%, as
compared to 2006.

Explanations of significant year-over-year changes in the components
of operating expenses in dollar terms are as follows:

Wages and
Benefits

Wages and benefits increased $11.6 million, or 6.1%, as a result of a
slight increase in full-time equivalent employees, higher wages due to market and step increases, and an increase in our group medical costs.

Aircraft Fuel

Aircraft fuel expense increased $22.3 million, or 19.1%, compared to 2006. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table:

NM

= Not meaningful

The 19.3% increase in consumption was driven by the return of all nine CRJ-700s from Frontier JetExpress and the introduction of several new Q400s into the fleet, replacing smaller Q200s. Under the Frontier JetExpress arrangement, fuel was
purchased by Frontier.

The raw fuel price per gallon increased by 10% as a result of
higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs.

During 2007, we
recorded mark-to-market gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. In 2006, we recorded a mark-to-market loss, as oil prices on December 31, 2006 were lower
than they were a year earlier.



We realized gains of $8.5 million from settled hedge contracts in 2007, compared to $14.1 million in 2006. Our

economic fuel
expense

is calculated as follows:

NM

= Not meaningful

Like Alaska, our fuel hedge protection declined substantially in 2007 as the strike price of our hedges was closer to current oil prices compared to those in place during the previous two years. The total cash benefit from hedges that
settled during the period declined to $8.5 million in 2007 from $14.1 million in 2006.

Aircraft Maintenance

Aircraft maintenance expense
increased $18.1 million, or 24.5%, primarily as a result of a higher number of engine events, including scheduled events on our CRJ-700 engines.

Aircraft Rent

Aircraft rent declined by $3.7 million, or 5.3%, primarily as a result of the reduction in the number of leased Q200 aircraft in our operating fleet. These leased aircraft were
replaced with new, owned Q400s during the year.

Depreciation and
Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased $15.4 million, or 83.2%,
as a result of the 13 new Q400s that were delivered in 2007. We own all of these new aircraft.

Fleet Transition Costs

Fleet transition costs
associated with the sublease of Q200 aircraft were $14.1 million in 2007 as a result of 11 Q200 aircraft that were delivered to a third party.

Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM)

As discussed above, operating costs per ASM (CASM) is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost-reduction efforts.

Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below:

CONSOLIDATED
NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE)

Net nonoperating expense was $10.4 million in 2007
compared to $0.5 million in 2006. Interest income declined by $0.4 million compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a lower average cash and marketable securities balance, partially offset by higher average portfolio returns. Interest expense
increased $10.0 million because of new debt arrangements in 2006 and 2007 and increases in the average interest rate on our variable-rate debt. This increase was offset by the conversion to equity of our $150 million senior convertible notes in
April 2006, which eliminated further interest expense on those notes. Other-net increased $2.6 million, and includes a $3.75 million expense in 2007 associated with our investment in Row 44 given their early stage nature. Capitalized interest
increased $3.1 million from 2006, resulting from an increase in pre-delivery deposits in connection with our orders for B737-800 and Bombardier Q400 aircraft.



CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)

Our consolidated effective income tax rate on income (loss) before income taxes for 2007 was 38.0% compared to an effective income tax rate of 40.0% in 2006. The effective rate for
2007 was positively impacted by $2.1 million in credits resulting from a favorable outcome of the state income tax matters referred to in Note 11. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been 39.0%, which is different from our
marginal 2007 tax rate of 37.4%. The difference is primarily due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses, such as employee per-diem costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards. The 2006 year includes $5.5 million
of tax benefits associated with the reduction of certain tax contingency accruals for periods for which the statute of limitations expired in 2006. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax benefit rate for 2006 would have been 33.8%.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A is
based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties, and that potentially may result in materially different results
under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee.

MILEAGE PLAN

Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on Alaska or Horizon and our many travel partners. Additionally, we sell
miles to third parties, such as our bank partner, for cash. In either case, the outstanding

miles may be redeemed for travel on Alaska, Horizon or any of our alliance partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in
existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For awards earned by passengers who fly on Alaska, Horizon or our travel partners, we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation. For miles
sold to third parties, the majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided. The commission component of these sales proceeds (defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale
of mileage credits minus the amount we defer) is recorded as other-net revenue when the cash is received. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on Alaska or Horizon, and as other-net revenue for
awards issued and flown on partner airlines.

At December 31, 2008, we had
approximately 113 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $690.4 million. Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant
management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in estimates; therefore, an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant
assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below.

1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles:

We defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel. As fare levels change, our deferral rate changes, which may result in the
recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given quarter. For example, due to the year-over-year increases in average ticket prices, our deferral rate increased in 2008,
resulting in lower commission revenue and an increase in the amount of revenue deferred for miles sold. Holding all other



assumptions constant, an additional 1% increase in the deferral rate would have reduced our 2008 commission revenue by approximately $2.6 million.

2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage):

Members may not reach the mileage threshold
necessary for a free ticket, and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel. Therefore, based on the number of Mileage Plan accounts and the miles in the accounts, we estimate how many miles will never be used (“breakage”),
and do not record a liability for those miles. Our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members’ accounts, account balances, and other factors. We believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable in light of historical experience and
future expectations. A hypothetical 1.0% change in our estimate of breakage (currently 12% in the aggregate) has approximately a $7.3 million effect on the liability. Actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates.

3. The number of miles used per award (i.e., free ticket):

We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our
members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. If actual miles used are more or less than estimated, we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding
expense. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical redemptions on Alaska, Horizon or other airlines.

4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on Alaska or Horizon versus other airlines:

The cost for Alaska or Horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other
airlines. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on Alaska or Horizon versus on

other airlines and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards
redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense.

5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel:

When a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on Alaska or Horizon, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to
carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying
the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on
historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may
need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense.

We review
significant Mileage Plan assumptions each quarter and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of
operations.

PENSION PLANS

We account for the defined-benefit pension plans using SFAS No. 158,

Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

(SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s
defined-benefit pension and other postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial



statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income. Under SFAS No. 158, pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over
employees’ approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $48.0 million, $62.6 million, and $78.3 million in 2008, 2007,
and 2006, respectively. We expect the 2009 expense to be significantly higher as a result of the substantial decline in the market value of the plan’s assets in 2008.

The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of
December 31, 2008, we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 7.75%. This rate was developed using historical data, the current value of the underlying assets, as well as long-term inflation
assumptions. We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2008 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S.
equities and U.S. fixed income securities. Decreasing the expected long-term rate of return by 0.5% (from 7.75% to 7.25%) would increase our estimated 2009 pension expense by approximately $3.3 million.

Pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced. We discounted
future pension obligations using a rate of 6.20% and 6.00% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The discount rate at December 31, 2008 was determined using current rates earned on high-quality long-term bonds with maturities that
correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans. Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5% (from 6.20% to 5.70%) would increase our

projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2008 by
approximately $78.9 million and increase estimated 2009 pension expense by approximately $8.8 million.

With the exception of the plan covering Alaska’s pilots, all of our defined-benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and
liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future.

LONG-LIVED
ASSETS

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $3.2 billion of property
and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in fleet plans, the expected residual values of the assets, and
the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets,
management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset.

In 2006, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $131.1 million to write down our MD-80 fleet to its
estimated fair market value, resulting from our decision to exit the fleet earlier than originally planned. Additionally, we bought five MD-80 aircraft from lessors and terminated the leases for those five aircraft. The total purchase price for the
five aircraft was $80.9 million, including assumed debt of $11.6 million. Immediately upon purchase of the aircraft, we evaluated impairment and concluded that the carrying value was not recoverable. As a result, we recorded an additional $58.4
million charge in the third quarter of 2006 for the impairment. See Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the impairment of the MD-80s.



In 2007, Horizon announced plans to phase out its remaining leased Q200 aircraft and is actively remarketing the remaining six leased operating aircraft. All of these
aircraft are leased under operating lease agreements. As a result of this decision, we reassessed the depreciable lives and salvage values of the related rotable and repairable Q200 parts and, as such, we have now depreciated these parts down to
their estimated salvage value. We are in the process of disposing of these parts.

In
2008, Horizon announced plans to exit its CRJ-700 fleet as soon as possible, dependent on the ability to remarket the aircraft. As a result of the decision, we determined that the two owned CRJ-700s were impaired and recorded an impairment charge on
the aircraft and their related spare parts of $5.5 million in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value. We have reassessed the depreciable lives and salvage values of the two owned aircraft and the related
spare parts and are depreciating those assets over their remaining estimated useful lives.

There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than
expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft.

PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Standards (SFAS) No. 141R,

Business Combinations

, and SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.

These standards were issued jointly and will require most identifiable assets, liabilities,
noncontrolling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value and will require noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to

be reported as
a component of equity, which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders. Both statements are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141R will be applied only to
acquisitions subsequent to the effective date and SFAS No. 160 will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests, including any that arose before the effective date. We do not expect these statements to have a significant impact on
our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

. SFAS 161 requires entities that use derivative instruments to provide certain qualitative
disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments, amounts and location of the derivatives in the financial statements, among other disclosures. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. Because of the importance and prominence of the Company’s fuel-hedging program, management believes that the current disclosures included in quarterly and annual filings
include many of the disclosures required under SFAS 161. Therefore, we currently do not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 161 will have a material impact on the disclosures already provided.

In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 132(R)-1 amending SFAS 132(R),

Employers’
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

, which, among other things, expands the disclosures regarding assets in an employer’s pension and postretirement benefit plans. The primary change would be to add the fair value
hierarchy disclosures required by SFAS No. 157 as it relates to the underlying assets of the pension and postretirement benefit plans. The disclosures required by this position are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009.
This position will only impact our financial statement disclosures and will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Because of the current tumultuous economic environment and uncertain demand conditions, we continue to have a significant focus on preserving our
liquidity position. In addition to the bank line-of-credit and pre-delivery payment facilities described below, other sources of liquidity may include financing other assets such as the 10 unencumbered aircraft in our fleet, aircraft parts, or
receivables or a “forward sale” of mileage credits to our bank partner. We plan to sell up to four B737-700 aircraft in 2009 and we have agreements to complete sale-leaseback financing for six B737-800 by the end of February 2009. The
sale-leaseback transactions are expected to result in gross proceeds of $231 million. The current economic environment is hindering the remarketing effort for the B737-700 aircraft and there is no assurance that we will be able to sell these
aircraft at an acceptable price.

We believe that our current cash and marketable securities of $1.1 billion combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will fund our
operations for the foreseeable future. In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in U.S. government securities, asset-backed obligations and corporate debt securities. We do not invest in equities or auction-rate securities. As
of December 31, 2008, our net unrealized loss on our $1.1 billion cash and marketable securities balance was $4.0 million.

Our overall investment strategy for our marketable securities portfolio has a primary goal of maintaining and securing its investment principal. Our investment portfolio is managed
by reputable financial institutions and continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy.

The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity.

During the year ended December 31, 2008,
our cash and marketable securities increased $254.6 million to $1.1 billion. The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase and our expectation of future cash requirements.

ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

During 2008, net cash provided by operating activities was $164.3 million, compared to $482.0 million
during 2007. The decline of $317.7 million was primarily driven by a $277.6 million increase in economic fuel costs, which approximates the actual cash paid for fuel during the period. Furthermore, we had a $44 million

difference in the timing of cash payments received from customers for future travel and we had cash outlays of approximately $156 million of premium cost for new fuel-hedge contracts in 2008 compared to only $17 million in 2007. These
declines in operating cash flow were partially offset by the $156.6 million increase in operating revenues in 2008. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, but anticipate consuming substantially all of that cash plus additional
debt proceeds for capital expenditures and debt payments in 2009.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Our investing
activities are primarily made up of capital expenditures associated with our fleet transitions and, to a lesser extent, purchases



and sales of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was $581.3 million during 2008, compared to $601.8 million in 2007. Our capital expenditures
declined by $421.6 million as a result of the purchase of 11 B737-800s and two Q400s in 2008, versus the purchase of 14 B737-800s and 13 Q400s in 2007. This amount was partially offset by the return of $80 million of pre-delivery payments from
Boeing resulting from the delay in aircraft deliveries.

We currently expect capital
expenditures to be approximately $455 million (of which $405 million is expected to be aircraft-related) during 2009 as we take delivery of ten new B737-800s and five new Q400s. Capital expenditures are expected to decrease significantly in 2010 as
we near the end of our committed firm aircraft deliveries. We do have a number of options for both B737-800 and Q400 aircraft available should we decide to convert those into firm commitments. However, a decision to exercise those options is highly
dependent on our ability to deploy those new aircraft profitably and generate returns that exceed our cost of capital.

Cash Provided by Financing Activities

We finance a large portion of our capital spending with debt financing. Net cash provided by financing activities was $495.8 million during 2008 compared to $93.4 million during
2007. We obtained debt financing for 12 B737-800 aircraft and 15 Q400 aircraft during 2008 as we endeavored to increase our cash and marketable securities portfolio to help sustain us through the period of significantly high fuel prices and to
prepare us for the current economic environment. We also borrowed $194.9 million on our pre-delivery payment facility during the year and drew down $75 million on our bank line of credit facility. Offsetting the borrowings were $343.2 million of
debt payments and the repurchase of $48.9 million of our common stock as part of our common stock repurchase program.

We plan to meet our significant capital and operating commitments through internally

generated funds from operations and cash and marketable
securities on hand, along with additional debt financing and proceeds from our pre-delivery payment facility. We have financing already in place for deliveries of our Q400s through 2010 and we are actively pursuing financing alternatives for the
B737-800 deliveries, including sale-leaseback transactions or traditional debt financing. Given the current distress in the financial markets, we may not be able to obtain financing with terms that are acceptable.

Bank Line-of-Credit Facility

Alaska has a $185 million variable-rate credit facility that expires in March 2010. As of
December 31, 2008, $75 million is outstanding on this credit facility, which is classified as current long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. On September 24, 2008, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the credit facility that
eliminated all previous financial covenants and replaced them with a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance of $500 million. See Note 6 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Pre-delivery Payment Facility

Alaska’s $172 million variable-rate revolving loan facility is available to provide a portion of
the pre-delivery funding requirements of Alaska’s purchase of Boeing 737-800 aircraft under the current aircraft purchase agreement. The maximum available amount is reduced to $152 million beginning in August 2009. The facility expires on
August 31, 2011. The interest rate is based on one-month LIBOR plus a specified margin. Borrowings are secured by Alaska’s rights under the Boeing purchase agreement. The principal amounts outstanding on the facility relate to specified
aircraft and will be repaid when Alaska takes delivery of the aircraft, if not sooner. As of December 31, 2008, $39.9 million was outstanding under this facility, all of which is classified as current portion of long-term debt in our
consolidated balance sheets.



CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Aircraft Purchase Commitments

At December 31, 2008, we had firm orders to purchase 33 aircraft requiring future aggregate
payments of approximately $753.4 million, as set forth below. Alaska has options to acquire 45 additional B737s and Horizon has options to acquire ten Q400s. In addition to aircraft purchased during 2008 as previously discussed, Alaska took delivery
of one B737-800 aircraft under an operating lease arrangement.

The following table
summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year, as of December 31, 2008:

*

Includes pre-delivery payments to Boeing and Bombardier as well as final aircraft payments.

Three of the B737-800 aircraft and two of the Q400 aircraft were delivered subsequent to December 31, 2008, but before the filing of this Form
10-K. These aircraft were paid for with cash on hand, but are expected to be financed with long-term debt or sale-leaseback arrangements. The remaining aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2009 are expected to be delivered in the first six months of
the year.

Because of our capacity reduction plans and the uncertainty around the
ultimate disposal of Horizon’s CRJ-700 fleet, we have deferred Q400 deliveries from 2009 into 2010 and 2011. Due to the Boeing mechanics strike in 2008, five of our expected 2008 B737-800 deliveries were delayed to 2009 and one of our 2009
deliveries was delayed to 2010. Our working relationships with Boeing and Bombardier have historically allowed us to renegotiate aircraft delivery schedules under certain circumstances, specifically the recent deferral of Q400 deliveries at Horizon.
We believe our relationship with these suppliers will continue to allow us some flexibility with aircraft deliveries in the future should we need to adjust our capacity plans.

Contractual Obligations

The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other
obligations as of December 31, 2008.

(1)

Operating lease commitments generally include aircraft operating leases, airport property and hangar leases, office space, and other equipment leases. The aircraft operating leases include
lease obligations for four leased MD-80 aircraft, all of which we retired earlier than expected in connection with our fleet transition plan. We have accrued for these leases based on their discounted future cash flows and we remain obligated under
the existing lease contracts on these aircraft.

(2)

For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2008.

(3)

Includes minimum obligations under our long-term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreements for all B737 engines other than the B737-800.

(4)

Excludes $23.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements.



Pension Obligations

The table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans, which could be approximately $45 million to $75 million per year based on our historical funding practice,
although there is no minimum required contribution in 2009. In addition, recent market performance resulted in a decline in the fair value of plan assets and an increase in the unfunded liability for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans to
$444.9 million at December 31, 2008. This results in a 59.4% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 86.2% funded as of December 31, 2007.

Credit Card Agreements

We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that,
if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such

agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is
downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed.

EFFECT OF INFLATION AND PRICE CHANGES

Inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our
operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income.

OTHER

We strive to provide a return to our
investors that exceeds the cost of the capital employed in our business. Our targeted return on invested capital (ROIC) is 10%. We have not historically reached this threshold, nor did we in 2008 or 2007. However, our strategic plan is built on the
premise of providing an appropriate return to all capital providers.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE

ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have
interest-rate risk on our variable-rate debt obligations and our available-for-sale marketable investment portfolio, and commodity-price risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet. We purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing
market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means. We have market-sensitive instruments in the form of fixed-rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure
to jet-fuel price increases. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Market Risk – Aircraft Fuel

Currently, our fuel-hedging portfolio consists almost exclusively of crude oil call options. We utilize the contracts in our portfolio as hedges to

decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Call options are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of fuel prices, allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing fuel prices. With these call option
contracts, we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices, as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums that we pay to enter into the contracts. Although to a lesser extent, we also use collar structures for fuel hedging purposes.
We believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases. We estimate that a 10% increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of December 31, 2008 would increase or decrease the fair value of our hedge portfolio by
approximately $13.9 million and $12.4 million, respectively.

Additionally, we have
entered into fuel purchase contracts that fix the refining margin we pay for



approximately 40% of our fuel consumption in the first quarter of 2009.

Our portfolio of fuel hedge contracts was worth $28.3 million at December 31, 2008, for which we have paid $89.1 of premiums to counterparties, compared to a portfolio value
of $112.5 million at December 31, 2007. The total value of $28.3 million at December 31, 2008 is net of a $24.1 million liability associated with collar structures that would require future cash outlays if oil prices remained below the
strike price. We do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of December 31, 2008.

We continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices. We expect to continue to enter into these
types of contracts prospectively, although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions. For more discussion, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

Financial Market Risk

We have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and short-term investment

portfolio. Our debt obligations include variable-rate instruments, which have exposure to changes in interest rates. This exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variable-rate investment portfolio. A hypothetical 10% change
in the average interest rates incurred on variable-rate debt during 2008 would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately $1.8 million. In order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate
fluctuations, we have fixed the interest rates on certain existing variable-rate debt agreements over the past several years. Additionally, several of our new debt arrangements entered into during 2006 through 2007 are fixed-rate arrangements. Due
to the current low interest rate environment, all of our 2008 debt arrangements have been fixed-rate arrangements. Our variable-rate debt is approximately 20% of our total long-term debt at December 31, 2008 compared to 40% at December 31,
2007.

We also have investments in marketable securities, which are exposed to market
risk associated with changes in interest rates. If short-term interest rates were to average 1% more than they did in 2008, interest income would increase by approximately $9.1 million.



ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

SELECTED QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (unaudited)

*

For earnings per share, the sum of the quarters will not equal the total for the full year.

**

First quarter results for 2008 and 2007 have been adjusted for an error in our calculation of stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R for certain awards granted after January 1,
2006. The error resulted in an understatement of wages and benefits of $2.3 million and $1.1 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We have concluded that this item is not material, and in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
we will make appropriate adjustments to our previously filed financial statements when they are presented in our first quarter 2009 Form 10Q. See Note 16 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Alaska Air Group, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alaska Air Group, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. In connection
with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all

material respects, the financial position of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth thereon.

As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

December 31, 2008

NOTE 1. GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Basis of
Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group or the Company) and its subsidiaries, Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon), through which the Company conducts substantially all of its operations. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated. These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and their preparation requires the use of management’s
estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Nature
of Operations

Alaska and Horizon operate as airlines. However, their business
plans, competition, and economic risks differ substantially. Alaska is a major airline and principally serves destinations in the state of Alaska and provides north/south service between cities in the western U.S., Canada and Mexico. Alaska also
provides east/west service to a number of cities in the contiguous U.S. and four islands in Hawaii, primarily from Seattle and to a lesser extent, from Portland and Anchorage. It operates an all-jet fleet and its average passenger trip in 2008 was
1,113 miles. Horizon is a regional airline serving primarily the Pacific Northwest, northern California, and western Canada. Horizon serves its own native markets and provides certain contract flying for Alaska. Horizon operates both jet and
turboprop aircraft, and its average passenger trip in 2008 was 357 miles.

West Coast
passenger traffic accounted for 41% of Alaska’s 2008 revenue passenger miles, passenger traffic within Alaska and between Alaska and the U.S. mainland accounted for 23%, transcontinental flights accounted for 20%, the Mexico markets accounted
for 8%, the Hawaii markets accounted for 5%, and the Canada markets accounted for 3%. Based on

passenger enplanements, Alaska’s leading airports are Seattle, Los Angeles, Anchorage, and Portland. Based on 2008
revenues, its leading nonstop routes are Anchorage-Seattle, Los Angeles-Seattle, and San Diego-Seattle.

Approximately 91% of Horizon’s network revenue passenger miles were flown domestically, primarily in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. The Canada markets accounted for 8% of revenue passenger miles
in 2008. Flying to Mexico in 2008 accounted for less than 1% of total revenue passenger miles. Based on passenger enplanements, Horizon’s leading airports are Seattle, Portland, Boise, and Spokane. Based on revenues in 2008, its leading nonstop
routes are Portland-Seattle, Spokane-Seattle, and Boise-Seattle.

The Company’s
operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties, such as general economic conditions, volatile fuel prices, industry instability, intense competition, a largely unionized work force, the need to finance large capital
expenditures and the related availability of capital, government regulation, and potential aircraft incidents.

Approximately 84% and 49% of Alaska and Horizon employees, respectively, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 22% and 47% of Alaska and Horizon employees, respectively, are covered under agreements
that are currently in negotiations or become amendable prior to December 31, 2009.

The airline industry is characterized by high fixed costs. Small fluctuations in load factors and yield (a measure of ticket prices) can have a significant impact on operating results. The Company has been and continues working to reduce
unit costs to better compete with carriers that have lower cost structures.

Substantially all of Alaska’s and Horizon’s sales occur in the United States. See Note 13 for



operating segment information and geographic concentrations.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior year’s data to the current format.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. They are carried at cost, which approximates market. The Company reduces
cash balances when checks are disbursed. Due to the time delay in checks clearing the banks, the Company normally maintains a negative balance in its cash disbursement accounts, which is reported as a current liability. The amount of the negative
cash balance was $14.1 million and $22.3 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is included in accounts payable.

Securities Lending

The Company ended its securities lending program during the fourth quarter of 2008 and had no securities on loan under the program at December 31, 2008. Prior to the fourth
quarter of 2008, from time to time, the Company lent certain marketable securities to third parties for a period of less than one year to enhance investment income. During the time period in which these securities were loaned to the third parties,
the Company required cash collateral for 102% of the daily market value of the loaned securities. This cash collateral was restricted and was deposited with a lending agent and invested by that agent in accordance with the Company’s guidelines.
The Company maintained full ownership rights to the securities loaned and

continued to earn interest and appreciation on them. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $109.8 million of securities on loan
under the program. These affected securities were included as marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Receivables

Receivables consist primarily of airline traffic (including credit card) receivables, amounts from customers, Mileage Plan partners, government tax authorities, and other
miscellaneous amounts due to the Company, and are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on known troubled accounts and historical experience applied to an aging of accounts.

Inventories and Supplies—net

Expendable aircraft parts, materials and supplies are stated at average cost and are included in
inventories and supplies-net. An obsolescence allowance for expendable parts is accrued based on estimated lives of the corresponding fleet type and salvage values. Surplus inventories are carried at their net realizable value. The allowance for all
non-surplus expendable inventories was $21.4 million and $24.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decline in the allowance is primarily attributable to the write off of the MD-80 and B737-200 parts allowances against the
cost basis during the period. Inventory and supplies-net also includes fuel inventory of $15.9 million and $6.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Repairable and rotable aircraft parts inventory are included in flight
equipment.



Property, Equipment and Depreciation

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which are as follows:

As a result of the early retirement of the MD-80
and Q200 fleets, all aircraft and related flight equipment have been depreciated to their expected salvage values. The CRJ-700 fleet and related parts are being depreciated over their remaining estimated lives to their expected salvage values. The
estimated useful lives are aligned with the fleet’s average expected retirement date.

“Related flight equipment” includes rotable and repairable spare inventories, which are depreciated over the associated fleet life unless otherwise noted.

Maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Major modifications that extend the life or improve the usefulness of aircraft are capitalized and
depreciated over their estimated period of use.

The Company evaluates long-lived assets
to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the total carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company groups assets for purposes of such reviews at the lowest level for
which identifiable cash flows of the asset group are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of
the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. If the asset or asset group is not considered recoverable, a write- down equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value will be recorded. The
Company

determined that its two owned CRJ-700 aircraft and the fleet’s related spare parts were impaired during 2008. See Note 2 for further discussion of this impairment and other fleet transition costs.

Internally Used Software Costs

The Company capitalizes costs to develop internal-use software that are incurred in the application
development stage. Amortization commences when the software is ready for its intended use and the amortization period is the estimated useful life of the software, generally three to five years. Capitalized costs primarily include contract labor and
payroll costs of the individuals dedicated to the development of internal-use software. The Company capitalized software development costs of $1.0 million, $3.0 million, and $2.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively.

Workers Compensation and Employee Health-Care
Accruals

The Company uses a combination of self-insurance and insurance
programs to provide for workers compensation claims and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience,
severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.



Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue results primarily from the sale of mileage credits. This revenue is recognized when award transportation is provided or over the term
of the applicable agreements.

Operating Leases

The Company leases aircraft, airport and terminal facilities, office space, and other equipment
under operating leases. Some of these lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses or rent holidays. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial
occupancy, the Company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the consolidated statements of operations.

Leased Aircraft Return Costs

Cash payments associated with returning leased aircraft are accrued beginning immediately after the last heavy maintenance visit prior to the scheduled aircraft return date. This
accrual is based on the time remaining on the lease, planned aircraft usage and the provisions included in the lease agreement, although the actual amount due to any lessor upon return will not be known with certainty until lease termination.

As leased aircraft are returned, any payments are charged against the established
accrual. The accrual is part of other current and long-term liabilities, and was $14.2 million and $6.9 million as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. The increase in the accrual is primarily due to the four leased
MD-80 aircraft that were retired in 2008 and sent to a temporary aircraft storage facility. The associated lease return expense related to these four aircraft was approximately $9 million and is included in “Fleet transition costs –
MD-80” in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no other material changes in our estimate of leased aircraft return costs during 2008.

Revenue Recognition

Passenger revenue is recognized when the passenger travels. Tickets sold but not yet used are reported as air traffic liability. Passenger traffic commissions and related fees are
expensed when the related revenue is recognized. Passenger traffic commissions and related fees not yet recognized are included as a prepaid expense. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with
other airlines, certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the Company’s historical data.

Freight and mail revenues are recognized when service is provided. Other-net revenues
are primarily related to the Mileage Plan and they are recognized as described in the “Mileage Plan” paragraph below.

Mileage Plan

Alaska operates a frequent flyer program (“Mileage Plan”) that provides travel awards to members based on accumulated mileage. For miles earned by flying on Alaska and
through airline partners, the estimated cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are earned and accumulated. Alaska also sells mileage credits to non-airline partners such as hotels,
car rental agencies, a grocery store chain, and a major bank that offers Alaska Airlines affinity credit cards. The Company defers the portion of the sales proceeds that represents the estimated fair value of the award transportation and recognizes
that amount as revenue when the award transportation is provided. The deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards redeemed and flown on Alaska or Horizon, and as other-net revenue for awards redeemed and flown on other airlines.
The portion of the sales proceeds not deferred is recognized as commission income and included in other revenue-net in the consolidated statements of operations. Alaska’s Mileage Plan deferred revenue and liabilities are included under the



following consolidated balance sheet captions at December 31 (in millions):

The amounts recorded in other accrued
liabilities relate primarily to deferred revenue expected to be realized within one year, including $43.4 million and $37.1 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, associated with Mileage Plan awards issued but not yet flown.

Alaska’s Mileage Plan revenue is included under the following consolidated statements of
operations captions for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

During 2008, the Company changed the terms of
its Mileage Plan program regarding the expiration of award miles. Beginning in the third quarter, Mileage Plan accounts with no activity for two years are deleted. As a result of the deletion of a number of accounts, the Company reduced its
liability for future travel awards by $42.3 million, which has been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as “Change in Mileage Plan terms.”

Aircraft Fuel

Aircraft fuel includes raw jet fuel and associated “into-plane” costs, fuel taxes, oil, and all of the gains and losses associated with fuel hedge contracts.

Contracted Services

Contracted services includes expenses for ground handling, security, navigation fees, temporary
employees, data processing fees, and other similar services.

Selling Expenses

Selling expenses include credit card
fees, global distribution systems charges, the estimated cost of Mileage Plan free travel awards, advertising, promotional costs, commissions, and incentives. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time the advertising takes place.
Advertising expense was $14.0 million, $13.7 million, and $14.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Capitalized Interest

Interest is capitalized on flight equipment purchase deposits as a cost of the related asset, and is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. The capitalized
interest is based on the Company’s weighted-average borrowing rate.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for
financial derivative instruments utilizing Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133),

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended. See Note 3 for further discussion.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting income taxes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be



recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance would be established, if necessary, for the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. The Company accounts for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48). See Note 11 for further discussion.

Taxes Collected from Passengers

Taxes collected from passengers, including sales taxes, airport and security fees and other fees, are
recorded on a net basis within passenger revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts
for equity awards using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment: An Amendment of SFAS Nos. 123 and 95. This standard requires companies to recognize as expense the fair value of stock options and other
equity-based compensation issued to employees as of the grant date. The standard applies to stock options, restricted stock units, and performance stock units that the Company grants to employees as well as the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (ESPP), which features a look-back provision and allows employees to purchase stock at a 15% discount. The Company used the “modified prospective method” when SFAS 123R was adopted in 2006, which is explained below. All stock-based
compensation expense is recorded in wages and benefits in the consolidated statements of operations.

For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, for which the vesting period is not complete, the “modified prospective method” for transition permitted by SFAS 123R was used. Under this method, the Company
accounts for the unvested portion of these awards on a

prospective basis, with expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning January 1, 2006 using the grant-date fair values
previously calculated for pro-forma disclosures. The Company selected this method due to the relatively limited use of stock-based awards and the immaterial impact on the comparability between periods. The standard also requires that tax benefits
realized from stock award exercise gains in excess of stock-based compensation expense recognized for financial statement purposes be reported as cash inflows from financing activities and cash outflows from operating activities.

Variable Interest Entities

The Company is the lessee in a series of operating leases covering our leased aircraft. In many
instances, the lessors are trusts established by a third party specifically to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to the Company. These leasing entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities. However, they do not meet the consolidation
requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(FIN 46), because the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the entity’s expected gains or
losses. The Company’s conclusions are based on the fact that the leasing arrangements involved contain terms which are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include residual value guarantees made by the Company,
fixed-price purchase obligations or similar features that obligate the Company to absorb the majority of expected losses of the variable interest entities. The Company’s maximum exposure under these types of lease arrangements is the remaining
lease payments, which are reflected in future lease commitments in Note 7 (plus the cost, if any, of bringing the equipment into compliance with the physical condition required for return, which is accrued as leased aircraft return costs).

Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2008

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of



Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,

which allows entities the option to measure
eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates. Such election, which may be applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected. This statement was effective beginning January 1, 2008. The
Company did not elect the fair value option upon adoption.

In September 2006, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair-value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 does
not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. The Company partially adopted this standard for financial assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2008. In accordance with FASB Staff Position
No. 157-2, the Company has deferred adoption of SFAS 157 as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009. In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a
Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active

(FSP 157-3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in cases where a market is not active. The Company has considered the guidance provided by FSP 157-3 in its determination
of estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008, and determined that there was no impact.

SFAS 157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants on the measurement date. SFAS 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard
describes

three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1

- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2

- Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3

- Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

The Company uses the “market approach” in determining the fair value of its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The securities
held by the Company are valued based on observable prices in active markets. Amounts measured at fair value as of December 31, 2008 are as follows:

Fourth quarter 2006 adjustments included a favorable $7.6 million adjustment to restructuring charges to adjust for the number of employees that withdrew their participation in the severance program. See Note 4 for further discussion.



NOTE 2. FLEET TRANSITION AND IMPAIRMENT

Alaska Transition to All-Boeing 737 Fleet

In March 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to accelerate the retirement of its MD-80 fleet (15 owned and 11 leased aircraft at the time) and remove those
aircraft from service by the end of 2008. At December 31, 2008, all of the Company’s MD-80s had been removed from operations.

All but four of the MD-80 aircraft have been sold or returned to the lessor. The four remaining MD-80 aircraft are under long-term lease arrangements. Two of the aircraft were
retired during the second quarter and the remaining two were retired during the third quarter. All four have been placed in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility. As a result, the Company recorded a $47.5 million charge in 2008
reflecting the remaining discounted future lease payments and other contract-related costs. The actual future cash payments are included in the lease commitment table in Note 7.

Horizon Transition to All-Q400 Fleet

Horizon is in the process of transitioning to an all-Q400 fleet. At the beginning of 2008, Horizon had 17 Q200s in the fleet, of which the Company was
able to remarket all but six through sublease agreements or arranged sales of the aircraft to third parties. The total charge during 2008 related to the removal of these aircraft from operation was $10.2 million, which represents the estimated
sublease loss for five aircraft delivered under an existing sublease arrangement with a third party and the loss on the termination of the underlying leases of six

additional aircraft. Although all remaining Q200
aircraft have been removed from scheduled operations as of the end of 2008, there are six remaining aircraft that were used as spare aircraft through the end of January 2009. The Company is actively remarketing these remaining aircraft and expects
to have an associated charge in the first quarter of 2009. Management does not believe the charge will be material to our financial results.

In the first quarter of 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the plan to remove the CRJ-700 fleet from operations, in addition to the Q200 transition described
above. As a result of the decision, the Company determined that its two owned CRJ-700s were impaired and recorded an impairment charge on the aircraft and their related spare parts of $5.5 million in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of these assets
to their estimated fair value. Additionally, during 2008, the Company recorded severance charges of $1.3 million related to this fleet transition. Management is currently evaluating various alternatives to dispose of the two owned and 18 leased
aircraft in the most economically feasible way. Two of the leased aircraft were subleased to a third party during the fourth quarter, resulting in an estimated sublease loss of $6.7 million. The current economic conditions are hindering the
remarketing effort and could result in further delays of the timeline to transition completely to an all-Q400 fleet. As such, the nature, timing or amount of any potential gain or loss associated with transactions on the remaining aircraft cannot be
reasonably estimated at this time.

NOTE 3. FUEL HEDGE CONTRACTS

The Company’s operations are inherently dependent upon the price and availability of aircraft fuel. To manage economic risks associated with fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices, the Company periodically enters into call
options, collar structures, and swap agreements for crude oil, among other initiatives.

The Company records derivative instruments, all of which are currently fuel hedge contracts, on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of these fuel hedge contracts are recorded each period in aircraft fuel
expense.



The following table summarizes the components of aircraft fuel expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in millions):

The Company uses the “market approach”
in determining the fair value of its hedge portfolio. The Company’s fuel hedging contracts consist of over-the-counter contracts, which are not traded on an exchange. The fair value of these contracts is determined based on observable inputs
that are readily available in active markets or can be derived from information available in active, quoted markets. Therefore, the Company has categorized these contracts as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in SFAS 157. The Company
realized gains of $122.7 million, $53.4 million, and $101.1 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, on fuel hedge contracts that settled during the period based on their originally scheduled settlement date. Additionally, the Company
terminated some of its fuel hedge contracts in the fourth quarter of 2008 that had scheduled settlement dates in 2009 and 2010. The Company realized losses of $50 million on these contracts, which represents the difference between the original
premiums paid for those contracts less the cash received upon termination.

Outstanding fuel hedge positions as of December 31, 2008 are as follows:

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair
values of the Company’s fuel hedge positions were $28.3 million and $112.5 million, respectively, including capitalized premiums paid of $89.1 million and $30.9 million, respectively. The $28.3 million value as of December 31, 2008 is net
of a $24.1 million liability associated with the Company’s collar hedge contracts.

NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

In the third quarter of 2008, Alaska announced reductions in work force among union and non-union
employees. The non-union employees that were affected by the reduction were terminated in the third quarter, resulting in a $1.6 million severance charge. For union personnel, the Company offered extended leaves, a voluntary furlough program, and an
early-out package with a lump-sum payment based on years of service that included continuation

of medical coverage and travel privileges for a specified period. In addition to the voluntary offers, there have been
involuntary furloughs to achieve the target reduction in work force. The Company recorded an $11.3 million charge in 2008 representing the severance payments and estimated medical coverage obligation for the affected union employees, bringing the
total severance for 2008 to $12.9 million.



In 2006, Alaska reached new four-year agreements with its clerical, office and passenger service employees and the ramp service and stores agents, all represented by
the International Association of Machinists. Alaska also reached a new four-year agreement with its flight attendants. These agreements included wage increases and signing bonuses of $4.6 million paid in 2006, which are included in wages and
benefits in the consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, the agreements included severance packages offered to certain employees that included cash payments based on years of service, and medical coverage and continued travel privileges
for a period of time. The resulting charge was $24.8 million in 2006.

The following
table displays the activity and balance of the severance and related cost

components of the Company’s restructuring accrual as of and for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in millions):

The Company will make the majority of the
remaining cash payments in the first quarter of 2009. The accrual for severance and related costs is included in accrued wages, vacation and payroll taxes in the consolidated balance sheets.

NOTE 5. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

At December 31, 2008 and 2007
all of the Company’s marketable securities, including securities pledged under the securities lending program, were classified as available-for-sale. The securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in
shareholders’ equity under the caption “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.” Realized gains and losses are included in other nonoperating income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.

The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on
marketable securities are included in interest income in the consolidated statements of operations.

Marketable securities consisted of the following at December 31 (in millions):

The Company’s overall investment strategy
has a primary goal of maintaining and securing its investment principal. The Company’s investment portfolio is managed by well-known financial institutions and continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with the
Company’s documented strategy.



As of December 31, 2008, the Company had net unrealized losses of $4.0 million in its $1.1 billion cash and marketable
securities balance portfolio, which management believes is not an “other-than-temporary” impairment as defined by FASB Staff Position FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments.

However, during 2008, the Company did determine that certain corporate debt securities were other-than-temporarily impaired. As such, the Company recorded a $3.5 million loss in other – net nonoperating expense during the
period representing the difference between the estimated fair market value and the amortized cost of the securities. Gross unrealized gains and losses at December 31, 2008 are presented in the table below. At December 31, 2007, gross
unrealized gains and losses were not material.

There are a small number of securities that
compose the $3.4 million of unrealized losses that have been in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months. These securities have an aggregate fair value at December 31, 2008 of $20.9 million. As noted above, the majority of the
securities that compose the $3.4 million unrealized loss are asset-backed obligations, or mortgage-backed securities. For these specific securities, management has reviewed the portfolio and has determined that these securities are not
other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2008 based on the facts and circumstances. Management currently has the ability and intent to hold these securities to recovery.

Of the marketable securities on hand at December 31, 2008, 31% mature in 2009, 25% in 2010, and 44% thereafter.

NOTE 6. LONG-TERM DEBT

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, long-term debt obligations were as follows (in millions):

*

The weighted-average fixed-interest rate was 6.1% and 6.9% as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The weighted-average variable-interest rate, including the interest rate on the
pre-delivery payment facility, was 4.0% and 6.5% as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



At December 31, 2008, all of the Company’s borrowings were secured by flight equipment and future delivery positions.

Alaska has a $172 million variable-rate revolving pre-delivery payment (PDP) facility with a syndicate
of lenders to provide a portion of the pre-delivery funding requirements for the purchase of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft under the current aircraft purchase agreement. The interest rate is based on the one-month LIBOR plus a specified margin.
Borrowings are secured by the Company’s rights under the Boeing purchase agreement. The principal amounts outstanding on the PDP facility relate to specified aircraft and are repaid at the time the Company takes delivery of the aircraft, if not
before, likely using cash on hand or proceeds from long-term debt financing on the specified aircraft. The facility expires in August 2011 and the maximum available under the facility is reduced to $152 million in August 2009.

During 2008, Alaska borrowed $388.6 million using fixed-rate debt secured by flight equipment, $75
million from its bank line of credit facility and $194.9 million from the PDP facility. Alaska made payments of $331.7 million, including $240.8 million to the PDP facility. Additionally, Horizon financed 15 of its recently delivered Q400 aircraft
using a fixed-rate debt arrangement with proceeds totaling $225.4 million and made scheduled debt payments of $11.5 million.

At December 31, 2008, long-term debt principal payments for the next five years are as follows (in millions):

Bank Line of Credit

The Company has a $185 million credit facility with a syndicate of financial
institutions. The interest rate on the credit facility varies depending on certain financial ratios specified in the agreement with a minimum interest rate of LIBOR plus a specified margin. The agreement provides that any borrowings will be secured
by either aircraft or cash collateral. The facility expires on March 31, 2010. In September 2008, Alaska entered into the Fourth Amendment to the credit facility. The amendment eliminated all previous financial covenants and replaced them with
a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance of $500 million. The Company is in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, $75 million is outstanding under this
credit facility.

NOTE 7. COMMITMENTS

Lease Commitments

At
December 31, 2008, the Company had lease contracts for 96 aircraft, 24 of which are non-operating aircraft that have remaining noncancelable lease terms of less than one year to 12 years. The majority of airport and terminal facilities are also
leased. Total rent expense was $313.5 million, $333.5 million, and $320.6 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Future minimum lease payments with noncancelable terms in excess of one year as of

December 31, 2008 are shown below (in millions):



Aircraft Commitments

In June 2005, Alaska entered into an aircraft purchase agreement to acquire B737-800 aircraft with deliveries beginning in January 2006 and continuing through April 2011. The
purchase agreement also includes options rights to purchase additional aircraft under similar terms. As of December 31, 2008, Alaska was committed to purchasing 20 B737-800 aircraft, 10 of which will be delivered in 2009.

Horizon entered into an aircraft purchase agreement in 2007 for 15 Q400 aircraft. As of
December 31, 2008, Horizon was committed to purchasing 13 Q400s, five of which will be delivered in 2009. Originally, the deliveries were to continue through August 2009. However,

Horizon has worked with
Bombardier to defer deliveries of eight of the aircraft into 2010 and 2011 in order to allow more time in marketing Horizon’s CRJ-700 aircraft as part of its transition to an all-Q400 fleet. Horizon has options to purchase an additional ten
Q400 aircraft.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had firm purchase commitments for
33 total aircraft requiring remaining aggregate payments of approximately $753.4 million.

Alaska and Horizon expect to finance the firm orders and, to the extent exercised, the option aircraft with leases, long-term debt, and internally generated cash.

NOTE 8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Four defined-benefit and five defined-contribution retirement plans cover various employee groups of
Alaska and Horizon. The defined-benefit plans provide benefits based on an employee’s term of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. Alaska also maintains an unfunded, noncontributory defined-benefit
plan for certain elected officers and an unfunded, non-contributory defined-contribution plan for other elected officers.

In 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

(SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s defined-benefit pension and other postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial statements and
requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income.

Qualified Defined-Benefit Pension Plans

The
Company’s pension plans are funded as required by the Employee Retirement Income

Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The defined-benefit plan assets consist primarily of marketable equity and fixed-income
securities. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for these plans.

Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31:

Discount rates of 6.20% and 6.00% were used as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For both 2008 and 2007, the rate of compensation increase used varied from 3.52% to
4.53%, depending on the plan and the related workgroup.

Weighted
average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31:

Discount rates of 6.00% and 5.75% were used for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For 2008 and 2007, the expected return on plan assets used was 7.75%, and the rate of compensation increase used
varied from 3.52% to 4.53%, depending on the plan and the related workgroup.



In determining the discount rate used, the Company’s policy is to use the rates near the end of the year on high-quality long-term bonds with maturities that
closely match the expected timing of future cash distributions from the plan. In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company assesses the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the
historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the
target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

The asset allocation of the qualified defined-benefit plans, by asset category, is as follows as of the end of 2008 and 2007:

The Company’s investment policy focuses on
achieving maximum returns at a reasonable risk for pension assets over a full market cycle. The Company uses a number of fund managers and invests in various asset classes to diversify risk. Target allocations for the primary asset classes are
approximately:

Domestic equities:


%

Non-U.S. equities:


%

Fixed income:


%

Pension assets are rebalanced periodically to
maintain these target asset allocations. An

individual equity investment will not exceed 10% of the entire equity portfolio. Fixed-income securities carry a minimum “A” rating by Moody’s and/or
Standard and Poor’s and the average life of the bond portfolio may not exceed ten years. The Company does not currently intend to invest plan assets in the Company’s common stock.

As a result of the overall decline in the financial markets in 2008, the pension assets experienced a
substantial reduction in value during the year as noted in the tables below. The Company is actively working with the fund managers to balance the portfolio in such a way as to maximize asset value.

Nonqualified Defined-Benefit Pension Plan

Alaska also maintains an unfunded, noncontributory defined-benefit plan for certain elected officers.
This plan uses a December 31 measurement date.

Weighted
average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31:

Discount rates of 6.20% and 6.00% were used as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The rate of compensation increase used was 5.00% as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the
years ended December 31:

Discount rates of 6.00% and 5.75% were used for
the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The rate of compensation increase used was 5.00% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.



Combined Disclosures for Defined-Benefit Pension Plans

The following table sets forth the status of the plans for 2008 and 2007 (in millions):

Of the total $1.1 billion PBO for the qualified
plans, approximately 59% represents the obligation of the plan covering Alaska’s pilots. The accumulated benefit obligation for the combined qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $1,017.9 million and $939.0 million at

December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for the nonqualified defined-benefit plan was $35.8 million and $34.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets were
as follows (in millions):

AMOUNTS NOT YET REFLECTED IN NET PERIODIC
BENEFIT COST AND INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS (AOCI):



The estimated amortization of prior service cost and net loss from AOCI in 2009 is $4.3 million and $28.9 million, respectively, for the qualified defined-benefit
pension plans. For the

nonqualified defined-benefit pension plans, the estimated amortization of prior service cost and net loss from AOCI in 2009 is $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

Net pension expense for the defined-benefit plans included the following components for 2008, 2007, and
2006 (in millions):

With the adoption of SFAS 158 in 2006, the
Company now records all of the unrecognized prior service cost and net loss into AOCI in order to fully recognize the funded status of the plans.

Although the qualified defined-benefit pension plans are below 60% funded, there are no benefit payment implications under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 as it pertains to
airlines.

Historically, the Company’s practice has been to contribute to the
qualified defined-benefit pension plans in an amount equal to at least the service cost. There are no current funding requirements for the Company’s plans in 2009. However, the Company anticipates that it will continue with its historical
funding practice in 2009, which would result in funding of approximately $48 million. The Company expects to contribute approximately $2.5 million to the nonqualified defined-benefit pension plans during 2009.

Future benefits expected to be paid over the next ten years under the defined-benefit pension plans
from the assets of those plans as of December 31, 2008 are as follows (in millions):

Postretirement Medical
Benefits

The Company allows retirees to continue their medical, dental, and
vision benefits by paying all or a portion of the active employee plan premium until eligible for Medicare, currently age 65. This results in a subsidy to retirees, because the premiums received by the Company are less than the actual cost of the
retirees’ claims. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for this subsidy is unfunded. This liability was determined using an assumed discount rate of 6.20% and 6.00% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):

The estimated amortization of prior service cost

The Company uses a December 31 measurement date to assess obligations associated with the subsidy of retiree medical costs. Net periodic benefit cost for the postretirement medical plans included the following components for 2008, 2007
and 2006 (in millions):

As this is a non-funded plan, the Company
expects to contribute approximately $4.4 million to the postretirement medical benefits plan in 2009, which is equal to the expected benefit payments.

Future benefits expected to be paid over the next ten years under the postretirement medical benefits plan as of December 31, 2008 are as follows (in millions):

The assumed health care cost trend rates to
determine the expected 2009 benefits cost are 8.8%, 9.6%, 5% and 4% for medical, prescription drugs, dental and vision costs, respectively. The assumed trend rate declines steadily through 2028 where the ultimate assumed trend rates are 4.7% for
medical, prescription drugs and dental, and 4% for vision. A 1% higher or lower trend rate in health care costs has the following effect on the Company’s postretirement medical plans during 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in millions):

Defined-Contribution Plans

The defined-contribution plans are deferred compensation plans under section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. All of these plans require Company contributions. Total expense for the defined-contribution plans was $27.5 million, $26.4 million, and $24.4 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

The Company also has a noncontributory, unfunded defined-contribution plan for certain elected officers
of the Company who are ineligible for the nonqualified defined-benefit



pension plan. Amounts recorded as liabilities under the plan are not material to the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Employee Incentive-Pay Plans

Alaska and Horizon have four separate plans that pay employees based on certain financial and
operational metrics. The aggregate expense under these plans in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $21.4 million, $20.8 million, $36.8 million, respectively. The plans are summarized below:

•

The

Profit Sharing Plan

is based on Air Group profitability. Alaska’s pilots, ramp service and clerical, office and passenger service employees, and certain
Horizon employees participate in this plan.

•

The

Variable Pay Plans

pay Alaska’s mechanics and Alaska’s flight attendants a percentage of their earnings as certain pretax margin levels are achieved.

•

Performance-Based Pay

is a program that rewards Alaska non-union employees and dispatchers, represented by TWU, and employees classified as supervisors and above at
Horizon, based on four separate metrics related to: (1) Air Group profitability, (2) safety, (3) achievement of unit-cost goals, and (4) employee engagement.

•

The

Operational Performance Rewards Program

entitles all Air Group employees to quarterly payouts of up to $300 per person if certain operational and customer service
objectives are met.

NOTE 10. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

As described in Note 1, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, effective for all stock options granted
beginning January 1, 2006. For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, for which the vesting period is not complete, the “modified prospective method” for transition permitted by SFAS 123R was used. Under this method, the
Company accounts for the unvested portion of these awards on a prospective basis, with expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning January 1, 2006 using the grant-date fair values previously calculated for
pro-forma disclosures.

See Note 16 for a discussion of an error in prior periods related
to stock-based compensation

and its impact on the Company’s operations and financial position.

Stock Options

The Company has stock option awards outstanding under a number of long-term incentive equity plans, only one of which (the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan) continues to
provide for the granting of options to purchase the Company’s common stock at market prices on the date of grant to directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Under the various plans, options for 7,909,606 shares
have been granted and, at December 31, 2008, 3,017,569 shares were available for future



grant of either options or stock awards. Under all plans, the stock options granted have terms of up to ten years. For all plans except the 1997 Long-term Incentive
Equity Plan (1997 Plan), when options are exercised, new common shares are issued. When options granted under the 1997 Plan are exercised, shares are issued from the Company’s treasury shares. The total number of outstanding options from the
1997 Plan as of

December 31, 2008 is 333,295. Substantially all grantees are 25% vested after one year, 50% after two years, 75% after three years, and 100% after four years. Compensation cost is recorded over
the shorter of the vesting period or the period between the grant date and the date the employee becomes retirement-eligible as defined in the applicable plan documents.

The tables below summarize stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2008:

The fair value of each option grant was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2008, 2007, and 2006:

The expected market price volatility of the
common stock is based on the historical volatility over a time period commensurate with the expected term of the awards. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect for the term nearest the expected term of the
option at the time of grant. The dividend yield is zero as the Company does not pay dividends and has no plans to do so in the immediate future. The expected term of the options and the expected forfeiture rates are based on historical experience
for various homogenous employee groups.

The Company recorded stock-based compensation
expense related to stock options of $5.1 million

($3.2 million, net of tax) and $4.7 million ($2.9 million, net of tax) in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2008 was
$0.2 million. Cash received from option exercises during 2008 totaled $0.8 million. A total of 240,603 options vested during 2008 with an aggregate fair value of $3.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, $3.7 million of compensation cost
associated with unvested stock option awards attributable to future service had not yet been recognized. This amount will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.



The following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2008 with their weighted-average
exercise prices and remaining contractual lives:

Restricted Stock Awards

The Company has restricted stock units (RSUs) outstanding under the 2004 and
2008 Long-term Incentive Equity Plans. As of December 31, 2008, 872,498 total RSUs have been granted under these plans. The RSUs are non-voting and are not eligible for dividends. The fair value of the RSU awards is based on the closing price
of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized over the shorter of three years from the date of grant as the awards “cliff vest” after three years, or the period from the date of grant to
the employee’s retirement eligibility. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs of $6.8 million ($4.3 million after tax) and $5.6 million ($3.5 million after tax) in 2008 and 2007, respectively. These amounts are
included in wages and benefits in the consolidated statements of operations.

The
following table summarizes information about outstanding RSUs:

As of December 31, 2008, $4.7 million of
compensation cost associated with unvested restricted stock awards attributable to future service had not yet been recognized. This amount will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

Performance Stock Awards

During the first quarters of 2008 and 2007, the Company awarded Performance Share Unit awards (PSUs)
to certain executives. PSUs are similar to RSUs, but vesting is based on a performance condition tied to the Company achieving a specified pretax margin over a three-year period. The PSU plan allows a portion of the PSUs to vest even if the
specified pretax margin falls below the target, and additional shares to be granted if the margin target is exceeded, subject to a maximum. The Company intends to regularly review its assumptions about meeting the performance goal and expected
vesting, and to adjust the related compensation expense accordingly. The current expectation is that none of the PSUs will ultimately vest and therefore, the full amount of previously recorded compensation expense of $0.4 million ($0.3 million after
tax) was reversed in 2008. The Company recorded compensation expense related to PSUs of $0.4 million ($0.3 million after tax) during 2007.



Deferred Stock Awards

In 2008, the Company awarded 13,976 Deferred Stock Unit awards (DSUs) to members of its Board of Directors as part of their retainers. The underlying common shares are issued upon
retirement from the Board, but require no future service period. As a result, the entire intrinsic value of the awards on the date of grant was expensed in 2008. The total amount of compensation expense recorded in 2008 was $0.3 million ($0.2
million after tax).

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company sponsors an ESPP, which qualifies under Section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can purchase Company common stock at 85% of the closing market price on the first day of the offering period or the quarterly purchase date, whichever is lower. Because of these
attributes, the ESPP is considered compensatory under SFAS 123R and as such, compensation cost is recognized. Compensation cost for the Company’s ESPP was $1.6 million in 2008 and 2007. The grant date fair value is calculated

using the Black-Scholes model in the same manner as the Company’s option awards for 85% of the share award plus the intrinsic value of the 15% discount. Proceeds received from the issuance of shares are credited to
stockholders’ equity in the period in which the shares are issued. In 2008 and 2007, 169,242 shares and 126,584 shares, respectively, were purchased by Company employees under the ESPP, resulting in cash proceeds of $3.2 million and $3.0
million, respectively.

Summary of Stock-Based Compensation

The table below summarizes the components of total stock-based compensation for
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006:

NOTE 11. INCOME TAXES

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48). The purpose of FIN 48 is to clarify certain aspects of the
recognition and measurement related to accounting for income tax uncertainties. Under FIN 48, the impact of an uncertain income tax position must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit by the
relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.

The Company was subject to the provisions of FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. Upon adoption, no cumulative effect of accounting change was necessary or recorded in the
consolidated financial statements. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was $26.2 million. This number includes a $24.5 million increase in the tax

liability and a corresponding
increase in deferred tax assets for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the implementation of FIN 48 and $1.7 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.

Changes in the FIN 48 liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2008 are as follows (in millions):

At December 31, 2008, the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits of $23.7 million includes $20.5 million recorded as a liability and a corresponding increase in deferred tax assets



and $1.2 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.

Accrued interest on tax positions is recorded as a component of interest expense. Total accrued interest on tax positions included in the FIN 48
liability was $2.0 million and $0.7 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. No penalties were accrued at December 31, 2008 or 2007.

The periods subject to examination for the Company’s federal income tax returns are the 2003 through 2007 tax years; however, the 2003 and 2004 tax returns are subject to
examination only to the extent of the net operating loss carryforwards from 2003 and 2004 that were utilized in 2005 and 2006. The periods subject to examination for the Company’s major state income tax returns other than California are also
the years 2003 through 2007. In California, the income tax years 2000 through 2007 remain open to examination. The 2000 to 2002 tax returns are subject to examination only to the extent of the net operating loss carryforwards from those years that
were utilized in 2005 and 2006.

The Company does not believe that it is reasonably
possible that the total unrecognized tax benefit would significantly increase or decrease in the next 12 months. The FIN 48 liability for the Company’s unrecognized tax benefit is classified in other liabilities (noncurrent) in the consolidated
balance sheets. The Company anticipates that total unrecognized tax benefits will not materially decrease due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for tax years prior to December 31, 2008.

During the first quarter of 2007, the Company received a favorable decision in a matter with the State
of California. As a result of the decision, the Company reduced its FIN 48 liability by $0.7 million, recorded a previously unrecognized tax benefit of $1.0 million, and accrued interest income of $1.5 million. The refund was received in August
2007.

Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts for tax purposes.

Deferred tax (assets) and liabilities comprise the following at December 31 (in millions):

*

State loss carryforwards of $72.8 million ($3.3 million tax effected) expire beginning in 2009 and ending in 2028.

The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realizable and thus no valuation allowance has been
recorded as of December 31, 2008. This conclusion is based on the expected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, anticipated future taxable income, and the potential for future tax planning strategies to generate taxable
income, if needed. Furthermore, absent the $196.4 million deferred tax asset associated with accumulated other comprehensive income (included in “Employee benefits” in the above table), the Company would be in a net deferred tax liability
position. The Company will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period.



The components of income tax expense (benefit) were as follows (in millions):

Income tax expense (benefit) reconciles to the
amount computed by applying the U.S. federal rate of 35% to income (loss) before income tax and accounting change as follows (in millions):

*

In 2007, other-net includes $1.0 million of tax benefits due to a favorable decision in a matter with the State of California and $1.0 million of tax benefits related to the recognition of
California income tax credit carryforwards. Other-net in 2006 includes $5.5 million of tax benefits associated with the reduction of certain tax contingency accruals for periods for which the statute of limitations expired in 2006.

NOTE 12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The majority of the Company’s financial instruments are carried at fair value. Those include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities (Note 5), securities lending collateral, restricted deposits (Note 9), and fuel
hedge contracts (Note 3). The Company’s long-term fixed-rate debt is not carried at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was as follows (in millions):

securities lending collateral (at December 31, 2007) approximates carrying values due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of fuel hedge contracts
is based on commodity exchange prices. The fair value of restricted deposits approximates the carrying amount. The fair value of long-term debt

is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using the Company’s
current borrowing rate.

Concentrations of Credit

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of,
the financial institutions that are counterparties to its fuel-hedging contracts and does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company could realize a loss in the event of nonperformance by any single counterparty to its fuel hedge positions. However, the Company enters into transactions only with
large, well-known financial institution counterparties that have strong credit ratings. In addition, the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.

The Company’s trade receivables do not represent a significant concentration of credit risk at December 31, 2008 due to the frequency that
settlement takes place and the dispersion across many industry and government segments.



NOTE 13. OPERATING
SEGMENT INFORMATION

SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,

as amended (SFAS 131), requires that a public company report annual and interim financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments, as defined, are components of
an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company has two primary operating and
reporting segments, consisting of Alaska and Horizon, for which financial information is presented below. These segments are more fully described in Note 1.



(1)

Alaska mainline revenue represents revenue from passengers aboard Alaska jets, freight and mail revenue, and all other revenue. Purchased capacity revenue represents that revenue earned by
Alaska on capacity provided by Horizon and a small third party under a capacity purchase arrangement.

(2)

Includes the parent company, Alaska Air Group, Inc., including its investments in Alaska and Horizon, which are eliminated in consolidation.

(3)

There are no interest or depreciation expenses associated with purchased capacity flying at Alaska, nor are there any associated assets or capital expenditures.

(4)

Capital expenditures include aircraft deposits, net of deposits returned.

NOTE 14. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In September 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100 million of
its common stock. The Company completed the $100 million common stock repurchase program on February 29, 2008. Under that program, the Company repurchased 4,113,782 shares, or 10% of the outstanding stock at the start of the program, at an
average price of $24.31 per share. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 1,520,500 shares for approximately $37.2 million.

In March 2008, the Company announced a new $50 million common stock repurchase program that expires in March 2009. During 2008, the Company had repurchased 605,700 shares of its
common stock for approximately $11.7 million under this new program. In April 2008, the Company temporarily ceased further repurchases under this program given the uncertainty in the economic environment and currently does not expect to repurchase
any more shares prior to the expiration date.

NOTE 15. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS)

Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the average common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would have been outstanding assuming the
exercise of in-the-money stock options and restricted stock units, using the treasury-stock method. As the Company reported a net loss in

2008, no outstanding stock options or restricted stock units were used in
the calculation of diluted weighted average shares as the effect would have been antidilutive. In 2007 and 2006, 1.7 million and 2.5 million stock options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because they were
antidilutive.



NOTE 16. IMPACT OF
PRIOR PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS AND STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108 (SAB 108)

Previously reported results have been adjusted as described below.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense Adjustment

In the third
quarter of 2008, the Company discovered an error in its calculation of stock-based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123R for certain awards granted after January 1, 2006. The error related to the time period over which compensation
expense was recorded. The Company had been recording compensation expense over the vesting period, which was deemed to be the service period. However, many employees who receive award grants are eligible for retirement or will be eligible for
retirement prior to the end of the vesting period. The award plans allow for continued vesting subsequent to retirement. As such the related compensation expense should be recorded over the shorter of the vesting period or the period from the date
of grant to the date the employee is eligible for retirement. The error resulted in a $2.3 million understatement of wages and benefits expense in the first quarter of 2008, a $1.1 million understatement of expense in 2007 and a $2.9 million
understatement of expense in 2006. The Company has concluded that this item is not material, and in accordance with SAB 108, the Company has adjusted the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 accordingly. There was no impact to cash flows. See
the tables below for further details.

Additionally, the Company will adjust its
previously filed financial statements for the impact on the first quarter 2008 information when it is presented in the first quarter 2009 Form 10Q.

Reconciliation Between Amounts Previously Reported and Corrected Amounts

The impact of each of the corrections on financial statement line items is presented below (in millions):

Consolidated Statements of Operations:



Consolidated Balance Sheet:

Adoption of SAB 108

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108. SAB 108 expresses SEC staff views regarding the process by
which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether those misstatements are material to the Company’s financial statements. SAB 108 was effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006.
The transition provisions of the bulletin permitted the Company to adjust beginning retained earnings for the cumulative effect of immaterial errors relating to prior years. The Company adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of 2006, with an
effective date of January 1, 2006. In accordance with the bulletin, the Company adjusted beginning retained earnings for 2006 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the items described below. Management of the Company
considers these adjustments to be immaterial to prior periods.

Depreciation of Leasehold Improvements

Historically,
leasehold improvements at airports were generally depreciated over their estimated useful lives due to the expectation that the underlying lease would be renewed for at least the period over which the leasehold improvements were being depreciated.
In 2005, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the

Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued interpretive guidance clarifying its position that leasehold improvements in an operating lease should
be depreciated by the lessee over the shorter of their economic lives or the remaining lease term, as defined in SFAS 13. Our airport lease agreements do not generally carry a renewal right in them, which is a key consideration for SFAS 13
“lease term” definitions.

The difference between the depreciation expense
recorded and the depreciation expense that would have been recorded had the Company depreciated those leasehold improvements using the shorter life of the lease term was not material to the consolidated statements of operations in any individual
year, nor was the accumulated difference deemed material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. However, the accumulated difference would have been material to the consolidated statements of operations. As such, in order to correct the
accumulated depreciation of leasehold improvements to depreciate them over the shorter of their economic lives or the remaining lease term, the Company adjusted its beginning retained earnings for 2006.

Horizon Fleet Subsidy

In connection with the purchase of certain aircraft, the manufacturer paid Horizon a “market
subsidy” payment as an inducement to purchase larger aircraft. This market subsidy was paid quarterly for seven years for Q200 aircraft and eight years for Q400 aircraft following delivery of the aircraft.

Previously, the fleet subsidy credit was recognized as the cash was received, i.e. over the payment
period. However, upon further review, management determined that the correct method of accounting would have been to recognize the credit ratably over the full lease term of the aircraft, generally 15 to 17 years, rather than at the time of the cash
payments.



The difference between the Company’s historical accounting practice and the current practice for income statement recognition was not material to the consolidated
statements of operations in any individual year, nor was the deferred credit that should have been recorded deemed material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. However, the accumulated difference would have been material to the
consolidated statements of operations. As such, in order to correct the amount of deferred credit recognized, the Company adjusted its beginning retained earnings for 2006.

Impact of Adjustments

The impact of each of the items noted above, net of tax, on 2006 beginning balances are presented below (in millions):

NOTE 17. CONTINGENCIES

Grievance with International Association of Machinists

In June 2005, the International Association of Machinists (IAM) filed a grievance under its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with Alaska alleging that Alaska violated the CBA by, among other things, subcontracting the ramp
service operation in Seattle. The dispute was referred to an arbitrator and hearings on the grievance commenced in January 2007, with a final hearing date in August 2007. In July 2008, the arbitrator issued a final decision in the matter. In that
decision, the arbitrator found that Alaska had violated the CBA and instructed Alaska and the IAM to negotiate a remedy. The parties have met, but the matter has not yet been resolved. Another arbitration hearing has been tentatively set for June
2009. Management currently does not believe that any final remedy

will materially impact our financial position or results of operations.

Other items

The Company is a party to routine litigation matters incidental to its business and with respect to which no material liability is expected.

Management believes the ultimate disposition of the matters discussed above is not likely to materially
affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. This forward-looking statement is based on management’s current understanding of the relevant law and facts, and it is subject to various contingencies, including the
potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of arbitrators, judges and juries.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of December 31, 2008, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (collectively, our “certifying
officers”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our current and
periodic reports filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our certifying officers, on a timely basis. Our certifying officers concluded, based on their evaluation, that disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2008.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

There were no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting identified in management’s evaluation during the year ended December 31, 2008, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the
COSO Framework). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

We intend to regularly review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and to improve these controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting are effective, future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our controls and procedures.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report regarding its assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008, which report appears on page 99.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Alaska Air Group, Inc.:

We have audited Alaska Air Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Alaska Air Group, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Alaska Air Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Alaska Air Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 18, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
