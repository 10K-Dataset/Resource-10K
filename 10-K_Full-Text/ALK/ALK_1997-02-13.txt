PART I

ITEM 1.	BUSINESS

GENERAL INFORMATION
Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group or the Company) is a holding company 
which was incorporated in Delaware in 1985.  Its two principal subsidiaries 
are Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. 
(Horizon).  Both subsidiaries operate as airlines.  However, each 
subsidiary's business plan, competition and economic risks differ 
substantially.  Alaska is a major airline, operates an all jet fleet, and 
its average passenger trip length is 833 miles.  Horizon is a regional 
airline, operates jet and turboprop aircraft, and its average passenger 
trip is 231 miles. Business segment information is reported in the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company's executive offices are 
located at 19300 Pacific Highway South, Seattle, Washington 98188.  The 
business of the Company is somewhat seasonal.  Quarterly operating income 
tends to peak during the third quarter.

Alaska
Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation which was organized in 1932 and 
incorporated in 1937.  Alaska serves 35 cities in six states (Alaska, 
Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada and Arizona), one city in Canada, 
four cities in Mexico and four cities in Russia.  In each year since 1973, 
Alaska has carried more passengers between Alaska and the U.S. mainland 
than any other airline.    In 1996, Alaska carried 11.8 million passengers.  
Passenger traffic within Alaska and between Alaska and the U.S. mainland 
accounted for 26% of Alaska's 1996 revenue passenger miles, West Coast 
traffic accounted for 66%, the Mexico markets 8% and Russia less than 1%.  
Based on passenger enplanements, Alaska's leading airports are Seattle, 
Portland, Anchorage and Los Angeles.  Based on revenues, its leading 
nonstop routes are Seattle-Anchorage, Seattle-Los Angeles and Seattle-San 
Diego.  At December 31, 1996, Alaska's operating fleet consisted of 74 jet 
aircraft.  The majority of Alaska flights and certain Northwest flights are 
dual-designated in airline computer reservation systems as Alaska Airlines 
and Northwest Airlines in order to facilitate feed traffic between the two 
airlines.  Alaska Airlines also serves three smaller cities in California, 
two in Washington, and many small communities in Alaska through code share 
marketing agreements with local carriers.

Horizon
Horizon, a Washington corporation, began service in 1981 and was acquired 
by Air Group in 1986.  It is the largest regional airline in the Pacific 
Northwest, and serves 35 cities in five states (Washington, Oregon, 
Montana, Idaho, and California) and four cities in Canada.  In 1996, 
Horizon carried 3.8 million passengers.  Based on passenger enplanements, 
Horizon's leading airports are Seattle, Portland, Spokane and Boise.  Based 
on revenues, its leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Portland, Seattle-
Spokane and Seattle-Boise.  At December 31, 1996, Horizon's operating fleet 
consisted of 15 jet and 47 turboprop aircraft. Horizon flights are listed 
under the Alaska Airlines designator code in airline computer reservation 
systems.  Most Horizon flights are also dual-designated in these 
reservation systems as Northwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines.  Currently, 
30% of Horizon's passengers connect to either Alaska or Northwest.

Alaska and Horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide the best 
possible service between any two points served by their systems.  Both 
airlines distinguish themselves from competitors by providing a higher 
level of customer service.  The airlines' excellent service in the form of 
advance seat assignments, a first class section, attention to customer 
needs, high-quality food and beverage service, well-maintained aircraft and 
other amenities has been recognized by independent studies and surveys of 
air travelers.  Alaska and Horizon offer competitive fares. 

BUSINESS RISKS
The Company's operations and financial results are subject to various 
uncertainties such as intense competition, volatile fuel prices, a largely 
unionized labor force, the need to finance large capital expenditures, 
adverse weather, government regulation and general economic conditions.

Competition
Competition in the air transportation industry is intense.  Any domestic 
air carrier deemed fit by the DOT is allowed to operate scheduled passenger 
service in the United States.  Together, Alaska and Horizon carry 2.3% of 
all U.S. domestic passenger traffic.  Alaska's and Horizon's primary 
competitors in the West Coast, Arizona and Nevada markets are America West, 
Delta, Reno Air, Shuttle by United, Southwest Airlines, United and United 
Express.  Alaska also competes with America West, Continental, Delta, Reno 
Air and United in the Lower 48-to-Alaska market, and with Aeromexico, 
America West, Delta and Mexicana in its Mexico markets.  Some of these 
competitors are substantially larger than Alaska and Horizon, have greater 
financial resources and have more extensive route systems.  Due to its 
shorthaul markets, Horizon is also subject to competition from surface 
transportation, particularly the private automobile.

Most major U.S. carriers have developed, independently or in partnership 
with others, large computerized reservation systems (CRS).  Due to 
contractual requirements imposed by CRSs, most travel agencies contract 
with a single CRS to sell tickets.  Airlines, including Alaska, and 
Horizon, are charged industry-set fees to have their flight schedules 
included in the various CRS displays.  These systems are currently the 
predominant means of distributing airline tickets.  In order to reduce 
anti-competitive practices, the DOT regulates the display of all airline 
schedules and fares.  Alaska is exploring alternatives to existing 
distribution methods.

Fuel
Fuel costs represented 16% of the Company's total operating expenses in 
1996.  Fuel prices, which can be volatile and are largely outside of the 
Company's control, can have a significant impact on the Company's operating 
results.  Currently, a one cent change in the fuel price per gallon affects 
annual fuel costs by approximately $3.1 million.

Unionized Labor Force
Labor costs represented 32% of the Company's total operating expenses in 
1996.  Wage rates can have a significant impact on the Company's operating 
results.  At December 31, 1996, labor unions represented 87% of Alaska's 
and 27% of Horizon's employees.  The air transportation industry is 
regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National 
Mediation Board certain regulatory powers with respect to disputes between 
airlines and labor unions.  The Company cannot predict the outcome of union 
contract negotiations nor control actions (e.g. work stoppage or slowdown) 
unions might take to try to influence those negotiations.

Leverage and Future Capital Requirements
The Company, like many airlines, is highly leveraged, which increases the 
volatility of its earnings.  In addition, the Company has an ongoing need 
to finance new aircraft deliveries and there is no assurance that such 
financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.  
See Item 7 for management's discussion of liquidity and capital resources.

Weather
Unusually adverse weather, as occurred during December 1996 in the Pacific 
Northwest, can significantly reduce flight operations, resulting in lost 
revenues and added expenses.

Government Regulation
The Company, like other airlines, is subject to regulation by the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) and the United States Department of 
Transportation (DOT).  The FAA, under its mandate to ensure aviation 
safety, has the authority to ground aircraft and to suspend temporarily or 
revoke permanently the authority of an air carrier or its licensed 
personnel for failure to comply with Federal Aviation Regulations and to 
levy civil penalties for such failure.  The DOT has the authority to 
regulate certain airline economic functions including financial and 
statistical reporting, consumer protection, computerized reservations 
systems, essential air transportation and international route authority. 

OTHER INFORMATION
Frequent Flyer Program
All major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of 
increasing passenger loyalty.  Alaska's Mileage Plan allows members to earn 
mileage by flying on Alaska, Horizon and other participating airlines, and 
by using the services of non-airline partners which include a credit card, 
telephone companies, hotels and car rental agencies.  Alaska is paid by 
non-airline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts.  Alaska 
has the ability to change the Mileage Plan terms, conditions, partners, 
mileage credits and award levels.

Mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel 
industry awards.  Upon accumulating the necessary mileage, members notify 
Alaska of their award selection  Over 70% of the flight awards selected are 
subject to blackout dates and capacity-controlled seating.  Effective in 
January 1996, all miles will accumulate indefinitely.  As of the year end 
1995 and 1996, Alaska estimates that 481,000 and 504,000 round trip flight 
awards could have been redeemed by Mileage Plan members who have mileage 
credits exceeding the 20,000 mile free round trip domestic ticket award 
threshold.  At December 31, 1996, fewer than 6% of these flight awards were 
issued and outstanding.  For the years 1994, 1995 and 1996, approximately 
226,000, 242,000 and 173,000 round trip flight awards were redeemed and 
flown on Alaska and Horizon.  These awards represent approximately 5% for 
1994, 7% for 1995, and 4% for 1996, of the total passenger miles flown for 
each period.

Alaska maintains a liability for its Mileage Plan obligation which is based 
on its total miles outstanding, less an estimate for miles which will never 
be redeemed.  The net miles outstanding are allocated between those 
credited for travel on Alaska, Horizon or other airline partners and those 
credited for using the services of non-airline partners.  Miles credited 
for travel on Alaska, Horizon or other airline partners are accrued at 
Alaska's incremental cost of providing the air travel.  The incremental 
cost includes the cost of meals, fuel, reservations and insurance.  The 
incremental cost does not include a contribution to overhead, aircraft cost 
or profit.  A portion of the proceeds received from non-airline partners is 
also deferred.  At December 31, 1995 and 1996, the total liability for 
miles outstanding was $17.5 million and $17.3 million, respectively.

Employees
Alaska had 8,406 active full-time and part-time employees at December 31, 
1996.  The following is a summary of Alaska's union contracts as of 
December 31, 1996:

International Routes
International operating authority is subject to bilateral agreements 
between the United States and the respective countries.  The countries 
establish the number of carriers to provide service, approve the carriers 
selected to provide such service and the size of aircraft to be used.  The 
DOT reviews the carriers authorized under bilateral agreements every five 
years.  Beginning in February 1997, under the U.S.-Canada "open skies" 
agreement, all U.S. and Canadian carriers will be able to operate between 
U.S. and Canadian cities (except for Toronto), subject to availability of 
landing slots.  Alaska's authorities to serve its various Mexico and Russia 
destinations are to be reviewed during 1997-2002 and 1998-2001, 
respectively. The Company expects to be granted authority to continue to 
operate its international routes.

The amounts shown for operating income for the second, third and fourth 
quarters of 1995 and for the first and second quarters of 1996 differ from 
those previously reported due to the reclassification (in accordance with 
new Financial Accounting Standard 121) of gain or loss on sale of assets 
from nonoperating to operating income.  The total of the amounts shown as 
quarterly earnings per share may differ from the amount shown on the 
Consolidated Statement of Income because the annual computation is made 
separately and is based upon average number of shares and equivalent shares 
outstanding for the year.

Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of 
Operations and Financial Condition," discusses future orders and options 
for additional aircraft.

Eleven of the 23 aircraft owned by Alaska as of December 31, 1996 are 
subject to liens securing long-term debt.  Alaska's leased B737-200C, B737-
400 and MD-80 aircraft have lease expiration dates between 1997 and 1999, 
2002 and 2014, and 1997 and 2013, respectively.  Horizon's leased Fairchild 
Metroliner III, Dornier 328, de Havilland Dash 8 and Fokker F-28 aircraft 
have expiration dates between 1997 and 2001, 2008 and 2011, 1999 and 2006, 
and 1997 and 2001, respectively.  However, as part of its fleet 
standardization plan, Horizon expects to return to the lessors all of the 
leased Dorniers during 1997 and all of the Metroliners by the end of 1998.  
Alaska and Horizon have the option to extend most of the leases for 
additional periods, or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the 
lease term, usually at the then fair market value of the aircraft.  For 
information regarding obligations under capital leases and long-term 
operating leases, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Special noise ordinances or agreements restrict the type of aircraft, the 
timing and the number of flights operated by Alaska and other air carriers 
at four Los Angeles area airports plus San Diego, Palm Springs, San 
Francisco and Seattle.  Alaska's only Stage II aircraft (under the Airport 
Noise and Capacity Act of 1990) are eight Boeing 737-200Cs, and the Company 
plans to modify these aircraft in 1997-1999 to meet applicable noise 
requirements.

Ground Facilities and Services
Alaska and Horizon lease ticket counters, gates, cargo and baggage, office 
space and other support areas at the majority of the airports they serve.  
Alaska also owns terminal buildings at various Alaska cities.

Alaska has centralized operations in several buildings located at or near 
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) in Seattle, Washington.  The 
owned buildings, including land unless located on leased airport property, 
include: a three-bay hangar facility with maintenance shops; a flight 
operations and training center; an air cargo facility; a reservation and 
office facility; a four-story office building; its corporate headquarters; 
and two storage warehouses.  Alaska also leases a two-bay hangar/office 
facility at Sea-Tac.   

Alaska's other major facilities include: its Anchorage regional 
headquarters building and Phoenix reservations center; a leased two-bay 
maintenance facility in Oakland; and a leased hangar/office facility in 
Anchorage.  A new $8 million air cargo facility is under construction in 
Anchorage and is expected to be completed in mid-1998.

Horizon owns its Seattle corporate headquarters building and leases 
maintenance facilities at the Portland and Boise airports.


ITEM 3.	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In October 1991, Alaska gave notice of termination of its code sharing and 
frequent flyer relationship with MarkAir, an airline based in the state of 
Alaska.  Both companies have filed suit against one another in connection 
with that termination alleging breach of contract and other causes of 
action under state law.  In addition, MarkAir claimed that the termination 
was in violation of Federal Antitrust Laws.  In June 1992, MarkAir filed 
for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  In December 
1993, MarkAir dismissed all antitrust claims against the Company.  
Discovery continues in a related Alaska state court case pertaining to 
breach of contract and other state law claims.

In August 1996, Horizon gave notice of termination of its aircraft leases 
and purchase agreement with Dornier, a German aircraft manufacturer, 
because Dornier failed to meet certain contractual conditions.  In late 
1996, after attempts to renegotiate the agreement and resolve the problems 
failed, Horizon exercised its right to terminate the agreements and 
returned two of the 12 leased aircraft.  Horizon intends to return the 
remaining 10 aircraft during 1997.  Dornier disputes Horizon's right to 
return the aircraft.  The purchase agreement requires the arbitration of 
disputes.  Horizon has filed its petition for arbitration, and Dornier has 
filed an answer.

The Company believes the ultimate resolution of the above legal proceedings 
will not result in a material adverse impact on the financial position or 
results of operations of the Company.

ITEM 7.	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
FINANCIAL CONDITION

Industry Conditions
During the last several years the character of competition has changed on 
the West Coast due to the purchase of Morris Air by Southwest Airlines and 
the start-up of Shuttle by United.  Low air fares are now a permanent part 
of the fare structure on the West Coast.  During 1995, MarkAir (a 
significant competitor in the Alaska marketplace since 1992) ceased 
operations and Reno Air began flying to Alaska.  During 1996, America West 
began flying to Alaska and United ceased flying from Seattle to Alaska.

The U.S. 10% passenger ticket tax, the 6.25% cargo waybill tax and the $6 
per passenger international departure tax expired on December 31, 1995, and 
were all reinstated effective August 27, 1996.  These taxes expired on 
December 31, 1996.  Management believes that some form of these taxes will 
likely be reinstated in 1997 and that it is unlikely that any reinstatement 
will be retroactive.  The seven largest U.S. airlines have proposed a user 
fee to replace the 10% passenger ticket tax.  The U.S. General Accounting 
Office has determined that the proposed user fee would benefit the seven 
largest airlines at the expense of smaller airlines.  The Company is 
opposed to the proposed user fee because it would effectively transfer 
hundreds of millions of dollars of operating costs to smaller airlines, 
such as Alaska and Horizon.

During 1996, fuel prices increased significantly for the Company and most 
of its competitors (approximately 20% or 12 cents per gallon for Alaska 
Airlines).

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
1996 Compared with 1995  Consolidated net income in 1996 was $38.0 million, 
or $2.65 per share (primary) and $2.05 per share (fully diluted), compared 
with net income of $17.3 million, or $1.28 per share (primary) and $1.26 
per share (fully diluted) in 1995.  Consolidated operating income was $89.0 
million in 1996 compared to $75.7 million in 1995.  Alaska's operating 
income improved by $17.7 million, but it was offset by lower operating 
results at Horizon.  A discussion of operating results for the two airlines 
follows.

Alaska Airlines  Operating income increased 24.5% to $90.0 million, 
resulting in a 6.9% operating margin as compared to a 6.3% margin in 1995.  
Operating income increased in each of the first three quarters, but 
decreased in the fourth quarter as a result of higher fuel prices, canceled 
flights due to extreme weather during the last week of December, and 
matching of competitor's lower fares.  1996 operating revenue per available 
seat mile (RASM) increased 5.8% to 8.70 cents while operating expenses per 
available seat mile increased 5.1% to 8.10 cents.

The increase in RASM was primarily due to a 4.2 point improvement in system 
passenger load factor.  The Pacific Northwest to the Bay Area and to 
Southern California markets (which compose half of the system) experienced 
a 6.8 point increase in load factor.  Changes in passenger yield varied 
from a 3.4% increase in the first quarter to a 1.4% decrease in the fourth 
quarter, resulting in a slight increase of 0.7% for the full year.  
Increased yield in the first half of 1996 is believed to be due in part to 
the absence of the 10% passenger transportation tax.  Decreased yield in 
the second half of 1996 was due to lower fares in the Seattle-Anchorage and 
Mexico markets.
Freight and mail revenues decreased 1.7% reflecting increased competition 
in the Alaska markets.  Other-net revenues rose 6.8% primarily due to 
increased revenues from partners in Alaska's frequent flyer program.

The table below shows the major operating expense elements on a cost per 
available seat mile (ASM) basis in 1995 and 1996.

Alaska Airlines	Operating Expenses Per ASM (In Cents)

Alaska's higher unit costs were largely due to higher fuel prices and 
heavier passenger loads.  Significant unit cost changes are discussed 
below.

Revenue passengers increased 16.4%.  Employees increased 9% primarily due 
to increases in reservation and customer service employees.  Wages and 
benefits per employee (excluding profit sharing) increased 2.5% due to 
annual wage increases and a higher cost of fringe benefits, offset by lower 
wages for new hires.  The net effect was that wages and benefits increased 
more than ASMs, resulting in a 4% increase in cost per ASM.

Fuel expense per ASM increased 22%, due to a 20% increase in the price of 
fuel.  Approximately one fourth of the 12.3 cent fuel price increase was 
due to a 4.3 cent Federal excise tax on domestic fuel consumption that 
began October 1, 1995.  Currently, a 1 cent change in fuel prices affects 
annual fuel costs by approximately $2.7 million.

Maintenance expense per ASM increased 15% primarily due to higher 
amortization of major airframe and engine overhaul costs.  Commission 
expense per ASM increased 9% because passenger revenues, upon which 
commissions are paid, increased more than ASM growth.  Commission expense 
as a percentage of passenger revenue was 7.7% in 1996 versus 7.6% in 1995.

Depreciation and amortization expense per ASM decreased 10% primarily due 
to the sale (and leaseback) of two aircraft in early 1996 and a 4% increase 
in aircraft utilization.

The gain on sale of assets in 1996 is primarily due to the sale of three 
jet aircraft.  A new accounting standard requires that gains or losses on 
long-lived assets be included in operating income.

Horizon Air  Operating income decreased 98% to $0.1 million, resulting in a 
0.0% operating margin as compared to a 1.5% margin in 1995.  The decrease 
was primarily attributable to the fourth quarter, which was negatively 
impacted by adverse weather, increased competition, higher than normal 
maintenance expense and costs associated with transitioning to a simplified 
fleet.  For 1996, operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) 
increased 4.2% to 20.61 cents while operating expenses per available seat 
mile increased 5.8% to 20.60 cents.

The increase in RASM was primarily due to a 5.3% increase in passenger 
yield.  Changes in passenger yield varied from an 8.9% increase in the 
second quarter to a 0.5% decrease in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 
5.3% increase for the full year.  Increased yields in the first three 
quarters of 1996 are believed to be due in part to the absence of the 10% 
passenger transportation tax.  Yields were also favorably impacted by 
reduced flying in the lower-yield Seattle-Spokane and Portland-Spokane 
markets.  The system passenger load factor decreased 0.2 points due to a 
shift in flying from high load factor markets like Seattle-Spokane to low 
load factor new markets like Seattle-Edmonton.

Freight and mail revenues increased 0.9% due to increased capacity, while 
other-net revenues decreased 26.3% due to reductions in revenues from 
providing services to other airlines.

The table below shows the major operating expense elements on a cost per 
ASM basis for Horizon in 1995 and 1996.

                              		1995    	1996    	Change    	% Change

Horizon Air Total	             19.47   	20.60     	1.13        	 6
NM = Not Meaningful

Horizon's unit costs increased 6% primarily due to: (a) higher wage rates 
and fringe benefits costs; (b) 18% higher fuel prices; (c) increased 
maintenance expense on Dash 8 aircraft; and (d) higher overhaul expense on 
leased aircraft that will be returned to lessors earlier than originally 
planned.

Consolidated Other Income (Expense)  Non-operating expense decreased from 
$41.7 million to $24.7 million primarily due to lower interest rates on 
variable debt and smaller average debt balances.  In addition, 1995 
included a $2.2 million write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs for 
the 7-1/4% zero coupon notes that were redeemed in August 1995.

1995 Compared with 1994  Consolidated net income in 1995 was $17.3 million, 
or $1.28 per share (primary) and $1.26 per share (fully diluted), compared 
with net income of $22.5 million, or $1.68 per share (primary) and $1.62 
per share (fully diluted) in 1994.  Consolidated operating income was $75.7 
million compared to $74.0 million in 1994.  Alaska's operating income 
improved by $10.4 million, but it was offset by significantly lower 
operating results at Horizon

Alaska Airlines  Operating income increased 16.8% to $72.3 million, 
resulting in a 6.3% operating margin as compared to a 5.8% margin in 1994.  
Operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) decreased 6.4% to 8.23 
cents while operating expenses per available seat mile decreased 6.8% to 
7.71 cents.  The decrease in RASM was primarily due to a 5.0% decrease in 
passenger yield, reflecting increased competition on the West Coast.  Lower 
unit costs were due to improved employee productivity and a 5% increase in 
average daily aircraft utilization.

Horizon Air  Operating income decreased 67.1% to $4.2 million, resulting in 
a 1.5% operating margin as compared to a 5.0% margin in 1994.  Operating 
revenue per available seat mile (RASM) decreased 10.4% to 19.77 cents while 
operating expenses per available seat mile decreased 7.1% to 19.47 cents.  
The decrease in RASM was due to a 5.6% decrease in passenger yield 
(reflecting increased competition and longer passenger trips), and a 3.4 
point drop in passenger load factor.  Lower unit costs were due to greater 
use of higher capacity aircraft, no employee profit sharing in 1995 and 
cost reduction efforts.

Consolidated Other Income (Expense)  Non-operating expense increased from 
$33.0 million to $41.7 million primarily due to higher interest rates on 
variable debt and larger average debt balances.  In addition, 1995 included 
more debt issuance expense, fewer vendor credits and lower gains on debt 
retirements than in 1994.

1996 Financial Changes  The Company's cash and marketable securities 
portfolio decreased by $33 million during 1996.  Operating activities 
provided $223 million of cash in 1996.  Additional cash was provided by the 
sale and leaseback of three B737-400 aircraft ($86 million), the sale of 
three MD-80 aircraft ($52 million) and proceeds received from the issuance 
of common stock ($21 million).  Cash was used for the purchase of two new 
MD-83 aircraft, two used B737-400 aircraft, two previously leased B737-
200Cs, airframe and engine overhauls and other capital expenditures ($209 
million), and aircraft purchase deposits ($61 million).  Cash was also used 
to repay net short-term borrowings ($19 million), and $134 million of long-
term debt (including $100 million repaid early).

Like most airlines, the Company has a working capital deficit.  The 
existence of a working capital deficit has not in the past impaired the 
Company's ability to meet its obligations as they become due and it is not 
expected to do so in the future.

Shareholders' equity increased by $60 million primarily due to net income 
of $38 million and the issuance of $21 million of common stock under stock 
plans.  These factors, combined with the early repayment of debt, increased 
equity to 40% of capital, an improvement of 11 percentage points.

Financing Arrangements   During 1996, Alaska sold and leased back three 
B737-400 aircraft for approximately 18 years, and replaced its $75 million 
credit facility with a $125 million credit facility with substantially the 
same terms and conditions.

Commitments  During 1996, Alaska's lease commitments increased 
approximately $141 million due to the sale and leaseback of three B737-400 
aircraft.  In addition, Alaska ordered 12 Boeing 737-400 aircraft along 
with an option to acquire 12 more.  The value of the firm commitments, 
based on the manufacturer's list price, is about $540 million.  The new 
B737-400s will be phased in over the next three years, with the first plane 
scheduled to enter the fleet in June 1997.  The new planes are intended to 
replace 12 older McDonnell Douglas MD-80s.  During 1996 Alaska sold three 
MD-80s and plans to return three more to lessors in 1997.  Horizon ordered 
25 de Havilland Dash 8-200 aircraft along with an option to acquire 45 
more.  The value of the firm commitments, based on the manufacturer's list 
price, is about $270 million.  Alaska and Horizon expect to finance the new 
planes with either leases, long-term debt or internally generated cash.

At December 31, 1996, the Company had firm orders for 40 aircraft with a 
total cost of approximately $925 million as set forth below.
	
                            	Delivery Period - Firm Orders

Cost (Millions)        			$390    	$445     	$90     	$925

The Company accrues the costs associated with returning leased aircraft 
over the lease period.  As leased aircraft are retired, the costs are 
charged against the established reserve.  At December 31, 1996, $39 million 
was reserved for leased aircraft returns. 

Deferred Taxes  At December 31, 1996, net deferred tax liabilities were $39 
million, which includes $101 million of net temporary differences, offset 
by $18 million of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and $44 million of 
Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credits.  The Company believes that all of 
its deferred tax assets, including the NOL and AMT credits, will be 
realized through the reversal of existing temporary differences or tax 
planning strategies such as the sale of aircraft.

1995 Financial Changes The Company's cash and marketable securities 
portfolio increased by $30 million during 1995.  Operating activities 
provided $126 million of cash in 1995.  Additional cash was provided by 
flight equipment deposits returned ($11 million), net short-term borrowings 
($41 million), the sale and leaseback of two B737-400 aircraft ($56 
million) and new long-term debt proceeds ($129 million).  Cash was used for 
the purchase of one previously leased B737-400 aircraft, airframe and 
engine overhauls and other capital expenditures ($103 million) and the 
repayment of debt and capital lease obligations ($237 million).  Included 
in the above numbers are the June 1995 issuance of $132.3 million of 6-1/2% 
convertible senior debentures due 2005, and the August 1995 redemption of 
the 7-1/4% zero coupon, convertible subordinated notes for $127.7 million

1994 Financial Changes Cash and marketable securities increased by $4 
million in 1994.  Operations generated $144 million, proceeds from 
financing four new MD-83 aircraft were $104 million, and net short-term 
borrowings added $5 million.  Cash was used for the repayment of debt ($71 
million) and capital expenditures ($189 million).  During 1994, Alaska 
restructured its 20 B737-400 aircraft leases.  The fixed term of the leases 
was increased from eight years to ten years.  As a result of the 
restructuring, Alaska expects to save more than $6 million per year over 
the term of the leases.  As part of the restructuring, Alaska purchased one 
of the leased aircraft in 1994, agreed to purchase one each in 1995 and 
1996, and received options to purchase up to four more of the 20 between 
1997 and 1999.  Capital lease obligations increased $57.9 million due to 
changes in the lease agreements for two B737-400 aircraft that were 
previously classified as operating leases.  Also during 1994, Alaska 
further restructured its aircraft orders with McDonnell Douglas, replacing 
an order for ten MD-90s plus options with an order for four MD-83s.  This 
restructuring will reduce future capital spending by $360 million.

EFFECT OF INFLATION  Inflation and specific price changes do not have a 
significant effect on the Company's operating revenues, operating expenses 
and operating income, because such revenues and expenses generally reflect 
current price levels.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Alaska Air Group, Inc.
December 31, 1996

Note 1.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alaska Air 
Group, Inc. (Company or Air Group) and its subsidiaries, the principal 
subsidiaries being Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air 
Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  All significant intercompany transactions are 
eliminated.  Preparation of financial statements requires the use of 
management's estimates.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years' financial 
statements to conform to the 1996 presentation.

Alaska and Horizon operate as airlines.  However, each airline's business 
plan, competition and economic risks differ substantially due to the 
passenger capacity and range of aircraft operated.  Alaska is a major 
airline serving Alaska, the West Coast, Mexico and Eastern Russia.  It 
operates an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is 833 miles.  
Horizon is a regional airline serving the Pacific Northwest, Northern 
California and Western Canada.  It operates both jet and turboprop 
aircraft, and its average passenger trip is 231 miles.  See Note 9 for 
business segment information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. They are carried at cost, which 
approximates market.  The Company reduces its cash on hand when checks are 
disbursed.  Due to the time delay in checks clearing the banks, the Company 
normally maintains a negative cash balance on its books which is reported 
as a current liability.  The amount of the negative cash balance was $14.3 
million and $12.5 million at December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.

Inventories and Supplies
Expendable and repairable aircraft parts, as well as other materials and 
supplies, are stated at average cost.  An allowance for obsolescence is 
accrued on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the 
aircraft.  Inventories related to the retired B727 fleet and other surplus 
items are carried at their net realizable value.  The allowance at December 
31, 1995 and 1996 for all inventories was $13.5 million and $16.1 million, 
respectively.

Property, Equipment and Depreciation
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the 
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which are as 
follows:
Aircraft and other
	flight equipment             	8-20 years
Buildings	                    10-30 years
Capitalized leases and 
	leasehold improvements    	Term of lease
Other equipment               	3-15 years

Assets and related obligations for items financed under capital leases are 
initially recorded at an amount equal to the present value of the future 
minimum lease payments.  The cost of major airframe overhauls, engine 
overhauls, and other modifications which extend the life or improve the 
usefulness of aircraft are capitalized and amortized over their estimated 
period of use.  Other repair and maintenance costs are expensed when 
incurred.  The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for 
impairment.

Capitalized Interest
Interest is capitalized on flight equipment purchase deposits and ground 
facilities progress payments as a cost of the related asset and is 
depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset.  Interest 
capitalization is suspended when there is a substantial delay in aircraft 
deliveries.

Intangible Assets-Subsidiaries
The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is 
recorded as an intangible asset and is amortized over 40 years.  
Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1995 and 1996 was $19.1 million 
and $21.1 million, respectively.  

Deferred Income
Deferred income results from the sale and leaseback of aircraft, the 
receipt of manufacturer or vendor credits, and from the sale of foreign tax 
benefits.  This income is recognized over the term of the applicable 
agreements.

Passenger Revenues
Passenger revenues are considered earned at the time service is provided.  
Tickets sold but not yet used are reported as air traffic liability. 

Frequent Flyer Awards
Alaska operates a frequent flyer award program that provides travel awards 
to members based on accumulated mileage.  The estimated incremental cost of 
providing free travel is recognized as an expense and accrued as a 
liability as miles are accumulated.  Alaska also defers recognition of 
income on a portion of the payments it receives from travel partners 
associated with its frequent flyer program.  The frequent flyer liability 
is relieved as travel awards are issued.

Advertising
The costs of advertising are expensed the first time the advertising takes 
place.  Advertising expense was $13.0 million, $15.2 million, and $15.6 
million, respectively, in 1994, 1995 and 1996.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 109, which requires the recognition of deferred 
tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of 
events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or 
tax returns.

Earnings Per Share
Primary earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the 
average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents 
outstanding.  Common stock equivalents result from the assumed exercise of 
stock options.  Fully diluted earnings per share gives effect to the 
conversion of convertible debt (after elimination of related interest 
expense, net of income tax effect).

Stock Options
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in 
accounting for stock options.  See Note 6 for more information.

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to hedge 
interest rate risk.  The differential to be paid or received from these 
agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognized currently 
in the income statement.  The Company enters into hedge agreements to 
reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the price of jet fuel.  A gain or 
loss is recorded quarterly if the fuel index average exceeds the ceiling 
price or falls below the floor price.

Note 2.	Marketable Securities
Marketable securities are investments that are readily convertible to cash 
and have original maturities that exceed three months.  They are classified 
as available for sale and consisted of the following at December 31 (in 
millions):
                       	1995   	1996

There were no material unrealized holding gains or losses at December 31, 
1995 or 1996.

Of the marketable securities on hand at December 31, 1996, 87% will mature 
during 1997 and the remainder will mature during 1998.  Based on specific 
identification of securities sold, the following occurred in 1995 and 1996 
(in millions): 
                     		1995    	1996
Proceeds from sales		$153.5	  $110.4
Gross realized gains		   .3      	.3

                      		 	$97.4   $86.2

Leasehold rights and deferred costs are amortized over the term of the 
related lease or contract.

Note 4.	Long-term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations
At December 31, 1995 and 1996, long-term debt and capital lease 
obligations were as follows (in millions):
                               			1995    		1996

                             			$522.4   	$404.1
 * weighted average for 1996

At December 31, 1996, borrowings of $214.1 million are secured by flight 
equipment and real property.  The 6-1/2% and 6-7/8% debentures are 
convertible into common stock at $21.50 and $33.60 per share, respectively, 
subject to adjustments in certain events.

At December 31, 1996, Alaska had a $125 million credit facility with 
commercial banks.  Advances under this facility may be for up to a maximum 
maturity of four years.  Borrowings may be used for aircraft acquisitions 
or other corporate purposes, and they bear interest at a rate which varies 
based on LIBOR.

Certain Alaska loan agreements contain provisions that require maintenance 
of specific levels of net worth, leverage and fixed charge coverage, and 
limit investments, lease obligations, sales of assets and additional 
indebtedness.  At December 31, 1996, the Company was in compliance with all 
loan provisions, and under the most restrictive loan provisions, Alaska had 
$79.2 million of net worth above the minimum.
At December 31, 1996, long-term debt principal payments for the next five 
years were (in millions):
1997		$21.9
1998		$22.9
1999		$22.8
2000		$53.9
2001		$44.2

Note 5.	Commitments
Lease Commitments
Lease contracts for 109 aircraft have remaining lease terms of one to 18 
years.  The majority of airport and terminal facilities are also leased.  
Total rent expense was $196.9 million, $201.9 million and $214.7 million, 
in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  Future minimum lease payments under 
long-term operating leases and capital leases as of December 31, 1996 are 
shown below (in millions):
				                     Operating Leases		  	Capital
		                   		Aircraft		Facilities	  Leases
1997                    		$ 169.5	  	$14.9  		$4.1
1998                       	155.2 	  	14.5			  4.1

Less amount representing interest	    						  (3.7)
Present value of capital lease payments				  $27.8

Aircraft Commitments
The Company has firm orders for 13 B737-400s to be delivered between 1997 
and 1999, two MD-83s to be delivered in 1997 and 25 Dash 8-200s to be 
delivered in 1997 and 1998.  The total amount of these commitments is 
approximately $925 million.  As of December 31, 1996, deposits related to 
the future equipment deliveries were $73.0 million.  In addition to the 
ordered aircraft, the Company holds purchase options on 12 B737-400s and 45 
Dash 8-200s.

Note 6.	Stock Plans
Air Group has three stock option plans, which provide for the purchase of 
Air Group common stock at a stipulated price on the date of grant by 
certain officers and key employees of Air Group and its subsidiaries.  
Under the 1984 Plan, options for 564,300 shares were granted.  Under the 
1988 Plan, options for 1,717,900 shares were granted.  Under the 1996 Plan, 
options for 275,100 shares have been granted and, at December 31, 1996, 
394,900 shares were available for grant.  Under all plans, the incentive 
and nonqualified stock options granted have terms of up to approximately 
ten years.  Grantees are 25% vested after one year, 50% after two years, 
75% after three years and 100% after four years.

Air Group follows APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in accounting 
for stock options.  Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized 
for these plans.  Had compensation cost for the Company's stock options 
been determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard 123, net 
income and earnings per share (EPS) would have been reduced to the pro 
forma amounts indicated below.  The reductions in future years are likely 
to be larger than shown below because options vest over four years and new 
grants are typically made each year.
                        	1995	    1996
Net income (in millions):
 As reported	          	$17.3   	$38.0
 Pro forma		             17.1    	37.4
Primary EPS:
 As reported          		$1.28   	$2.65
 Pro forma	             	1.26	    2.61
Fully diluted EPS:
 As reported		          $1.26   	$2.05
 Pro forma		             1.25    	2.03

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using 
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used 
for grants in 1995 and 1996, respectively: dividend yield of 0% and 0%; 
volatility of 37% and 36%; risk-free interest rates of 6.46% and 6.33%; and 
expected lives of 5 and 5 years.  Using these assumptions, the weighted 
average fair value of options granted was $6.69 and $9.58 in 1995 and 1996, 
respectively.

Changes in the number of shares subject to option, with their weighted 
average exercise prices, are summarized below:
                          			  Shares   	Price
Outstanding, Dec. 31, 1993		  861,362	  $17.06
Granted				                   330,200	   16.53
Exercised			               	  (58,469)	  13.65
Canceled			                  	(88,950)	  17.40
Outstanding, Dec. 31, 1994		1,044,143	  $17.15
Granted				                   425,500   	15.37
Exercised			                	(165,005)  	16.11
Canceled		                 		(143,050)  	17.80
Outstanding, Dec. 31, 1995		1,161,588	  $16.56
Granted			                   	379,900	   22.51
Exercised			                	(504,138)  	17.05
Canceled			                  	(45,525)	  17.13
Outstanding, Dec. 31, 1996	  	991,825	  $18.57

At December 31, 1996, the outstanding options had weighted average exercise 
prices ranging from $14.63 to $24.25, and a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 8.1 years.

The number of shares exercisable at year-end with their weighted average 
exercise prices, are summarized below:
                   	Shares	   Price
December 31, 1994		644,843	  $17.37
December 31, 1995		596,338   	17.24
December 31, 1996		243,675	   16.70

In addition, 1,863,593 shares of common stock are subject to 
nontransferable investment options held by management employees.  The 
Company received $2.5 million for these options, which is included with 
other accrued liabilities on the Balance Sheet.  These options are subject 
to mandatory redemption at $2.5 million in February 1997, and they allow 
the holder to purchase common stock at $27 per share until that date.

Note 7.	Employee Benefit Plans
Pension Plans
Four defined benefit and five defined contribution retirement plans cover 
various employee groups of Alaska and Horizon.  The defined benefit plans 
provide benefits based on an employee's term of service and average 
compensation for a specified period of time before retirement.  Pension 
plans are funded as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974 (ERISA).  

The defined benefit plan assets are primarily common stocks and fixed 
income securities.  Plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation 
at December 31, 1995 and 1996.  The following table sets forth the funded 
status of the plans at December 31, 1995 and 1996 (in millions):
                              			1995  		1996
Benefit obligation -
Vested                      			$155.8 	$180.9
	Nonvested	                    		22.0  		22.1
Accumulated benefit 
  obligation			                $177.8 	$203.0

 Plan assets at fair value    	$184.4 	$223.7
Projected benefit obligation  		199.9  	230.7
Plan assets less projected 
benefit obligation		           	(15.5)  	(7.0)
Unrecognized transition asset	  	(1.1)   	(.8)
Unrecognized prior service cost 		2.8		   2.6
Unrecognized loss					          	32.6  		32.6
Prepaid pension cost			       		$18.8 	$ 27.4
 
The weighted average discount rate used to determine the projected benefit 
obligation was 7.5% and 7.5% as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, 
respectively.  The calculation assumed a weighted average rate of increase 
for future compensation levels of 5.1% and 5.1% for 1995 and 1996, 
respectively.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in 
1995 and 1996 was 10%.

Net pension expense for the defined benefit plans included the following 
components for 1994, 1995 and 1996 (in millions):	

                             			1994   		1995  		1996
Service cost (benefits earned
during the period)          		$	12.4  	$	11.4 		$15.9
Interest cost on projected
benefit obligation		            11.9	   	12.9  		15.4
Actual return on  assets	      	(2.1)  	(37.0) 	(23.6)
Net amortization
	and deferral			               (10.9)   	23.3	   	6.5
Net pension expense		         $	11.3  	$	10.6   $14.2
 
The defined contribution plans are deferred compensation plans under 
section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Some of these plans require 
Company matching contributions based on a percentage of participants' 
contributions.  One plan has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) 
feature.  The ESOP owns Air Group common shares which are held in trust for 
eligible employees.  The Company has recorded deferred compensation to 
reflect the value of the shares not yet allocated to eligible employees' 
accounts.  As these shares are allocated to employees, compensation expense 
is recorded and deferred compensation is reduced.

Alaska and Horizon also maintain an unfunded, noncontributory benefit plan 
for certain elected officers.  The present value of unfunded benefits for 
this plan was accrued as of December 31, 1995 and 1996.

Total expense for all pension plans was $22.5 million, $22.2 million and 
$26.5 million,  respectively, in 1994, 1995 and 1996.

Profit Sharing Plans
Alaska and Horizon have employee profit sharing plans.  Profit sharing 
expense for 1994, 1995 and 1996 was $3.6 million, $-0- and $0.9 million, 
respectively.

Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company allows retirees to continue their medical, dental and vision 
benefits by paying the active employee plan premium until age 65.  This 
results in a subsidy to retirees because the premiums received by the 
Company are less than the actual cost of the retirees' claims.  The accrued 
postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for this subsidy at December 31, 
1995 and 1996 was $12.1 million and $13.5 million, respectively.  The APBO 
is unfunded and is included with other liabilities on the Balance Sheet.  
Annual expense related to this subsidy is not considered material to 
disclose.

Note 8.	Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the timing of 
recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting 
purposes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise the following at 
December 31 (in millions):

                              			1995   		1996
Excess of tax over book

Noncurrent deferred tax liability	41.0  		49.5
Net deferred tax liabilities		$  30.4  	$ 38.9
 
After consideration of temporary differences, taxable income for 1996 was 
approximately $63 million, which was offset by net operating losses 
generated in prior years.  Federal loss carryforwards can be used through 
year 2008.

The components of income tax expense were as follows (in millions):
	                    	1994   	1995  	  1996
Current tax expense:
	Federal	            $ 8.0  	$ 5.0  	$ 17.5

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alaska Air Group, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Alaska Air 
Group, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 
1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of income, 
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 1996.  These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, 
in all material respects, the financial position of Alaska Air Group, Inc. 
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic 
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in Item 14(a) 
is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic financial 
statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures 
applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and, in our 
opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic 
financial statements taken as a whole.
