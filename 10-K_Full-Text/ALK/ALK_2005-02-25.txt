PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL INFORMATION

Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group or the Company) is a holding
company that was incorporated in Delaware in 1985. Our two
principal subsidiaries are Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and
Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Both subsidiaries
operate as airlines, although their business plans, competition,
and economic risks differ substantially. Alaska is a major
airline, operates an all-jet fleet, and its average passenger
trip length is 996 miles. Horizon is a regional airline,
operates jet and turboprop aircraft, and its average passenger
trip is 363 miles. Individual financial information for
Alaska and Horizon is reported in Note 12 to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Air Group’s executive offices are located at 19300
International Boulevard, Seattle, Washington, 98188. Air
Group’s filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including its annual report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on
Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are accessible
free of charge at

www.alaskaair.com

. The information
contained on our website is not a part of this annual report on
Form 10-K. As used in this Form 10-K, the terms
“Air Group,” “our,” “we” and the
“Company” refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its
subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.

Alaska

Alaska Airlines, Inc. is an Alaska corporation that was
organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937. Alaska principally
serves 39 cities in six western states (Alaska, Washington,
Oregon, California, Nevada, and Arizona) and Canada and nine
cities in Mexico. Alaska also provides non-stop service between
Seattle and five eastern cities (Washington, D.C., Boston,
Miami, Orlando, and Newark), between Seattle and Denver, Seattle
and Chicago, between Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and
between Anchorage and Chicago. In each year since 1973, Alaska
has carried more passengers between Alaska and the
U.S. mainland than any other airline. In 2004, Alaska
carried 16.3 million revenue passengers. Passenger traffic
within Alaska and between Alaska and the U.S. mainland
accounted for 20% of Alaska’s 2004 revenue passenger miles,
West Coast traffic (including Canada) accounted for 53%, the
Mexico markets accounted for 10% and other markets accounted for
17%. Based on passenger enplanements, Alaska’s leading
airports are Seattle, Los Angeles, Portland and Anchorage. Based
on 2004 revenues, its leading nonstop routes are
Seattle-Anchorage, Seattle-Los Angeles, and
Seattle-San Diego. At December 31, 2004, Alaska’s
operating fleet consisted of 108 jet aircraft.

Horizon

Horizon Air Industries, Inc., a Washington corporation that
first began service in 1981, was incorporated in 1982 and was
acquired by Air Group in 1986. It is the largest regional
airline in the Pacific Northwest, and serves 40 cities in
six states (Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, California and
Colorado) and six cities in Canada. In 2004, Horizon carried
5.9 million revenue passengers. Based on passenger
enplanements, Horizon’s leading airports are Seattle,
Portland, Spokane, and Boise. Based on revenues in 2004, its
leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Portland, Seattle-Spokane,
Seattle-Vancouver and Seattle-Calgary. At December 31,
2004, Horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 18 jets and 47
turboprop aircraft, with the jets providing 35% of the 2004
capacity. Except for those flights operating as Frontier
JetExpress, Horizon flights are listed under the Alaska Airlines
designator code in airline reservation systems.

On January 1, 2004, Horizon began operating regional jet
service branded as Frontier JetExpress under a 12-year agreement
with Frontier Airlines. Service under this agreement became
fully operational during the second quarter of 2004 and Horizon
is currently operating nine regional jet aircraft under the
Frontier JetExpress brand. Flying under this agreement
represented 21.4% of Horizon’s 2004 capacity and 9.1% of
passenger revenues. For the fourth quarter (which is
representative of ongoing operations), flying under this
agreement represented 23.1% of Horizon’s fourth quarter
capacity and 9.9% of passenger revenue.



The arrangement with Frontier provides for reimbursement of
costs plus a base mark-up and certain incentives. However, since
Horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of
operations such as fuel, landing fees, marketing costs and
station labor and rents and combined with longer trip lengths,
revenue per ASM, cost per ASM and cost per ASM excluding fuel
for this flying is significantly lower than Horizon’s
native network flying.

Alaska and Horizon coordinate their flight schedules to provide
service between any two points served by their systems. In 2004,
28% of Horizon’s passengers connected to flights operated
by Alaska compared to 31% in 2003. We believe both airlines
distinguish themselves from competitors by providing a higher
level of customer service in the form of attention to customer
needs, advance seat assignments, expedited check-in,
well-maintained aircraft, a first-class section aboard Alaska
aircraft, a generous frequent flyer program and other amenities.

Industry Conditions

The airline industry is highly competitive. Airline results are
sensitive to passenger demand, ticket prices, labor costs and
fuel costs. Passenger demand and ticket prices are, to a large
measure, influenced by the general state of the economy, current
events and industry capacity. Our industry was negatively
impacted by weak economic conditions during 2001, 2002 and the
first half of 2003, the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks and continued hostilities in the Middle East. Economic
conditions in the second half of 2003 and through 2004 improved
somewhat, resulting in stronger demand and higher traffic
levels. Due to the industry’s high fixed costs in relation
to revenue, a small change in load factors or fare levels has a
large impact on profits.

Labor costs generally make up 30% to 40% of an airlines’
total operating costs. Most major airlines, including ours, have
employee groups who are represented by collective bargaining
agents. Often, airlines with unionized work forces have higher
labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces, and may
not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward fast enough
to respond to new competition. Our wage and benefit costs
increased 3% in 2004, 9% in 2003 and 8% in 2002.

Fuel prices generally make up 15% to 25% of an airline’s
operating costs. Fuel prices can be volatile and largely
uncontrollable. In 2004, fuel prices increased significantly.
Our economic fuel cost per gallon (which is the net price we pay
after the benefit of fuel hedges) increased 39% and 14% in 2004
and 2003, respectively, and decreased 10% in 2002.

The industry is currently in a state of flux. So called
“Low Cost Carriers” (LCCs) have grown rapidly in
recent years and currently enjoy a 30% share of total passengers
carried in the United States. Because of their cost advantage,
LCCs have contributed to an overall decline in ticket yields.
The lower yield environment, coupled with high fuel costs, has
been problematic for the higher cost “Legacy
Carriers”, a number of which are operating under bankruptcy
court protection. Because of the relatively low barriers to
entry, we expect the expansion of low cost and low fare carriers
to continue. Some legacy carriers, such as Delta and United,
have launched their own low fare airlines (Song and Ted). We
compete with many of these carriers now, and expect to compete
with additional entrants in the future.

Most major US carriers, including Alaska, are working
aggressively to cut operating costs, including renegotiation of
collective bargaining agreements and vendor agreements.

As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial
statements, in April 2003, the Emergency Wartime Supplemental
Appropriations Act (the Act) was signed into legislation. The
Act includes $2.3 billion of one-time cash payments to air
carriers, allocated based on each carrier’s share of
security fees remitted and carrier fees paid to the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) since its
inception in February 2002. Additionally, passenger security
fees were not imposed by the TSA and carrier fees were not paid
during the period June 1, 2003 through September 30,
2003. In May 2003, we received our share of the one-time cash
grant in the amount of $71.4 million ($52.8 million
for Alaska and $18.6 million for Horizon).



MARKETING AND COMPETITION

Alliances with Other Airlines

Alaska and Horizon have marketing alliances with other airlines
that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage accrual and
redemption privileges and code sharing on certain flights as set
forth below. Alliances enhance Alaska’s and Horizon’s
revenues by offering our customers more travel destinations and
better mileage accrual/redemption opportunities by gaining us
access to more connecting traffic from other airlines, and by
providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer
programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska and Horizon while
earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs. Our
marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any
time, one or more may be in the process of renegotiation. If a
significant agreement were terminated, it could adversely impact
revenues and increase the costs of our other marketing
agreements. Most of our code share relationships are free-sell
code shares, where the marketing carrier sells seats on the
operating carrier’s flights from the operating
carrier’s inventory, but takes no inventory risk. The table
below identifies our marketing alliances with other airlines as
of December 31, 2004.

This airline does not have its own frequent flyer program.
    However, Alaska’s Mileage Plan members can accrue and
    redeem miles on this airline’s route system.

**

Capacity purchase arrangement as described under
    “Business — General Information —

Competition

Competition in the airline industry is intense. We believe the
principal competitive factors in the industry that are important
to customers are:



Any domestic air carrier issued a certificate of public
convenience and necessity by the Department of Transportation is
allowed to operate scheduled passenger service in the United
States. Together, Alaska and Horizon carry approximately 3.2% of
all U.S. domestic passenger traffic. Alaska and Horizon
compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of
their routes, including Southwest Airlines, United Airlines,
Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines, American Airlines,
Delta Airlines and regional affiliates associated with some of
these carriers. Many of our competitors are substantially larger
than Alaska and Horizon, have greater financial resources, and
have more extensive route systems. In addition, continuing
growth of low-cost carriers, including Southwest Airlines,
AirTran Airways, American Trans Air, Frontier Airlines and
jetBlue Airways in the United States places significant
competitive pressures on us and other network carriers since
they have the ability to charge a lower fare for travel between
similar cities and thus exert downward pressure on yields. Due
to its short haul markets, Horizon also competes with ground
transportation, including train, bus and automobile
transportation.

We also compete with other airlines for skilled employees such
as pilots, flight attendants, ramp service employees, customer
service agents and aircraft mechanics.

Ticket Distribution

Airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels:

•

Airline websites such as alaskaair.com or horizonair.com. It is
    less expensive for us to sell through these direct channels and,
    as a result, we continue to invest heavily in its online
    capabilities.

•

Telephone reservation call centers.

•

Traditional and online travel agents. Consumer reliance on
    traditional travel agencies is shrinking, while usage of online
    travel agencies is increasing. Both traditional and online
    travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems (GDS),
    such as Sabre, to obtain their fare and inventory data from
    airlines. Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee,
    the “GDS fee”, that is charged to the airline.

We currently participate in all of these distribution channels,
but we cannot predict the terms on which we may be able to
continue to participate in these or other sites, or their effect
on our ability to compete with other airlines.

EMPLOYEES

The airline business is labor intensive. Alaska and Horizon had
10,850 and 3,734, respectively, active full-time and part-time
employees at December 31, 2004. Wages, salaries and
benefits represented approximately 35% of our total operating
expenses in 2004.

At December 31, 2004, labor unions represented 83% of
Alaska’s and 45% of Horizon’s employees. Our relations
with our labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor
Act. Under this act, the collective bargaining agreements
between the respective airlines and these organizations do not
expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If
either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement,
it must notify the other party in the manner described in the
agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet
for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either
party may request the National Mediation Board to appoint a
federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the
National



Mediation Board may declare that an impasse exists, at which
point the National Mediation Board proffers binding arbitration
to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to
arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a
30-day “cooling off” period commences. During that
period, a Presidential Emergency Board may be established, which
examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution.
The Presidential Emergency Board process lasts for 30 days
and is followed by a “cooling off” period of
30 days. At the end of a “cooling off” period,
unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress,
the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to
“self-help”, including the imposition of any or all of
its proposed amendments and the hiring of workers to replace
strikers.

Two of Alaska’s collective bargaining agreements contain
provisions for interest arbitration. Under interest arbitration,
if the parties have not negotiated the contract by a
predetermined date, each side may submit a prescribed number of
issues to binding arbitration. The arbitrator’s decision on
those issues is incorporated into the collective bargaining
agreement, and no strike or company “self-help” may
occur.

The collective bargaining agreement with the dispatchers is open
for negotiation on wage rates in March 2005. If the parties are
unable to reach an agreement, there is an interest arbitration
provision related only to wages.

The pilot contract provides that, if an agreement on the entire
contract was not reached by December 15, 2004, ten contract
issues plus wage rates would be submitted to an interest
arbitrator. Issues submitted generally relate to pension plans,
medical insurance, profit sharing, code sharing and work rules.
The parties did not reach an agreement, and the issues have been
submitted to binding arbitration in March 2005 with a decision
to be effective in May 2005. The pilot labor contract contains
market related standards for wages and non-wage issues.

Alaska’s union contracts at December 31, 2004 were as

REGULATION

General

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as amended, eliminated
most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight
transportation. However, the Department of Transportation and
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) still exercise
regulatory authority over air carriers. In order to provide
passenger and cargo air transportation in the U.S., a domestic
airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience
and necessity issued by the Department of Transportation.
Subject to certain individual airport capacity, noise and other
restrictions, this certificate permits an air carrier to operate
between any two points in the U.S. A certificate is of
unlimited duration, but may be revoked for failure to comply
with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders or the terms
of the certificate itself. In addition, the Department of
Transportation maintains jurisdiction over the approval of
international code share agreements, alliance agreements between
domestic major airlines, international route authorities and
certain consumer protection matters, such as advertising, denied
boarding compensation and baggage liability.

The FAA regulates aircraft operations generally, including
establishing personnel, maintenance and flight operation
standards. Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air
carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA. Pursuant to
these regulations, we have established, and the FAA has
approved, a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we
operate that provides for the ongoing maintenance of such
aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major
overhauls. From time to time the FAA issues airworthiness
directives (ADs) that must be incorporated into our aircraft. We
are and expect to be in compliance with all applicable
requirements of these ADs within the required time periods.

The Department of Justice has jurisdiction over airline
antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction
over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related
services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are
regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the
National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with
respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating
to union representation and collective bargaining agreements. To
the extent we continue to pursue alliances with international
carriers, we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign
agencies.

In November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act
(the Security Act) was enacted. The Security Act created a new
government agency, the Transportation Security Administration
(TSA), which is now part of the Department of Homeland Security
and is responsible for aviation security. The Security Act
mandates that the TSA shall provide for the screening of all
passengers and property, including U.S. mail, cargo,
carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that will be
carried aboard a passenger aircraft. The TSA performs these
functions with its own federal employees. On December 31,
2002, the TSA began explosive detection screening of all checked
baggage

.

The TSA also provides for increased security on
flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be
present on certain flights.

Effective February 1, 2002, the Security Act imposed a
$2.50 per enplanement security service fee (maximum $5.00
one-way fee) which is collected by the air carriers and
submitted to the government to pay



for these enhanced security measures. In addition, carriers are
required to pay an additional amount to the TSA to cover the
total cost of providing security measures equal to the amount
the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in
2000. We paid $12.6 million, $8.4 million and
$9.9 million to the TSA for this security charge in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Recently, the United States Department of Homeland Security
proposed raising the aviation security fee from $2.50 per
one-way segment to $5.50 per one-way segment (or maximum of
$8 for a one way trip with multiple segments). Although fees and
taxes are often viewed by lawmakers as pass through costs, we
believe that the demand for air travel is highly sensitive to
price. Since all such increases affect the total ticket price
paid by consumers, we believe that they would reduce passenger
traffic and could have a negative impact on our results.

The Department of Transportation, under its authority to prevent
unfair competitive practices in the industry, has from time to
time considered the issuance of pricing and capacity rules that
would limit major air carriers’ competitive response to new
entrant carriers. Although the Department of Transportation has
thus far declined to issue specific competitive guidelines, it
reiterated its intent to prevent what it considers to be unfair
competitive practices in the industry, and to pursue enforcement
actions on a case-by-case basis. To the extent that future
Department of Transportation enforcement actions either directly
or indirectly impose restrictions upon our ability to respond to
competitors, our business may be adversely impacted. Conversely,
a relaxation in either unfair competition enforcement or
restrictions could limit our ability to enter new markets or
harm our operating results for markets that we have recently
entered.

Airline Fares

Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares
without governmental regulation, and the industry is
characterized by vigorous price competition. The Department of
Transportation maintains authority over international (generally
outside of North America) fares, rates and charges.
International fares and rates are also subject to the
jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we
serve. While air carriers are required to file and adhere to
international fare and rate tariffs, substantial commissions,
overrides and discounts to travel agents, brokers and
wholesalers characterize many international markets.

Legislation, sometimes referred to as the “Passengers’
Bill of Rights,” has been discussed in Congress and state
legislatures. This legislation could, if enacted, place various
limitations on airline fares and/or affect operating practices
such as baggage handling and overbooking. In 1999, we, as well
as other domestic airlines, implemented a Customer Service Plan
to address a number of service goals, including, but not limited
to goals relating to lowest fare availability, delays,
cancellations and diversions, baggage delivery and liability,
guaranteed fares and ticket refunds.

To the extent legislation is enacted that would inhibit our
flexibility with respect to fares, our revenue management
system, our operations or other aspects of our customer service
operations, our financial results could be adversely affected.

Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative
effect on our financial results because we generally match
competitors’ fares to maintain passenger traffic. During
recent years, a number of new low-cost airlines have entered the
domestic market and several major airlines, including Alaska and
Horizon, implemented efforts to lower their cost structures.
Further fare reductions, domestic and international, may occur
in the future. If fare reductions are not offset by increases in
passenger traffic, cost reductions or changes in the mix of
traffic that improves yields, our operating results will be
negatively impacted.

In February 2004, Alaska initiated a fare simplification plan
whereby a number of restrictions were eliminated and the gap
between the highest and lowest fares was reduced. The goal of
this initiative was to increase customer value and simplify the
customer’s purchase decision by reducing the number of
fares sold. We believe this initiative was revenue neutral
overall.



Airport Access

Heavily used airports may have restrictions with respect to the
number of permitted take-offs and landings, the total permitted
annual seat capacity to be operated at an airport, the use or
allocation of airport slots, or other restrictions. We currently
have sufficient authorizations to operate our existing flights
and have generally been able to obtain gates to expand our
operations and change our schedules. However, we cannot assure
you that we will be able to obtain authorizations for these
purposes in the future, or be able to do so on economical terms.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various laws and government regulations
concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health
in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that
have a particular impact on us include the Airport Noise and
Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe
Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or Superfund Act. We
are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, known as OSHA, concerning employee safety
and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, or EPA, OSHA, and other federal agencies have been
authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our
operations. In addition to these federal activities, various
states have been delegated certain authorities under the
aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local
governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and
health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to
federal requirements. We maintain our own continuing safety,
health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed
these requirements.

The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of
airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise
abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably
with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air
transportation system. Authorities in several cities have
promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs, including the
imposition of nighttime curfews. The Airport Noise and Capacity
Act generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions
on aircraft. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility
to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, our
operations could be adversely affected if such regulations
become more restrictive or widespread.

Although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory
matters, individually or collectively, will have a material
impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows, we cannot assure you that new regulations or compliance
issues that we do not currently anticipate will not harm our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in
future periods.

FUEL

Our operations are significantly affected by the availability
and price of jet fuel. Fuel costs were approximately 19% of our
total operating expenses in 2004 and 15% in 2003. Fuel prices,
which can be volatile and which are outside of our control, can
have a significant impact on our operating results. Currently, a
one-cent change in the fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel
costs by approximately $4.0 million. We believe that
operating fuel-efficient aircraft helps to mitigate the effect
of high fuel prices.

We purchase fuel hedge contracts to reduce our exposure to
fluctuations in the price of jet fuel. Due to the competitive
nature of the airline industry, airlines often are unable to
pass on increased fuel prices to customers by increasing fares.
Conversely, any potential benefit of lower fuel prices may be
offset by increased fare competition and lower revenues. Because
of rising fuel prices, our fuel hedging program has resulted in
significant savings over the last three years. See Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” for a discussion of
our fuel hedging activities.

While we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in
fuel availability, dependency on foreign imports of crude oil
and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel
production, transportation and marketing make it impossible to
predict the future availability of jet fuel. In the event of
significant hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing
areas, there could be reductions in the production and/or



importation of crude oil and price increases, which could
adversely affect our business. If there were major reductions in
the availability of jet fuel, our business would be adversely
affected.

FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM

All major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a
way of increasing passenger loyalty. Alaska’s Mileage Plan
allows members to earn mileage by flying on Alaska, Horizon and
other participating airlines, and by using the services of
non-airline partners, which include a credit card partner,
telephone companies, hotels, and car rental agencies. Alaska is
paid by non-airline partners for the miles it credits to member
accounts. With advance notice, Alaska has the ability to change
the Mileage Plan terms, conditions, partners, mileage credits,
and award levels or terminate the program.

Mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for
other travel industry awards. Upon accumulating the necessary
mileage, members notify Alaska of their award selection. Over
75% of the free flight awards on Alaska and Horizon are subject
to blackout dates and capacity-controlled seating. Mileage Plan
accounts are generally deleted after three years of inactivity
in that member’s account. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, Alaska estimated that 2,493,000 and 2,353,000,
respectively, round-trip flight awards were eligible for
redemption by Mileage Plan members who have mileage credits
exceeding the 20,000-mile free round-trip domestic ticket award
threshold. Of those eligible awards, Alaska estimated that
approximately 88% of those awards would ultimately be redeemed.
For the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 631,000,
606,000, and 441,000 round-trip flight awards were redeemed and
flown on Alaska and Horizon. Those awards represent
approximately 7.3% for 2004, 8.7% for 2003 and 6.8% for 2002 of
the total passenger miles flown on Alaska and Horizon for each
period. For the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately
212,000, 174,000 and 174,000, respectively, round-trip flight
awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners.

For miles earned by flying on Alaska and travel partners, the
estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is
recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as
miles are accumulated. The incremental cost does not include a
contribution to overhead, aircraft cost, or profit. Alaska also
sells mileage credits to non-airline partners, such as hotels,
car rental agencies, and a national bank that rewards users of
its credit card. Alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds,
and recognizes these proceeds as revenue when the award
transportation is provided on Alaska or another partner airline.
The deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for
awards issued and flown on Alaska or Horizon and as other
revenue-net for awards issued and flown on other airlines. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the deferred revenue and the
total liability for providing free travel on Alaska and Horizon
and for estimated payments to partner airlines was
$409.3 million and $336.0 million, respectively, the
majority of which is deferred revenue from the sale of mileage
credits.

OTHER INFORMATION

Seasonality and Other Factors

Our results of operations for any interim period are not
necessarily indicative of those for the entire year, because our
business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our operating
income is generally lowest (or loss the greatest) during the
first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic and
sometimes due to adverse weather conditions, generally increases
in the second quarter and generally reaches its highest level
during the third quarter.

The airline industry is characterized generally by low profit
margins and high fixed costs, primarily for wages, aircraft
fuel, debt service and rent. The expenses of an aircraft flight
do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried
and, as a result, a relatively small change in the number of
passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an
airline’s operating and financial results. Accordingly, a
minor



shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a
disproportionately negative impact on our operating results. In
addition to passenger loads, factors that could cause our
quarterly operating results to vary include:

In addition, seasonal variations in traffic, various
expenditures and weather affect our operating results from
quarter to quarter. Given our high proportion of fixed costs,
seasonality can affect our profitability from quarter to
quarter. Many of our areas of operations experience inclement
weather conditions in the winter, causing increased costs
associated with deicing aircraft, canceled flights and
accommodating displaced passengers. Due to our geographic area
of operations, we can be more susceptible to adverse weather
conditions than some of our competitors (particularly in the
State of Alaska and in the Pacific Northwest), who may be better
able to spread weather-related risks over larger route systems.

The results of operations in the air transportation business
have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to
general economic conditions. Fare initiatives, fluctuations in
fuel prices, labor actions and other factors could impact this
seasonal pattern.

No material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is
dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.
Consequently, the loss of our largest few customers would not
have a materially adverse effect upon our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

Insurance

We carry insurance for passenger liability, property damage and
hull insurance for damage to our aircraft, in amounts and of the
type generally consistent with industry practice.

As a result of the events of September 11, 2001, aviation
insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of
insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for
third-party liability for claims resulting from acts of
terrorism, war or similar events. At the same time, they
significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well
as for aviation insurance in general. Although insurance rates
have declined, they are still somewhat above pre-September 11
levels and will likely remain there for the foreseeable future.

Pursuant to authority granted in the Air Transportation Safety
and System Stabilization Act, the Homeland Security Act of 2002,
as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, the
Government has offered, and we have accepted, war risk insurance
to replace commercial war risk insurance through August 31,
2005.

Other Government Matters

We have elected to participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
program, whereby we have agreed to make available to the federal
government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a
military call-up. The government would reimburse us for the use
of such aircraft.

PROPERTIES

Aircraft

The following tables describe the aircraft we operate and their
average age at December 31, 2004:

Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” discusses future orders and options for
additional aircraft.

32 of the 60 aircraft owned by Alaska as of December 31,
2004 are subject to liens securing long-term debt. The Company
expects to have additional aircraft encumbered pending a
re-negotiated credit facility. Alaska’s leased 737-200C,
737-400, 737-700 and MD-80 aircraft have lease expiration dates
in 2006, between 2006 and 2016, between 2006 and 2020 and
between 2007 and 2013, respectively. Horizon’s leased Q400
and CRJ 700 aircraft have expiration dates between 2005 and 2018
and between 2018 and 2020, respectively. Alaska and Horizon have
the option to extend most of the leases for additional periods,
or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease
term, usually at the then fair market value of the aircraft. For
information regarding obligations under capital leases and
long-term operating leases, see Note 5 to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2004, all of our aircraft met the
Stage 3 noise requirements under the Airport Noise and
Capacity Act of 1990. However, special noise ordinances restrict
the timing of flights operated by Alaska and other airlines at
Burbank, Long Beach, Orange County, San Diego,
San Jose and Palm Springs. In addition, Orange County,
Reagan National, O’Hare and Long Beach airports restrict
the type of aircraft and number of flights.

Ground Facilities and Services

Alaska and Horizon lease ticket counters, gates, cargo and
baggage space, office space, and other support areas at the
majority of the airports they serve. Alaska also owns terminal
buildings in various cities in the state of Alaska.

Alaska has centralized operations in several buildings located
at or near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) in
Seattle, Washington. The owned buildings, including land unless
located on leased airport property, include a three-bay hangar
facility with maintenance shops, a flight operations and
training center, an air cargo facility, an information
processing center, several office buildings and our corporate
headquarters. Alaska also leases a two-bay hangar/office
facility at Sea-Tac, a warehouse and reservation/office facility
in Kent, WA, and a reservation center in Boise, ID.
Alaska’s other major facilities include a regional
headquarters building, an air cargo facility, and a leased
hangar/office facility in Anchorage; a reservations center in
Phoenix; and a leased two-bay maintenance facility in Oakland.



Horizon owns its Seattle corporate headquarters building. It
leases an operations, training, and aircraft maintenance
facility in Portland, and maintenance facilities in Boise,
Pasco, Seattle and Spokane.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business
and with respect to which no material liability is expected.
Management believes the ultimate disposition of these matters is
not likely to materially affect our financial position or
results of operations. This forward-looking statement is based
on management’s current understanding of the relevant law
and facts; it is subject to various contingencies, including the
potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the
actions of judges and juries.

Our existing pilot contract provides that, if a negotiated
agreement on the entire contract was not reached by
December 15, 2004, ten contract issues plus wage rates
would be submitted to an interest arbitrator. Issues submitted
generally relate to pension plans, medical insurance, profit
sharing, code sharing and work rules. The parties did not reach
an agreement, and the issues have been submitted to binding
arbitration in March 2005 with a decision to be effective in May
2005. The pilot labor contract contains market related standards
for wages and non-wage issues.

The shares to be issued under plans not approved by stockholders
relate to the Company’s 1997 Long-Term Incentive Equity
Plan. This plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in 1997
and did not require stockholder approval because no grants to
executive officers were allowed under the plan.

1997 Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan (the “1997
    Plan”)

The 1997 Plan terminated on November 3, 2002 and no further
awards may be made. Awards granted before that date remain
outstanding in accordance with their terms. Under the 1997 Plan,
awards could be made to any employee of the Company who was not
a director or officer subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Awards could be made in the form of stock options,
Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) or stock awards. The 1997 Plan
is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors.

2004 Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan (the “2004
    Plan”)

The 2004 Plan became effective on May 18, 2004 and shall
terminate on May 18, 2014 unless otherwise terminated
earlier by the Board. Under the 2004 Plan, awards can be made to
any board director, executive officer or employee of the
Company. Awards can be made in the form of stock options, SARs
or stock awards. The Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors administers the 2004 Plan.

In addition, the 2004 Plan authorizes the granting of shares to
board members according to the terms of the Nonemployee Director
Stock Plan, as described below.

Nonemployee Director Stock Plan (the “Directors’
    Plan”)

An aggregate of up to 25,000 shares of common stock was
authorized for issuance under the Directors’ Plan. It
remains in effect until all shares have been purchased or
acquired or until terminated by the Board.

Each member of the Board of Directors of the Company who is not
employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries is an
eligible director. Each year on the first business day following
that year’s annual meeting of stockholders, a portion of an
eligible director’s annual retainer for services as a
director for the coming year is paid in shares of common stock
having a total value of $5,000.

In addition, each eligible director may elect to reduce his or
her annual cash retainer and to receive instead a number of
shares of common stock equal in value to the amount of the
reduction on the same date the stock payment described above is
made.

Directors have the right to vote and receive dividends on shares
that have been issued under the Directors’ Plan. The shares
are not forfeited when participants leave the Board or otherwise
become ineligible to continue in the Directors’ Plan.

financial measures to their most directly of aircraft fuel are
subject to many economic and political factors beyond our
control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge
portfolio comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP
basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the
ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without
the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses
associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate),
restructuring charges, aircraft impairment charges, government
compensation in 2003 and a large recovery in 2004 of disputed
navigation fees paid in prior years (of which $7.7 million
was recorded in operating expenses and $3.3 million was
recorded in non-operating income). Because the cost and
availability in our income statement, it is our view that the
measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is
important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial
performance without impairment and restructuring charges,
government compensation and the navigation fee recovery in 2004
is useful to investors.

Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more
comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of
Transportation by other major network airlines.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All statements in the
following discussion which are not reports of historical
information or descriptions of current accounting policies are
forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking
statements in light of the risks referred to in this
report’s introductory cautionary note. There can be no
assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by
us. Actual results could differ materially from those projected
as a result of a number of factors, some of which we cannot
predict or control. For a discussion of our risk factors, see
“Risk Factors,” beginning on page 41.

General

Alaska and Horizon operate as airlines. However, their business
plans, competition, and economic risks differ substantially.
Alaska is a major airline serving primarily Alaska; the
U.S. West Coast; five cities on the U.S. East Coast,
Denver, Chicago; Vancouver and Calgary, Canada; and Mexico. It
operates an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is
996 miles. Horizon operates both as a regional airline
serving primarily the Pacific Northwest, California, and Western
Canada, and as a contract service provider to Frontier Airlines,
operating as Frontier JetExpress out of Denver. Horizon operates
both jet and turboprop aircraft, and its average passenger trip
is 363 miles. As discussed in Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning in 2004, Horizon
began operating regional jet service branded as Frontier
JetExpress under an agreement with Frontier Airlines, which is
described in more detail below.

Year in Review and Current Events

Overall, economic conditions in 2004 improved over 2003. The
industry generally enjoyed increases in both passenger traffic
and load factors, and Alaska and Horizon were no
different — posting record monthly load factors for
much of the year. However, ticket yields continued to remain
under pressure in the wake of growth of low cost carriers such
as Southwest and jetBlue and excess capacity in many markets.
Fuel prices reached record highs during much of the year,
although moderated somewhat in the fourth quarter, but are still
materially above historical averages. These factors, coupled
with the high cost structures of many major carriers, resulted
in another year of significant losses for the industry.

During 2004, the management team at Alaska was actively focused
on cost reductions. Our stated goal for 2004 was to achieve a
unit cost (excluding fuel and significant items) of 8.0 cents
per available seat mile (ASM) and we achieved a full year
unit cost excluding fuel and significant items of 7.92 cents per
ASM.

Restructuring Charges

During the third quarter of 2004, Alaska announced a management
reorganization and the closure of its Oakland heavy maintenance
base, contracting out of related heavy maintenance, contracting
out of the Company’s Fleet Service, Ground Support
Equipment and facility maintenance functions, maintenance shops
and other initiatives. In total, we believe these restructuring
activities will result in a reduction of approximately 900
employees when fully implemented in the first half of 2005.
Severance and related costs associated with this restructuring
are estimated at $53.4 million, of which $27.5 million
was recorded during the third quarter of 2004 and
$25.9 million was recorded in the fourth quarter. We expect
savings from these job-related initiatives to be approximately
$35 million per year when fully implemented.

As part of our ongoing cost saving initiatives, we continue to
look at all aspects of our business. In 2005, we may outsource
other activities or initiate other restructuring activities
which would result in further restructuring charges.

Labor Costs and Negotiations

Alaska Airlines continues to pursue the restructuring of its
labor agreements so that they are in line with what we believe
to be the market. Our objectives as we restructure these
agreements are to achieve market



labor costs, productivity and employee benefit costs. Based on
these three objectives, in 2003 Alaska targeted
$112 million per year of labor savings. As a result of
increases in our wage rates since that time, combined with labor
cost decreases achieved by our competitors, we believe that our
wages and benefits are now above market by approximately
$125 million. Alaska believes that its pilot labor costs
represent the majority of this amount. Despite ongoing
negotiations in late 2003 and much of 2004, we were unable to
reach a new agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association
(ALPA) and have therefore submitted to binding arbitration,
the decision of which will be effective in May 2005. The
arbitration will cover wages plus five issues submitted by each
of the Company and ALPA. The pilot labor contract contains
market related standards for wages and benefits. Nevertheless,
we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding, particularly
whether the arbitrator’s award will reflect cost savings in
wage rates, productivity and benefits equal to what we consider
to be the current excess over market.

Reducing labor costs and finalizing the agreements with our
labor groups is an important objective for 2005.

Mark-to-Market Fuel Hedging Gains

Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, we lost the ability to
defer, as a component of comprehensive income, recognition of
any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until
the hedged fuel is consumed. We lost this ability because the
price correlation between crude oil, the commodity we use to
hedge, and West Coast jet fuel fell below required thresholds.
For more discussion, see Note 10 to our consolidated
financial statements.

The implications of this change are twofold: First, our earnings
are more volatile as we mark our entire hedge portfolio to
market each quarter-end and report the gain or loss in other
non-operating income or expense, even though the actual
consumption will take place in a future period. Second, to a
large extent, the impact of our fuel hedge program will not be
reflected in fuel expense. For example, we recorded gains from
settled fuel hedges totaling $45.2 million during 2004, but
only $16.6 million of that gain is reflected as an offset
to fuel expense with the balance reported in other non-operating
income.

We have provided information on mark-to-market gains or losses,
as well as calculations of our economic fuel cost per gallon on
pages 20 through 22.

We continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an
important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to
volatile fuel prices.

Impairment of 737-200C Aircraft

In June 2004, the Company’s Board approved a plan to
accelerate the retirement of its Boeing 737-200C fleet and
remove those aircraft from service earlier than initially
planned. In July 2004, the Company announced its plan to replace
these aircraft by modifying five existing 737-400 aircraft and
using other existing 737-400 aircraft for the remaining
passenger capacity. At December 31, 2004 the planned
modifications have been delayed. However, management currently
believes that all 737-200s will still be retired by the end of
2007 as planned. The Company expects to replace the 737-400s
with Boeing 737-800 aircraft in 2005 and 2006.

As a result of this decision, the Company evaluated impairment
as required by SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” and concluded
that the carrying value of the 737-200C fleet was no longer
recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash
flows. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2004, the
Company recorded an impairment charge totaling
$36.8 million (pre-tax) to write down the fleet to its
estimated fair market value. In addition, we revised our
estimates of the useful lives and residual values of the fleet
and related spare equipment and will depreciate the remaining
carrying values through 2007, when the last aircraft will be
retired.



Navigation Fee Refund

During the third quarter of 2004, we received a refund totaling
$11 million (pre-tax) from the Mexican government related
to navigation fees paid in 2002 and 2003. Approximately
$7.7 million of the refund was recorded as a reduction to
operating expenses and $3.3 million was recorded as
non-operating income.

Frontier JetExpress

On January 1, 2004, Horizon began operating regional jet
service branded as Frontier JetExpress under a 12-year agreement
with Frontier Airlines. Service under this agreement became
fully operational during the second quarter of 2004 and Horizon
is currently operating nine regional jet aircraft under the
Frontier JetExpress brand. Flying under this agreement
represented 21.4% of Horizon’s 2004 capacity and 9.1% of
passenger revenues. For the fourth quarter (which is more
representative of ongoing operations), flying under this
agreement represented 23.1% of Horizon’s fourth quarter
capacity and 9.9% of passenger revenue.

The arrangement with Frontier provides for reimbursement of
costs plus a base mark-up and certain incentives. However, since
Horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of
operations such as fuel, landing fees, marketing costs and
station labor and rents and combined with longer trip lengths,
revenue per ASM, cost per ASM and cost per ASM excluding fuel
for this flying is significantly lower than Horizon’s
native network flying.

Other Events

During the fourth quarter of 2004, Alaska entered into a
10 year “power-by-the-hour” engine maintenance
agreement with a third party. Under terms of this arrangement,
the third party will provide routine and major overhaul
maintenance services on certain engines in our 737-400 fleet at
an agreed upon rate per hour flown.

During the fourth quarter, Alaska added a row of seats to its
737-400 fleet. This change will result in an increase of
approximately 2.3% in available seat miles on an annualized
basis. We expect this change will represent a significant
portion of our capacity growth in 2005. In late 2004, we also
announced that we would be installing winglets on our B737-700
aircraft.

Outlook

For 2005, Alaska and Horizon expect capacity increases of
approximately 3% and 12%, respectively. The expected capacity
increase at Alaska is due largely to the annualization of the
additional seats added to the B737-400 fleet and the addition of
three B737-800s offset by the retirement of two B737-200s.

Horizon’s expected capacity increase is due largely to the
annualization of aircraft additions in the first half of 2004,
the addition of one new CRJ-700, higher utilization resulting
from the annualization of the contract flying for Frontier. In
addition, Horizon will be adding a row of seats to the Q400
fleet increasing capacity from 70 to 74 seats. When
complete, this will result in an increase of approximately 1.5%
in available seat miles on an annualized basis.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2004 Compared with 2003

Our consolidated net loss for 2004 was $15.3 million, or
$0.57 per share, versus net income of $13.5 million,
or $0.51 per share, in 2003. The 2004 results include four
significant items which impact the comparability to 2003. These
items are discussed in the “Year in Review and Current
Events” section beginning on page 29. Our 2003 results
also include $71.4 million ($52.8 million for Alaska
and $18.6 million for Horizon, or a combined
$44.3 million net of tax or $1.66 per share) received
related to assistance from the government under the Emergency
Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act.

Our consolidated operating loss for 2004 was $79.8 million
compared to a loss of $17.5 million for 2003. Our
consolidated pre-tax loss for 2004 was $20.6 million
compared to pre-tax income of $29.0 million for



2003. Financial and statistical data comparisons for Alaska and
Horizon are shown on pages 18 and 19, respectively. On
pages 20 through 22, we have included a reconciliation of
reported non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures.

Alaska Airlines Revenues

Operating revenues increased $205.6 million, or 10.1%,
during 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003. The increase
in revenues resulted from an 11.5% increase in passenger
traffic, offset by a 1.4% decline in ticket yields. For the year
ended December 31, 2004, capacity increased 7.1% as
compared to 2003. The capacity increases are primarily due to
the annualization and expansion of our transcontinental flying,
including service from Seattle to Chicago and Los Angeles to
Reagan National in Washington D.C.. The traffic increase of
11.5% outpaced the capacity increase of 7.1%, resulting in an
increase in load factor from 70.0% to 72.9%. The decline in
yield per passenger mile was a result of continued industry-wide
pricing pressure, particularly in the fourth quarter where yield
declines were more substantial, dropping 5.8% compared to the
fourth quarter of 2003. We expect that load factors will
continue to be strong but that yields and passenger unit
revenues will continue to decline on a year-over-year basis into
the first half of 2005.

Freight and mail revenues increased $9.1 million, or 11.8%,
because of a new mail contract we have in the State of Alaska
offset by lower freight revenues.

Other-net revenues increased $13.3 million, or 12.1%, due
largely to revenues received from an agreement with Pen Air to
provide flight services to Dutch Harbor that began in January of
2004 and higher Mileage Plan revenues.

Alaska Airlines Expenses

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, total
operating expenses increased $271.6 million, or 13.3%, as
compared to the same period in 2003. Operating expenses per ASM
increased 5.8% from 9.84 cents in 2003 to 10.41 cents in 2004.
The increase in operating expenses per ASM is due largely to
significant increase in fuel costs, our restructuring charges,
the impairment charge related to our Boeing 737-200 fleet,
higher wages and benefits, contracted services costs and landing
fees and other rental costs offset by declines in other selling
expenses and commissions and the navigation fee recovery.
Operating expense per ASM excluding fuel, the navigation fee
recovery, restructuring and impairment charges decreased 5% to
7.92 cents per ASM compared to 8.34 cents per ASM in 2003.
Explanations of significant period-over-period changes in the
components of operating expenses are as follows:

•

Wages and benefits increased $19.9 million, or 3%, during
    2004. Approximately two thirds of the increase reflects higher
    pilot wages, substantially all of which is due to the 4% wage
    rate increase in May 2004 under the terms of our existing union
    contract . Wages were favorably impacted by the restructuring
    initiatives announced in August and September. During 2004,
    there were 9,968 FTEs, which is down by approximately 70 FTEs
    from 2003 on a 7.1% increase in capacity. Our current plan is
    for approximately 9,500 FTEs in 2005.

Benefits costs were favorably impacted by a $7.3 million
    reduction in workers compensation expense resulting from
    positive workers compensation claims experience at Alaska and a
    related reduction to ultimate loss estimates recorded in
    December totaling $6.6 million. In total, benefits costs
    were flat year over year.

Beginning in 2005, wages and benefits will include stock-based
    compensation associated with options granted to certain
    employees. Based on recent history, stock-based compensation
    expense associated with option grants is expected to be
    approximately $8 to $10 million per year (pre-tax). Since
    FAS 123R is effective for interim periods beginning after
    June 15, 2005 (our third quarter), we expect that only half
    that amount will be recorded in 2005.

•

Contracted services increased $14.9 million, or 18%, due
    largely to expenses associated with an agreement with PenAir to
    provide flight services to Dutch Harbor that began in January of
    2004, costs associated with a temporary charter contract we have
    for our new mail contract in Alaska and higher



security costs, partially offset by $8.6 million from the
    recovery in 2004 of disputed Mexico navigation fees paid in 2002
    and 2003.

•

Aircraft fuel increased $159.9 million, or 51%, due to a
    43.9% increase in the GAAP fuel cost per gallon and a 5.2%
    increase in fuel gallons consumed. The increase in aircraft fuel
    expense is inclusive of $14.6 million of gains from settled
    hedges. During 2004, Alaska also realized $25.2 million of
    hedge gains which are recorded in other non-operating income.
    After including all hedge gains recorded during the year, our
    “economic” fuel expense increased $140.1 million,
    or 45.7%, over 2003. Our economic fuel cost per gallon increased
    38.6% from 90.9 cents to 126.0 cents.

•

Aircraft maintenance decreased $7.6 million, or 5%, due
    largely to fewer engine overhauls during 2004 and a change in
    the mix of heavy maintenance versus routine maintenance.

We plan to change the accounting for engine and airframe
    overhauls at Alaska and Horizon, effective January 2005. Under
    the new method, we will charge the costs of these overhauls
    directly to expense, as opposed to our current practice of
    capitalizing and amortizing them. To effect this change, we will
    write off the unamortized portion of previously capitalized
    overhauls in January 2005 as a cumulative effect of an
    accounting change. We expect the one-time charge to be
    approximately $91 million, after tax.

Horizon Air Revenues

For the year ended December 31, 2004, operating revenues
increased $39.4 million, or 8.5% as compared to 2003. This
increase is due largely to the increased traffic in our native
network and our new contract flying for Frontier Airlines, which
began January 1, 2004, partially offset by a decline in the
incentive payments made by Alaska to Horizon. Incentive payments
are eliminated in consolidation.

The arrangement with Frontier provides for reimbursement of
expected costs plus a base mark up and certain incentives.
However, since Horizon is not responsible for many of the
typical costs of operations such as fuel, landing fees,
marketing costs and station labor and rents, revenue per ASM,
cost per ASM and cost per ASM excluding fuel for this flying is
significantly lower than Horizon’s native network flying.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, capacity
increased 20.9% and traffic was up 31.4%, compared to the same
period in 2003. Contract flying with Frontier represented
approximately 9.1% of passenger revenues and 21.4% of capacity,
during 2004. Passenger load factor increased 5.4 percentage
points to 69.3%. Passenger yield decreased 16.5% to 22.50 cents,
reflecting the inclusion of the Frontier contract flying, the
yield for which is significantly lower than native network
flying, and a decline in incentive payments from Alaska for feed
traffic. Contract revenue and higher yields in Horizon’s
native network combined with the increases in traffic, resulted
in an increase in passenger revenue of $42.5 million, or
9.6%.

Horizon Air Expenses

Operating expenses increased $36.8 million, or 8.1%, as
compared to the same period in 2003. Operating expenses per ASM
including fuel and the impairment charge decreased 10.5% as
compared to 2003. Operating expenses per ASM excluding fuel and
the impairment charge decreased 14.1% as compared to the same
period in 2003. Operating expenses in 2004 include
$3.4 million related to an impairment charge on our
held-for-sale F-28 aircraft and spare engines to lower the
carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value.
Explanations of other significant period-over-period changes in
the components of operating expenses are as follows:

Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense)

Net nonoperating income was $59.2 million in 2004 compared
to $46.5 million in 2003. Interest income increased
$11.7 million due to a larger marketable securities
portfolio in 2004 combined with a correction of



premium and discount amortization on our marketable securities
portfolio in 2003. 2004 interest income also includes
$3.3 million from the recovery in 2004 of disputed Mexico
navigation fees paid in 2002 and 2003. Interest expense (net of
capitalized interest) increased $4.7 million due to
increases in debt balances as compared to 2003.

Other-net includes $28.6 million and $6.4 million in
gains from settled fuel hedging contracts in 2004 and 2003,
respectively. In addition, other-net includes mark-to-market
gains on unsettled hedge contracts of $56.9 million in 2004.

The 2003 results include $71.4 million ($52.8 million
for Alaska and $18.6 million for Horizon) received in
connection with the government reimbursement of security fees
remitted and carrier fees paid under the Emergency Wartime
Supplemental Appropriations Act.

Consolidated Income Tax Benefit

Our consolidated effective income tax benefit for 2004 was 25.7%
compared to an effective income tax expense rate of 53.4% in
2003. Due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses, such as
employee per diem costs, relative to pre-tax profit or loss, a
relatively small change in pre-tax results can cause a
significant change in the effective tax rate.

2003 Compared with 2002

Our consolidated net income for 2003 was $13.5 million, or
$0.51 per share, compared with a net loss of
$118.6 million, or $4.47 per share, in 2002. Our 2003
results include $71.4 million ($52.8 million for
Alaska and $18.6 million for Horizon) received related to
assistance from the government under the Emergency Wartime
Supplemental Appropriations Act. Our 2002 net loss includes
$0.5 million received from the government and
$51.4 million related to the write-off of goodwill in
connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 (see
discussion in Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements). Excluding the government compensation
received in 2003 and 2002 and the goodwill write-off in 2002,
our net loss for 2003 was $30.8 million ($1.15 per
share) compared to $67.5 million ($2.54 per share) for
2002.

Our consolidated operating loss for 2003 was $17.5 million
compared to $93.2 million for 2002. Our consolidated
pre-tax income for 2003 was $29.0 million compared with a
consolidated pre-tax loss before accounting change of
$101.8 million for 2002. Financial and statistical data
comparisons for Alaska and Horizon are shown on pages 18
and 19, respectively. On pages 20 through 22, we have
included a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial
measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Alaska Airlines Revenues

Operating revenues increased $194.3 million, or 10.6%,
during 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002, reflecting
stronger summer demand and higher than expected fourth quarter
traffic as compared to 2002. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003, capacity increased 7.5% and traffic
increased 10.4% as compared to the same period in 2002. The
capacity increases are primarily due to the addition of service
to new cities (Boston, Denver, Newark, Washington D.C., Orlando
and Miami) and an increase in service in the Pacific Northwest,
Mexico, and Canada markets, partially offset by lower capacity
in the Bay Area, Arizona and Northern Alaska. During 2003,
roughly 75% of our ASM growth came from expansion in the
Transcontinental and Denver markets. Traffic increases primarily
reflect service to new cities and traffic increases in the
Pacific Northwest, Mexico and Nevada, partially offset by
decreases in traffic in the Bay Area, Northern Alaska and
Arizona. Higher traffic resulted in a $172.7 million, or
10.4%, increase in passenger revenues. Our passenger load factor
increased 1.9 percentage points to 70.0% during 2003 as
compared to 2002.

Our yield per passenger mile remained constant compared to 2002
due to a combination of longer average stage lengths, fewer
business travelers, and continued pricing pressure by low cost
carriers, partially offset by an increase in revenue from
expired Mileage Plan accounts.



Freight and mail revenues increased $5.2 million, or 7.2%,
due principally to higher freight and mail volumes attributable
to a reduction of security restrictions. Other-net revenues
increased $16.4 million, or 17.6%, due largely to cash
received from the sale of miles in our frequent flyer program
(impacting other revenue currently as a portion is recognized
immediately) and redemption of miles on partner airlines.

Alaska Airlines Expenses

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, total
operating expenses increased $136.1 million, or 7.1%, as
compared to the same period in 2002. This increase is due
largely to a 7.5% increase in ASMs combined with higher fuel,
maintenance, wages and benefits costs and landing fees and other
rentals. Operating expense per ASM decreased 0.3% as compared to
the same period in 2002 from 9.87 cents to 9.84 cents. Operating
expense per ASM excluding fuel decreased 2.1% as compared to the
same period in 2002 from 8.52 cents to 8.34 cents. Explanations
of significant period-over-period changes in the components of
operating expenses are as follows:



insurance program and competitive pressures in the aviation war
    risk insurance market. However, aviation insurance remains
    substantially higher than before September 11, 2001.

Horizon Air Revenues

Operating revenues increased $44.2 million, or 10.5%,
during 2003 as compared to 2002 due, in part, to an increase in
incentive payments from Alaska for feed traffic, which
eliminates in consolidation. For the twelve months ending
December 31, 2003, capacity increased 5.8% and traffic was
up 8.3%, compared to the same period in 2002. Passenger load
factor increased 1.5 percentage points to 63.9% during 2003
as compared to 2002. Passenger yield increased 3.6%, and
combined with the increase in traffic, resulted in an increase
in passenger revenue of $48.4 million, or 12.3%. The
increase in revenue and passenger yield resulted from improved
economic conditions, stronger summer demand and higher than
expected fourth quarter revenue passenger miles.

Other-net revenues decreased $4.2 million, or 20.3%,
primarily due to manufacturer payments received in 2002 as
compensation for delays in the delivery of CRJ 700 aircraft,
which did not recur in 2003.

Horizon Air Expenses

For the twelve months ending December 31, 2003, operating
expenses increased $23.2 million, or 5.3%, as compared to
the same period in 2002. This increase is due largely to a 5.8%
increase in ASMs combined with higher wages and benefits,
aircraft maintenance, landing fees and other rental costs.
Operating expenses per ASM decreased 0.5% as compared to the
same period in 2002 from 17.87 cents to 17.79 cents in 2003 and
2002, respectively. Operating expenses per ASM excluding fuel
decreased 1.2% as compared to the same period in 2002 from 15.99
cents to 15.80 cents in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Explanations of significant period-over-period changes in the
components of operating expenses are as follows:



reimbursement received during the latter part of 2003 resulting
    from clarification of an Air Group insurance liability, lower
    cost coverage from government aviation war risk insurance
    programs and competitive pressures in the aviation war risk
    insurance market.

Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense)

Net nonoperating items were $8.6 million expense in 2002
compared to $46.5 million income in 2003. The 2003 results
include $71.4 million ($52.8 million for Alaska and
$18.6 million for Horizon) received in connection with the
government reimbursement of security fees remitted and carrier
fees paid under the Act. Interest income decreased
$8.4 million due principally to lower interest rates and an
adjustment of premium and discount amortization on our
marketable securities portfolio. Interest expense (net of
capitalized interest) increased $1.9 million, due primarily
to increases in debt resulting from the completion of a private
placement of $150.0 million of floating rate senior
convertible notes in the first quarter of 2003. See discussion
at Note  4, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Other-net includes $8.1 million and $10.7 million in
gains resulting from hedge ineffectiveness on fuel hedging
contracts in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2003, we received
an insurance recovery of $3.1 million in connection with
legal fees associated with a U.S. Attorney investigation in
Oakland. In 2002, we received a $1.4 million insurance
recovery and a $0.9 million gain on conversion of Equant
N.V. shares (a telecommunications network company owned by many
airlines).

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Under this
statement, goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is
tested for impairment on a minimum of an annual basis. During
the second quarter of 2002, we completed the first step of our
impairment test related to our $51.4 million of goodwill.
The test was performed using Alaska and Horizon as separate
reporting units. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we completed the
second step of our impairment test and determined that all of
our goodwill was impaired. As a result, we recorded a one-time,
non-cash charge, effective January 1, 2002, of
$51.4 million ($12.5 million Alaska and
$38.9 million Horizon) to write-off all of our goodwill.
This charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting
change in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2002.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The discussion and analysis of our financial position and
results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and
results of operations. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a description of our significant accounting
policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those
that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties,
and potentially result in materially different results under
different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the
following critical accounting estimates. We have discussed the
development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our
audit committee.

Mileage Plan

Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member
passengers who fly on Alaska or Horizon and our travel partners.
Additionally, we sell miles to third parties, such as our credit
card partner, for cash. In either case, the outstanding miles
may be redeemed for travel on Alaska, Horizon, or any of our
alliance partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence,
we have an obligation to provide this future travel; therefore,
for awards earned by passengers who fly on Alaska, Horizon or
our travel partners, we recognize a liability and the
corresponding selling expense for this future obligation. For
miles sold to third parties, a majority of the sales proceeds
are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award
transportation



is provided. The deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger
revenue when awards are issued and flown on Alaska or Horizon,
and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on other
airlines.

At December 31, 2004, we had approximately 86 billion
miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability of
$409.3 million. The liability is computed based on several
assumptions that require significant management judgment to
estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in
estimates; therefore, an incorrect assumption impacts the amount
and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses.
The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage
Plan are described below.

1.

The number of miles that will not be redeemed for
travel:

Members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free
    ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for
    travel. Therefore, based on the number of Mileage Plan accounts
    and the miles in the accounts, we estimate how many miles will
    never be used (“breakage”), and do not record a
    liability for those miles. Our estimates of breakage consider
    activity in our members accounts, account balances, and other
    factors. We believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable. A
    hypothetical 1.0% change in our estimate of breakage (currently
    12% in the aggregate) has approximately a $4.5 million
    affect on the liability. However, actual breakage could differ
    significantly from our estimates given the dynamic nature of the
    program and our inability to predict our member’s future
    behavior.

2.

The number of miles used per award (i.e., free
ticket):

We estimate how many miles will be used per award. If actual
    miles used are more or less than estimated, we may need to
    adjust the liability and corresponding expense. Our estimates
    are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan
    program and historical redemptions on Alaska, Horizon or other
    airlines.

3.

The costs which will be incurred to carry the
passenger:

When the frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket,
    incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred
    to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs (excluding
    any contribution to overhead and profit) will be and accrue a
    liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an
    award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying
    the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated
    agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we
    would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we
    will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on
    historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and
    accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by
    us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the
    costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need
    to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense.

4.

Redemption on Alaska or Horizon versus other
airlines:

The cost for Alaska or Horizon to carry an award passenger is
    typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines. We
    estimate the number of awards which will be redeemed on Alaska
    or Horizon versus other airlines and accrue the costs on this
    based on our estimate of historical redemption patterns. If the
    number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower
    than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and
    corresponding expense.

5.

The rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold
miles:

We defer an amount that represents our estimate of the value of
    a free travel award. As fare levels change, our deferral rate
    changes, which may result in more or less recognition of cash
    proceeds in any given quarter.

We review all Mileage Plan estimates each quarter, and change
our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a
change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a
significant effect on our financial position and results of
operations.



Pension Plans

We account for the defined benefit pension plans using
SFAS No. 87, “Employer’s Accounting for
Pensions.” Under SFAS No. 87, pension expense is
recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate
service periods. Pension expense calculated under
SFAS No. 87 is generally independent of funding
decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our defined
benefit pension plans of $78.3 million, $73.5 million
and $40.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding
liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions,
including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can
result in different expense and liability amounts, and future
actual experience can differ from these assumptions. At
December 31, 2004, the fair value of our pension plan
assets totaled $607.0 million. We anticipate making a cash
contribution of approximately $58 million during 2005.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on
pension plan assets decreases. At December 31, 2004, we
estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term
rate of return of 8.0%. This rate is equal to the assumed rate
of 8.0% used at December 31, 2003, and was developed by
evaluating input from consultants and economists as well as
long-term inflation assumptions. We regularly review the actual
asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as
considered appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets at December 31, 2004 is based on an
allocation of U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income
securities. Decreasing the expected long-term rate of return by
0.5% (from 8.0% to 7.5%) would increase our estimated 2005
pension expense by approximately $3.1 million.

Pension liability and future pension expense increase as the
discount rate is reduced. We discounted future pension
obligations using a rate of 5.75% and 6.00% at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The discount rate is determined
based on the current rates earned on high quality long-term
bonds. Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5% (from 5.75% to
5.25%) would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at
December 31, 2004 by approximately $52.0 million and
increase estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately
$8.7 million.

The defined benefit plan for management personnel was closed to
new entrants in 2003. We are working to restructure the defined
benefits plans for other labor groups. Any such change could
impact future pension expense and pension liabilities.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and
various other factors related to the participants in our pension
plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We
cannot predict what these factors will be in the future.

Long-lived Assets

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately
$1.9 billion of property and equipment and related assets.
In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates
about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected
residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment
based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they
generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but
are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of
the long-lived assets, a significant change in the long-lived
assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with
the use of the long-lived asset.

In 2002, 2003 and 2004, due to volatile economic conditions and
indications of declining aircraft market values, we evaluated
whether the book value of our aircraft was impaired in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” No impairment
was necessary based on the results of the evaluations except as
related to the B737-200C fleet and Horizon’s idle Fokker
F-28 aircraft and spare engines as described above. See
page 24.

There is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used
in the impairment test. If cash flows do not materialize as
estimated, there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to
date may be inaccurate, or further impairment charges may be
necessary in the future.



Workers Compensation and Employee Health Care Accruals

The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance
mechanisms to provide for workers’ compensation claims and
employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the
risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and
are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims
experience and outside expertise, severity factors and other
actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these
liabilities could be significantly affected if future
occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and
historical trends.

Restructuring accruals

During the third quarter of 2004, Alaska announced a management
reorganization and the closure of its Oakland maintenance base,
contracting out of the related heavy maintenance, contracting
out of the Company’s Fleet Service Ground, Support
Equipment and facility maintenance functions and other
initiatives. Total severance and related costs associated with
this restructuring are estimated at $53.4 million. Our
severance package offered to impacted employees included cash
payments based on years of service and one year of medical
coverage after severance date. Since Alaska self-insures for
employee medical coverage, we estimated the projected claims
cost for affected employees and recorded a corresponding
accrual. Actual experience will likely differ from the estimate
if employees accept positions with other employers and no longer
need the coverage provided by Alaska or simply submit claims
during the one year period that are higher or lower than our
estimate. We expect to adjust this accrual quarterly throughout
2005.

Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets

The Company has a net deferred tax liability of
$98.9 million at December 31, 2004, which includes
gross deferred tax assets of $396.1 million offset by a
gross deferred tax liability of $495.0 million. In
accordance with SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for
Income Taxes.”

, we have evaluated whether it is more
likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized.
Based on the available evidence, we have concluded that it is
more likely than not that those assets would be realizable and
thus no valuation allowance has been recorded as of
December 31, 2004. Our conclusion is based on the expected
future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and
does not rely on future taxable income. Should we incur
additional losses in the future, our ability to realize the net
operating loss carryforwards may be subject to greater
uncertainty. We will continue to reassess the need for a
valuation allowance during each future reporting period.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, our cash and
marketable securities increased $61.6 million to
$873.9 million. This increase reflects cash provided by
operating activities of $334.0 million, offset by cash used
in financing activities of $106.9 million, cash used for
property and equipment additions of $167.5 million and net
purchases of marketable securities of $204.5 million.



Cash Provided by Operating Activities

During 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was
$334.0 million, compared to $355.2 million during
2003. Operating cash inflows in 2003 included $71.4 million
of government compensation, whereas cash inflows in 2004
included $42.7 million of cash received from a tax refund.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities was $365.7 million during
2004, compared to $638.1 million in 2003. We had net
purchases of $204.5 million of marketable securities and
$167.5 million for property and equipment. During 2004, our
aircraft related capital expenditures decreased
$188.6 million as compared to 2003, reflecting a reduction
in spending for new aircraft and capitalized overhauls.
Beginning January 1, 2005, we will have no capital
expenditures related to overhauls as those maintenance
activities will be expensed as incurred under our maintenance
accounting policy that will be adopted on that date.

Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $106.9 million
during 2004 compared to net cash provided by financing
activities of $206.8 million during 2003. Debt issuances
during 2004 of $94.6 million were secured by flight
equipment. These debt issuances have interest rates that vary
with the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and payment
terms ranging from 12 to 16 years. Debt issuances during
the period were offset by normal long-term debt payments of
$59.9 million and full repayment of our credit facility of
$150 million. In 2003, we completed the private placement
of $150 million of floating rate senior convertible notes.

We plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through
cash flow from operations and cash and marketable securities on
hand at December 31, 2004 totaling $873.9 million. We
also have restricted cash of $12.6 million, which is
intended to collateralize interest payments due in the next two
years on our $150 million floating rate senior convertible
notes due 2023 issued in 2003.

Bank Line of Credit Facility

During 2004, Alaska paid off its $150 million credit
facility and, on December  23, 2004, that facility
expired. Management is currently negotiating a replacement
facility and expects to close the new facility during the first
quarter of 2005, although there can be no assurance that this
can be accomplished on terms acceptable to us.

The $150 million credit facility that expired in December
2004 contained contractual restrictions, required maintenance of
specific levels of net worth, maintenance of certain debt and
leases to net worth, leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios,
and limits on investments, lease obligations, sales of assets,
and additional indebtedness. Such provisions also limited the
amount of funds Alaska Airlines can distribute via dividend to
Alaska Air Group. The notes did not restrict the ability of our
subsidiaries to enter into additional agreements limiting or
prohibiting the distribution of earnings, loans or other
payments to Alaska Air Group. As noted above, we are currently
negotiating with a replacement facility and hope to have that
agreement completed by the end of the first quarter. We expect
that the new line of credit facility will be at least as
restrictive as the prior credit facility.

Convertible Notes

In 2003, Alaska Air Group completed the private placement of
$150.0 million of floating rate senior convertible notes
due in 2023 pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. Net proceeds from the offering were
$144.9 million, of which $22.3 million was used to
acquire U.S. government securities to fund the first three
years of interest payments. In 2003, we made a capital
contribution to Alaska Airlines of the remaining net proceeds
from the sale of the notes. Alaska Airlines has used the
remaining proceeds from the notes for working capital
requirements and expects in the future to continue to use these
remaining proceeds for working capital requirements as well as
other general corporate purposes. Although we have not yet
determined how each payment of principal or interest due will be
funded in the future, we anticipate that



these payments will be funded either by dividends,
distributions, loans, advances or other payments from our
subsidiaries or through new borrowings or financings by Alaska
Air Group. Any such payments by our subsidiaries to Air Group
could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions.

The holders of the $150.0 million of floating rate senior
convertible notes due in 2023 may elect to have the Company
redeem all or a portion of the notes on the 5th, 10th and 15th
anniversaries of the date of issuance. On September 30,
2004, we entered into the First Supplemental Indenture with
respect to the Notes to rescind the Company’s right to pay
for such a repurchase of the Notes at the option of the holders,
in whole or in part, in shares of our common stock. Pursuant to
the terms of the notes, as amended, any such repurchases shall
be paid for in cash.

Supplemental Disclosure of Noncash Investing and Financing
    Activities

During 2004, Horizon financed three Bombardier Q400s under
long-term debt arrangements totaling $44.7 million. These
debt arrangements have a 15-year term and interest rates that
vary with LIBOR. Two of the aircraft were originally leased in
January 2004 and were treated as capital leases at that time.
The resulting re-financing transactions did not result in any
gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

Aircraft Purchase Commitments

At December 31, 2004, we had firm orders for 12 aircraft
requiring aggregate payments of approximately
$291.1 million, as set forth below. In addition, Alaska had
options to acquire 26 additional B737’s, and Horizon had
options to acquire 15 Q400’s and 25 CRJ 700’s. Alaska
and Horizon expect to finance the firm orders and to the extent
exercised, the option aircraft with leases, long-term debt or
internally generated cash. One B737-800 was delivered in
February 2005, and two others are expected in March and July of
2005. We have secured lease financing for the March delivery. We
purchased the B737-800 aircraft delivered in February 2005 with
cash on hand at the time, and expect to do the same for the July
delivery. We expect to finance the CRJ700 delivered in 2005 with
debt financing.

The following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and
payments by year, as of December 31, 2004:

New Accounting Standards

In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
(FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a
consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments,” (EITF 03-1). The guidance prescribes a
three-step model for determining whether an investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about
unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is
effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15,
2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual
reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September
2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-1-1,
“Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No.
03-1 “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
Its Application to Certain Investments,” (FSP
EITF 03-01-1). FSP EITF 03-1-1 delays the effective
date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in
paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue 03-01. During the
period of the delay, FSP EITF 03-1-1 states that
companies should continue to apply relevant
“other-than-temporary” guidance. The Company will
assess the impact of paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1
once the guidance has been finalized. At December 31, 2004,
available-for-sale investments in the Company’s marketable
securities portfolio had unrealized losses totaling
$4.0 million which are recorded in Other Accumulated
Comprehensive Income. Management does not believe that the
securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2004
meet the criteria for recognizing the loss under existing
other-than-temporary guidance.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS 123R, “Share Based
Payments: An Amendment of FASB No. 123 and 95”. The
new standard requires companies to recognize in the income
statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other
equity based



compensation issued to employees. This new standard will apply
to both stock options that we grant to employees and our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which features a look-back
provision and allows employees to purchase stock at a discount
in excess of 5%. Our options are typically granted with graded
vesting provisions, and we intend to amortize compensation cost
over the service period using the straight line method. This new
statement is effective for interim or annual periods beginning
after June 15, 2005 (our third quarter of 2005). We intend
to use the “modified prospective method” upon adoption
whereby previously awarded but unvested equity awards are
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R but prospective
amounts are recognized in the income statement instead of simply
being disclosed. Our stock based compensation expense, as
measured under SFAS 123, approximates $8 to
$10 million per year on a pre-tax basis.

During the third quarter of 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) affirmed its tentative conclusion reached in July of
2004 on EITF Issue No. 04-08, “The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted EPS” (EITF 04-08).
EITF 04-08 requires companies to include certain
contingently convertible securities in the calculation of
diluted EPS to the extent the inclusion of the shares would not
be anti-dilutive beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Because the Company’s convertible notes fall under the
scope of EITF 04-08 , the Company expects to report a lower
diluted EPS to the extent the convertible notes are not
anti-dilutive. Retroactive application of EITF 04-08 is
required and our quarterly data in Item 8 has been revised
accordingly. The notes were anti-dilutive for the fourth quarter
and full year of 2004.

The following example illustrates the application of this
consensus on the third quarter of 2004:

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.”
FIN 46, as amended by FIN 46 (Revised) in December
2003, requires consolidation of certain types of entities in
which the Company absorbs a majority of the entity’s
expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s
expected returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual
or other financial interests in the entity. These entities are
called “variable interest entities.” The principal
characteristics of variable interest entities are (1) an
insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity’s
expected losses, (2) equity owners as a group are not able
to make decisions about the entity’s activities, and
(3) equity that does not absorb the entity’s losses or
receive the entity’s residual returns. Variable interests
are contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in an
entity that change with fluctuations in the entity’s net
asset value. As a result, variable interest entities can arise
from items such as lease agreements, loan arrangements,
guarantees or service contracts.

If an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the
entity must be consolidated by the “primary
beneficiary”. The primary beneficiary is the holder of the
variable interests that absorbs a majority of the variable
interest entity’s expected losses or receives a majority of
the entity’s residual returns in the event no holder has a
majority of the expected losses. There is no primary beneficiary
in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the
expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns.
The determination of the primary beneficiary is based on
qualitative aspects of the arrangements involved or projected
cash flows at the inception of the transaction with the variable
interests entity.



FIN 46 was applicable to financial statements of companies
that have interests in “special purpose entities”, as
defined, during the year ended 2003.

We are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering our
leased aircraft. In many instances, the lessors are trusts
established by a third party specifically to purchase, finance
and lease aircraft to us. These leasing entities meet the
criteria for variable interest entities. However, they do not
meet the consolidation requirements of FIN 46 because we
are not the primary beneficiary of the entity’s expected
gains or losses. Our conclusions are based on the fact that the
leasing arrangements involved contain terms which are consistent
with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not
include residual value guarantees made by us, fixed-price
purchase obligations or similar features that obligate us to
absorb the majority of expected losses of the variable interest
entities. Our maximum exposure under these types of lease
arrangements is the remaining lease payments, which are
reflected in future lease commitments in Note 5 (plus the
cost, if any, of bringing the equipment into compliance with the
physical condition required for return).

Effect of Inflation

— Inflation and price
changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant
effect on our operating revenues, operating expenses and
operating income.



RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various
uncertainties, such as global and industry instability, intense
competition, volatile fuel prices, a largely unionized labor
force, the need to finance large capital expenditures,
government regulation, potential aircraft incidents and general
economic conditions. If any of the following occurs, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could
suffer. In such case, the trading price of our common stock
could also decline.

The airline industry is highly competitive and subject to
    rapid change. We may be unable to compete effectively against
    other airlines with greater financial resources or lower
    operating costs, or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the
    basis of competition in our markets changes.

The airline industry is highly competitive as to fares, flight
frequency, frequent flyer benefits, routes and service. The
industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting
because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to
passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. We currently
compete with one or more other airlines on substantially all of
our routes. Many of these airlines are larger and have
significantly greater financial resources and name recognition
or lower operating costs than our company. Others are operating
under bankruptcy court protection and run lower costs more
quickly than we can. Some of these competitors have chosen from
time to time to add service, reduce their fares, or both, in our
markets. We may be unable to compete effectively against other
airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the
markets that we serve.

Our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets, including
Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles and Anchorage. Significant
portions of our flights occur to and from our Seattle hub. In
2004, this traffic to and from Seattle accounted for 63% of
total traffic. We believe that concentrating our service
offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in
personnel, aircraft and ground operations, as well as to gain
greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in these
regions. As a result, we remain highly dependent upon our key
markets. Our business would be harmed by any circumstances
causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key
markets, such as adverse changes in local economic conditions,
negative public perception of a key market and significant price
increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees
imposed on passengers. An increase in competition in our key
markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other
competitive measures that harm our operating results.

Many airlines, including ours, have code share and frequent
flyer marketing alliances with other airlines. Internet
distribution arrangements either in conjunction with other
airlines or with independent travel websites have become an
important means for selling airline travel. Any consolidation or
significant alliance activity within the airline industry, or
our loss of key alliance or distribution relationships, could
result in our competitors having access to increased route
networks and resources, which, in turn, would increase the risks
of competition described above.

The airline industry, particularly the regional airlines, also
faces competition from ground transportation alternatives, such
as the bus, train or automobile. Video teleconferencing and
other methods of electronic communication may add a new
dimension of competition to the industry as business travelers
seek lower-cost substitutes for air travel.

Our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations are substantially exposed to the current high prices
    and variability of jet fuel. Further increases in jet fuel costs
    would harm our business.

Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total
operating expenses, comprising 19% of total operating expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2004. Significant increases
in fuel costs during 2004 have negatively impacted our results
of operations. Further increases would harm our financial
condition and results of operations. We estimate that during the
year ended December 31, 2004 and during the year ended
December 31, 2003 a one-cent increase in the price per
gallon of fuel would have increased our fuel expenses by
$4.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Average
economic fuel prices (which include the benefits of our hedging
program) during 2004 were 35.3 cents higher than in 2003. Total
fuel costs, net of the benefit received from fuel hedges settled
during the period were $177.4 million higher in 2004
compared to 2003.



Historically, fuel costs have been unpredictable and subject to
wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply
and demand. Fuel availability is also subject to periods of
market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for both
home heating oil and gasoline. Because of the effect of these
events on the price and availability of fuel, the cost and
future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree
of certainty. In the event of a fuel supply shortage, higher
fuel prices or the curtailment of scheduled service could
result. Some of our competitors may have more leverage in
obtaining fuel. We may be unable to offset increases in the
price of fuel through higher fares. We utilize our fuel hedges
as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel
prices. To hedge our exposure to fuel price fluctuations, we
began purchasing hedging instruments, primarily instruments that
cap the price paid. At December 31, 2004, we had fuel hedge
contracts in place to hedge 50% of our anticipated fuel
consumption in 2005 and 35% and 9% of our anticipated fuel
consumption in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Even with hedges, we
are substantially exposed to increases in jet fuel costs.

If we are unable to meet our cost reduction goals, our
    results of operations and financial condition may suffer.

We, along with other airlines, have announced aggressive cost
reduction goals that are an important part of our business
strategy of offering the best value to passengers through
competitive fares while at the same time achieving acceptable
profit margins and return on capital. We believe having a lower
cost structure better positions us to be able to grow our
business and take advantage of market opportunities.

We have implemented initiatives that we believe will reduce our
annual operating costs by approximately $185 million and
seek additional savings of approximately $155 million, the
majority of which is being sought from our labor groups and, to
a lesser extent, additional cost reductions in ticket
distribution, maintenance, and other costs. We hope to achieve
labor savings through a combination of market-based wage
adjustments, a common health and retirement benefits package for
every work group, and work rule changes focusing on greater
efficiency in operations. We cannot be certain that we will be
able to implement changes in our operations sufficient to
generate this level of additional targeted savings, or that if
such changes are implemented, that forecasted savings will be
achieved. In the event that we are unable to achieve our cost
reduction goals, or our efforts prove less successful than those
of our competitors, our results of operations will likely be
below our own expectations and may be below those of outside
financial analysts, and our financial condition may be harmed.

Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining
    agreements. A failure to negotiate new agreements, or to do so
    on terms competitive with the labor costs and practices of our
    competitors, could disrupt our business and increase our
    costs.

As of December 31, 2004, labor unions represented 83% of
Alaska’s and 45% of Horizon’s employees. Labor costs
generally are a significant component of our total expenses,
comprising approximately 35% of our total operating expenses in
2004. Each of our different employee groups has separate
collective bargaining agreements, and may make demands that
would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our
profitability.

At December 31, 2004 we were in contract talks with most
labor groups and had submitted to binding arbitration with the
Airline Pilots Association (ALPA). The degree to which we meet
our overall labor savings goals will be determined to a large
extent by the results of the pilot arbitration.

The pilot contract provides that, if an agreement on the entire
contract was not reached by December 15, 2004, ten contract
issues plus wage rates would be submitted to an interest
arbitrator. Issues submitted generally relate to pension plans,
medical insurance, profit sharing, code sharing and work rules.
The parties did not reach an agreement, and the issues have been
submitted to binding arbitration in March 2005 with a decision
to be effective in May 2005. The pilot labor contract contains
market related standards for wages and non-wage issues.

If we were unable to reach agreement on the terms of any
collective bargaining agreement with any group of our employees
or were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we
could be subject to work



slowdowns or stoppages. We could also become subject to protests
or picketing by organized labor groups representing our
employees. Any of these events would be disruptive to our
operations and could harm our business. In the event any
agreement we reach with an organized labor group requires us to
pay wages or to incur costs that are materially higher than
those we currently pay or we are unable to fully offset such
increased costs through fare increases, our expenses would
increase and our operating margin would be harmed.

Weakness in the general economy, and in the airline
    industry in particular, could have an adverse effect on our
    business.

We believe that airline traffic, including business traffic, is
particularly sensitive to changes in economic growth and
expectations. Weak economic growth in 2001 through the first
half of 2003, low ticket yields, and escalating fuel prices
contributed to much of the airline industry suffering
significant losses from 2001 through 2004. Currently, US
Airways, United Airlines and ATA Airlines, as well as other
carriers, operate under bankruptcy protection. Because airlines
operating under bankruptcy protection receive increased
flexibility to reduce their costs by voiding contracts and
renegotiating existing business obligations, current and future
airline bankruptcies could have a substantial impact on industry
competition. In the event airlines who have received bankruptcy
protection choose to apply some or all of the cost savings they
obtain toward reduced fares, bankruptcy by airlines who compete
with us may cause us to reduce our fares and result in a
substantial reduction in revenue and operating margin. Continued
weakness in the airline industry may also result in additional
industry consolidation, greater reliance on industry alliances,
such as code sharing and frequent flyer reciprocity
arrangements, and increased price competition among existing
carriers, each of which could dramatically alter the competitive
environment in the markets we serve and harm our operating
results. Continued weak economic performance in the airline
industry may also result in a further reduction in our credit
rating and make it more difficult for us to raise capital on
economical terms. Any general reduction in airline passenger
traffic as a result of a soft economy would harm our business.

We rely heavily on automated systems to operate our
    business and any failure of these systems could harm our
    business.

We depend on automated systems to operate our business,
including our computerized airline reservation system, our
telecommunication systems and our website. We also issue a
substantial number of our tickets to passengers as electronic
tickets. We depend on our computerized reservation system to be
able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. In
order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and
reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of
traffic and deliver important flight information. Substantial or
repeated website, reservations system or telecommunication
systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services
and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another
airline. Any disruption in these systems could result in the
loss of important data, increase our expenses and generally harm
our business.

Increases in government taxes and fees could reduce demand
    for air travel and harm our business

Airlines pay or are responsible for collecting a number of
different taxes and fees including, but not limited to, fuel
taxes, airport facility charges, immigration fees, security
fees, excise taxes on ticket sales, and fuel taxes. Recently,
the United States Department of Homeland Security proposed
raising the aviation security fee from $2.50 per one-way
segment to $5.50 per one-way segment.

We believe the demand for air travel is highly sensitive to fare
levels. Although law makers may impose additional fees and view
them as “pass through costs”, we believe that a higher
total ticket price in the eyes of the consumer will influence
their purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall
decline in passenger traffic, which would harm our business.

Moreover, we believe that the impact of higher fees is
proportionally greater for low fare carriers, carriers with a
high percentage of leisure travelers, and carriers that fly
relatively short segments. Because Alaska



carriers many leisure travels and Horizon flies many short haul
segments, we believe higher security fees and (other fee
increases generally) could negatively impact Air Group more than
some of our competitors.

The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks negatively
    impacted our industry and our business and further threatened or
    actual terrorist attacks, or other hostilities involving the
    U.S., may significantly harm our industry and our business in
    the future.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their
aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry,
including our company. Because a substantial portion of our
costs are fixed in the short-term, we were unable to offset the
reduction in customer demand through cost savings, and operating
results were harmed to a proportionately greater degree.
Additional terrorist attacks, the fear of such attacks or other
hostilities involving the U.S. could have a further
significant negative impact on the airline industry, including
us, and could:

Our insurance costs have increased as a result of the
    September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and further increases
    in insurance costs would harm our business, financial condition
    and results of operations.

Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks,
aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance
premiums and significantly reduced the maximum amount of
insurance available to airlines for third-party claims resulting
from acts of terrorism, war or similar events to
$50 million per event and in the aggregate. In light of
this development, under the Air Transportation Safety and
Stabilization Act, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended
by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, the government
is currently offering domestic airlines either
(i) third-party liability war risk coverage above
$50 million, or (ii) in lieu of commercial war risk
insurance, full hull, comprehensive and third-party liability
war risk coverage. This coverage provides for the same limits of
hull and comprehensive insurance and twice the limits of
third-party liability insurance carried by the airline on
September 11, 2001.

Aviation insurers could increase their premiums even further in
the event of additional terrorist attacks, hijackings, airline
accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline
industry. Furthermore, the full hull, comprehensive and
third-party war risk insurance provided by the government is
mandated through August 31, 2005. While the government may
extend the deadline for when it will stop providing such
coverage, we cannot be certain that any extension will occur, or
if it does, how long the extension will last. It is expected
that, should the government stop providing such coverage to the
airline industry, the premiums charged by aviation insurers for
this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums
currently charged by the government. Significant increases in
insurance premiums would adversely impact our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in government regulation imposing additional
    requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase
    our operating costs and result in service delays and
    disruptions.

Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal
requirements, both domestically and internationally, that
involve significant compliance costs. In the last several years,
Congress has passed laws, and the DOT and the FAA have issued
regulations, relating to the operation of airlines that have
required significant expenditures. Additional laws, regulations,
taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time



to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline
operations or reduce the demand for air travel. If adopted,
these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices,
reducing revenue and/or increasing costs.

Our reputation and financial results could be harmed in
    the event of an airline accident or incident.

An accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could
involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith
in our airlines by the flying public. In addition, we could
experience significant potential claims from injured passengers
and surviving relatives, as well as costs for the repair or
replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential
temporary or permanent loss from service. Although we believe
that we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of
the type generally consistent with industry practice, the amount
of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to
bear substantial losses from an accident. Substantial claims
resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance
coverage would harm our business and financial results.
Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully
insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines,
could cause a public perception that our airlines or the
equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other
transportation alternatives, which would harm our business.

Our operations are often affected by factors beyond our
    control, including traffic congestion at airports, weather
    conditions and increased security measures, any of which could
    harm our financial condition and results of operations.

Like other airlines, our operations are subject to delays caused
by factors beyond our control, including air traffic congestion
at airports, adverse weather conditions and increased security
measures. Delays frustrate passengers, reduce aircraft
utilization and increase costs, all of which in turn affect our
profitability. During periods of fog, snow, rain, freezing rain,
storms or other adverse weather conditions, flights may be
canceled or significantly delayed. Due to our geographic area of
operations, we believe a significant portion of our operation is
more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than many of our
competitors. Cancellations or delays due to weather conditions,
traffic control problems and breaches in security could harm our
financial condition and results of operations.

If Alaska fails to comply with financial covenants, some
    of its financing agreements may be terminated.

Alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants
in certain agreements. Although our $150 million revolving
credit facility expired in December 2004, we are currently
negotiating a replacement facility. We expect this facility to
have covenants that are as restrictive, if not more, than those
in our recently expired agreement. We cannot ensure that Alaska
will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or
that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance
our future operations or capital needs. Alaska’s inability
to comply with the required financial maintenance covenants or
provisions could result in default under these financing
agreements and could result in a cross default under
Alaska’s other financing agreements. In the event of any
such default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the
default, all amounts outstanding under the agreements could be
declared to be immediately due and payable. If Alaska did not
have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that became
due and payable, Air Group or Alaska would have to seek
additional debt or equity financing, which may not be available
on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing were not
available, Alaska would have to sell assets in order to obtain
the funds required to make accelerated payments or risk its
aircraft becoming subject to repossession, which could harm our
business.

Our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract
    and retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs.

Our business is labor intensive, with labor costs representing
approximately 35% of our operating expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2004. We expect salaries, wages and benefits
to increase on a gross basis and that these costs could increase
as a percentage of our overall costs, which could harm our
business. We compete against the major U.S. airlines for
labor in many highly skilled positions. If we are unable to
hire, train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost,
or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be



unable to grow or sustain our business and our operating results
and business prospects could be harmed. We may also have
difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave
and, therefore, the loss of any of these individuals could harm
our business.

We rely on third-party vendors for certain critical
    activities

We have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of
services and functions critical to our business, including
airframe and engine maintenance, ground handling, fueling,
catering, computer reservation system hosting and software
maintenance. As part of its cost control efforts, the reliance
on outside vendors will increase. In September 2004, Alaska
Airlines announced that it was sub-contracting the remaining
heavy aircraft maintenance that it was then performing to
outside vendors. In addition, Alaska retained outside suppliers
for fleet service and facilities maintenance. In January 2005,
Alaska signed an agreement with a vendor for ground handling
services at Seattle in the event that it does not reach an
agreement with the IAM representing its ramp employees.

Our increased use of outside vendors increases our exposure to
several risks. In the event that one or more vendors goes into
bankruptcy, ceases operation or fails to perform as promised,
replacement services may not be readily available at competitive
rates, or at all. Vendor bankruptcies, unionization, regulatory
compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive
marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor
services or force Alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on
less favorable terms. These events could result in disruptions
in Alaska’s operations or increases in its cost structure.

We have incurred operating losses in each year since 2000
    and may incur substantial operating losses in the future. In
    addition, our quarterly results can fluctuate
    substantially.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, Air Group incurred an
operating loss of $79.8 million. Prior to that, we incurred
operating losses of $17.5 million and $93.2 million
for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The inability to achieve or sustain profitability
may hinder our ability to honor our existing obligations as they
become due, to obtain future equity or debt financing or to do
so on economical terms, and to sustain and expand our business.

In addition, our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially
due to a variety of factors including seasonal variations in
traffic, the timing of various expenditures, and weather.
Because expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly
with the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change
in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate
effect on an airline’s operating and financial results.
Accordingly, a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could
cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating
results. Due to these factors, as well as other risk factors
described in this Form 10-K, quarter-to-quarter comparisons
of our results may not be good indicators of our future
performance. In addition, it is possible that in any future
quarter our operating results could be below expectations of
investors and any published reports or analyses regarding our
company. In that event, the price of Air Group’s common
stock could decline, perhaps substantially.

Our indebtedness could increase the volatility of earnings
    and otherwise restrict our activities.

We have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a
significant amount of indebtedness. Due to our high fixed costs,
including aircraft lease commitments and debt service, a
decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater
decrease in earnings. As of December 31, 2004, we had
approximately $1,043.0 million of indebtedness outstanding,
approximately $892.5 million of which was secured by flight
equipment and real property.

Our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences.
For example, it could:

•

limit our ability to obtain additional financing for funding our
    growth strategy, capital expenditures, acquisitions, working
    capital or other purposes,

•

require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash
    flow to fund interest payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing
    funds available for other purposes, and



•

limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce
    our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic
    conditions, including reacting to any economic slowdown in the
    airline industry.

In addition, we have an ongoing need to finance new aircraft
deliveries, and there is no assurance that such financing will
be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.

Horizon’s results are partly dependent on Frontier
    JetExpress, which is dependent on Frontier Airlines.

Horizon operates regional jet service branded as Frontier
JetExpress under a 12-year agreement with Frontier Airlines that
began in January 2004. Currently, that flying represents
approximately 23% of Horizon’s total capacity and 9.9% of
Horizon’s passenger revenue. Under the arrangement,
Frontier Airlines pays Horizon the expected costs of providing
the service plus a base markup. If Frontier were to have
financial difficulties and find it necessary to terminate the
agreement, we would have significant excess capacity that we
would have to deploy elsewhere. There can be no assurance that
this excess capacity could be deployed in profitable markets and
our unit operating costs would likely increase.

A downgrade in our corporate credit rating may indicate a
    decline in our business and in our ability to make interest or
    principal payments on our outstanding debt.

In 2003, Air Group’s credit ratings were downgraded by both
S&P and Moody’s. On March 14, 2003, the senior
implied rating for Alaska Air Group was downgraded from Ba3 to
B1 by Moody’s with a commensurate reduction in other
ratings. On September 4, 2003, Standard &
Poor’s announced that it lowered the corporate credit
rating from BB to BB- with a commensurate reduction in other
ratings. We cannot be assured that our corporate credit ratings
will not decline in the future. If any of our ratings decline,
this may indicate a decline in our business and may affect the
trading prices, if any, of our common stock or convertible notes
and may make additional borrowing more expensive and difficult
to obtain.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET
    RISK

We have interest rate risk in our floating rate debt obligations
and our available for sale marketable investment portfolio, and
commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate our
aircraft fleet. We purchase jet fuel at prevailing market
prices, and seek to manage market risk through execution of a
documented hedging strategy. We have market sensitive
instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and
financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to
jet fuel price increases. We do not purchase or hold any
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Fuel Hedging

We purchase jet fuel at prevailing market prices, and seek to
manage the risk of price fluctuations through execution of a
documented hedging strategy. We utilize derivative financial
instruments as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility
of jet fuel prices. We believe there is risk in not hedging
against the possibility of fuel price increases. At
December 31, 2004, we had fuel hedge contracts in place to
hedge 207.3 million gallons of our expected jet fuel
usage during 2005, 148.8 million gallons in 2006 and
38.6 million gallons in 2007. This represents 50%, 35% and
9% of our anticipated fuel consumption in 2005, 2006 and 2007,
respectively. Prices of these agreements range from $28.81 to
$42.65 per crude oil barrel. We estimate that a 10%
increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of December 31,
2004 would impact hedging positions by approximately
$20.0 million.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair values of our
fuel hedge positions were $96.0 million and
$18.4 million, respectively. Of these amounts,
$65.7 million of the 2004 fair value amounts and
$12.0 million of the 2003 fair value amounts were included
in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated
balance sheets based on settlement dates for the underlying
contracts. The remaining $30.3 million 2004 fair value and
$6.4 million 2003 fair value is reflected in other assets
in the consolidated balance sheets.

Please refer to Item 6 on pages 20 through 22, as
well as to Note 10 in the consolidated financial
statements, for company specific data on the results of our fuel
hedging program.



Financial Market Risk

We have exposure to market risk associated with changes in
interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and
short-term investment portfolio. Our debt obligations include
variable rates, which have exposure to changes in interest
rates. A hypothetical 10% change in the average interest rates
incurred on variable rate debt during 2004 would correspondingly
change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these
items by approximately $4.3 million.

We also have investments in marketable securities, which are
exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest
rates. If short-term interest rates were to average 1% more
than they did in 2004, interest income would increase by
approximately 20 basis points.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
    ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

On August 10, 2004 , Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group)
determined for itself and on behalf of its subsidiaries, Alaska
Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.
(Horizon), to dismiss its independent auditors,
Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte) and to select KPMG LLP
(KPMG) to serve as its new independent auditors for the
year ending December 31, 2004. The dismissal of Deloitte
and engagement of KPMG was approved by Air Group’s Audit
Committee. On August 10, 2004, Deloitte was notified of
their dismissal.

Deloitte’s report on Air Group’s financial statements
for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, and
December 31, 2002 did not contain an adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except the
report contained an explanatory paragraph relating to the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”.

There were no disagreements with KPMG LLP or Deloitte &
Touche LLP on accounting or financial disclosure matters during
2004.



ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2004, an evaluation was performed under
the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer (collectively, our “certifying officers”), of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. These disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that the information required
to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the SEC’s rules and forms, and that the
information is communicated to our certifying officers on a
timely basis.

Our certifying officers concluded, based on their evaluation,
that disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

We made no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31,
2004, that our certifying officers concluded materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, our
internal control over financial reporting, except with respect
to our Mileage Plan deferred revenue calculation as described in
the next paragraph.

In December 2004, we discovered a clerical error in our
calculation of deferred Mileage Plan revenue that existed at
September 30, 2004. As a result, we revised our third
quarter and year to date condensed consolidated financial
statements to adjust for this item. In response to this finding,
management has taken appropriate steps to strengthen preventive
and detective internal controls over the Mileage Plan deferred
revenue calculation.

We intend to regularly review and evaluate the design and
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and
internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis
and to improve these controls and procedures over time and to
correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future.
While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls
and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting
are effective, future events affecting our business may cause us
to modify our these controls and procedures in the future.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework).
Based on our evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2004.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included herein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

December 31, 2004

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group or the Company) and its
subsidiaries, the principal subsidiaries being Alaska Airlines,
Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. These financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and their preparation requires the use
of management’s estimates. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

Nature of Operations

Alaska and Horizon operate as airlines. However, their business
plans, competition, and economic risks differ substantially.
Alaska is a major airline serving primarily Alaska; the
U.S. West Coast; Chicago, Denver, five cities on the
U.S. East Coast; Vancouver, Canada; and Mexico. It operates
an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is
996 miles. Horizon is a regional airline serving primarily
the Pacific Northwest, Northern California, and Western Canada.
It operates both jet and turboprop aircraft, and its average
passenger trip is 363 miles.

On January 1, 2004, Horizon began operating regional jet
service branded as Frontier JetExpress under a 12-year agreement
with Frontier Airlines. Service under this agreement became
fully operational during the second quarter of 2004 and Horizon
is currently operating nine regional jet aircraft under the
Frontier JetExpress brand. Flying under this agreement
represented 21.4% of Horizon’s 2004 capacity and 9.1% of
passenger revenues.

The Company’s operations and financial results are subject
to various uncertainties, such as industry instability, general
economic conditions, intense competition and the actions of
competing airlines, volatile fuel prices, a largely unionized
work force at Alaska, the need to finance large capital
expenditures, government regulation, and potential aircraft
incidents.

The airlines are characterized by high fixed costs. Small
fluctuations in load factors and yield can have a significant
impact on operating results. The Company has reported a
consolidated net operating loss each year since 2001 and is
working to reduce unit costs to better compete with carriers
that have lower cost structures.

Substantially all of Alaska’s and Horizon’s sales
occur in the United States. See Note 12 for operating
segment information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less. They are carried at
cost, which approximates market. The Company reduces cash
balances when checks are disbursed. Due to the time delay in
checks clearing the banks, the Company normally maintains a
negative cash balance, which is reported as a current liability.
The amount of the negative cash balance was $29.1 million
and $27.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and is included in accounts payable.

Receivables

Receivables consist primarily of airline traffic (including
credit card) receivables, amounts from customers, mileage plan
partners, government tax authorities, and other miscellaneous
amounts due to the Company, and are net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts of $3.0 million at December 31, 2004
and



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

$1.7 million at December 31, 2003. Management
determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on known
troubled accounts and historical experience applied to an aging
of accounts.

Inventories and Supplies — net

Expendable aircraft parts, materials and supplies are stated at
average cost and are included in inventories and supplies-net.
An obsolescence allowance for flight equipment expendable parts
is accrued based on estimated disposal dates and salvage values.
Surplus inventories are carried at their net realizable value.
The allowance for all non-surplus expendable inventories was
$18.9 million and $18.0 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Inventory and supplies-net also
includes fuel inventory of $4.1 million and
$2.9 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Repairable and Rotable aircraft parts inventory
are included in flight equipment.

Property, Equipment and Depreciation

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives, which are as follows:

*

As a result of our announced intent to retire the B737-200C
    fleet, all aircraft and related flight equipment are being
    depreciated through 2007.

Flight equipment includes repairable inventory parts, net of an
obsolescence allowance. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
this allowance totaled $18.4 million and
$17.3 million, respectively.

Routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. The
costs of major airframe and engine overhauls are capitalized and
amortized to maintenance expense over the shorter of the life of
the overhaul or the remaining lease term. However, effective
January 1, 2005, the Company plans to change the way it
accounts for airframe and engine overhauls. Under the new
policy, those activities will be expensed as incurred. This
change will result in a cumulative impact of accounting change
totaling approximately $91 million, after tax, in the first
quarter of 2005. Major modifications that extend the life or
improve the usefulness of aircraft are capitalized and
depreciated over their estimated period of use. Assets and
related obligations for items financed under capital leases are
initially recorded at an amount equal to the present value of
the future minimum lease payments.

The Company evaluates long-lived assets to be held and used for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the total carrying amount of an asset or asset group may
not be recoverable. The Company groups assets for purposes of
such reviews at the lowest level for which identifiable cash
flows of the asset group are largely independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. An impairment
loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use of the asset

or asset group and its eventual disposition are less than its
carrying amount. If the asset or asset group is not considered
recoverable, a write-down equal to the excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value will be recorded.

Internally-Used Software Costs

The Company capitalizes costs to develop internal-use software
that are incurred in the application development stage.
Amortization commences when the software is ready for its
intended use and the amortization period is the estimated useful
life of the software, generally three to five years. Capitalized
costs primarily include contract labor and payroll costs of the
individuals dedicated to the development of internal use
software. The Company capitalized software development costs of
$6.8 million, $3.2 million and $6.9 million
during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively.

Workers Compensation and Employee Health Care Accruals

The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance
mechanisms to provide for workers’ compensation claims and
employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the
risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and
are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims
experience and outside expertise, severity factors and other
actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these
liabilities could be significantly affected if future
occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and
historical trends.

Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue results primarily from the sale of mileage
credits, the sale and leaseback of aircraft, and the receipt of
manufacturer or vendor credits. This revenue is recognized when
award transportation is provided or over the term of the
applicable agreements.

Leased Aircraft Return Costs

Cash payments associated with returning leased aircraft are
accrued beginning immediately after the last heavy maintenance
visit prior to the scheduled aircraft return date based on the
time remaining on the lease, planned aircraft usage and the
provisions included in the lease agreement, although the actual
amount due to any lessor upon return will not be known with
certainty until the end of the lease.

As leased aircraft are returned, any payments are charged
against the established accrual. The accrual is part of other
current and long-term liabilities, and was $6.9 million and
$14.2 million as of December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Passenger revenue is recognized when the passenger travels.
Tickets sold but not yet used are reported as air traffic
liability. Passenger traffic commissions and related fees are
expensed when the related revenue is recognized. Passenger
traffic commissions and related fees not yet recognized are
included as a prepaid expense. Due to complex pricing
structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline
agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized
in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the
revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized.
These estimates are generally based on the statistical analysis
of the Company’s historical data. Any adjustments resulting
from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability
are included in results of operations during the period in which
the evaluations are completed. Historically, any such
adjustments have not been significant.

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

Freight and mail revenues are recognized when service is
provided. Other-net revenues are primarily related to the
Mileage Plan and they are recognized as described in the
“Frequent Flyer Awards” paragraph below.

Frequent Flyer Awards

Alaska operates a frequent flyer program (“Mileage
Plan”) that provides travel awards to members based on
accumulated mileage. For miles earned by flying on Alaska and
through airline partners, the estimated incremental cost of
providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense
and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated. Alaska also
sells mileage credits to non-airline partners such as hotels,
car rental agencies, and a major bank that offers Alaska
Airlines affinity credit cards. The Company defers the portion
of the sales proceeds that represents the estimated fair value
of the award transportation and recognizes that amount as
revenue when the award transportation is provided. The deferred
proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards redeemed
on Alaska or Horizon, and as other-net revenue for awards
redeemed on other airlines. Alaska’s Mileage Plan deferred
revenue and liabilities are included under the following balance

mileage plan awards issued but not yet flown.

Contracted Services

Contracted services includes expenses for ground handling,
security, navigation fees, temporary employees, data processing
fees, and other similar services.

Other Selling Expenses and Commissions

Other selling expenses and commissions include credit card
commissions, global distribution systems charges, Mileage Plan
free travel awards, advertising, promotional costs, commissions
and incentives. Advertising production costs are expensed the
first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense was
$16.7 million in both 2004 and 2003 and $17.0 million
in 2002.

Capitalized Interest

Interest is capitalized on flight equipment purchase deposits
and ground facility progress payments as a cost of the related
asset. The interest cost is based on the Company’s weighted
average borrowing rate and is depreciated over the estimated
useful life of the asset. The Company ceases capitalization of
interest on aircraft when delivery dates are deferred.
Capitalization continues when the deferral period is over.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the asset and liability approach for accounting
and reporting income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is established, if
necessary, for the amount of any tax benefits that, based on
available evidence, are not expected to be realized.

Stock Options

The Company applies the intrinsic value method in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees”, and related Interpretations in
accounting for stock options. See Note 6 for more
information.

The following table represents the pro forma net income (loss)
before accounting change and pro forma earnings (loss) per share
(EPS) had compensation cost for the Company’s stock
options been determined in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123. In
accordance with SFAS No. 123, the fair value of each
stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model and then amortized ratably
over the vesting period. The following assumptions were used for
grants in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively: dividend yield of
0% for all years; volatility of 37%, 43%, and 49%; risk-free
interest rates of 3.43%, 2.97%, and 3.82%; and expected lives of
5 years for all years. Using these assumptions, the
weighted average fair value of options granted was $11.73,
$8.96, and $13.43 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS 123R, “Share Based
Payments: An Amendment of FASB No. 123 and 95”. The
new standard requires companies to recognize in the income
statement the grant-date fair value of stock options and other
equity based compensation issued to employees. This new standard
will apply to both stock options that the Company



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

grants to employees and to the Company’s Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, which features a look-back provision and allows
employees to purchase stock at a discount in excess of 5%. The
Company’s options are typically granted with graded vesting
provisions, and the Company intends to amortize compensation
cost over the service period using the straight-line method.
This new statement is effective for interim or annual periods
beginning after June  15, 2005 (the Company’s
third quarter of 2005). The Company intends to use the
“modified prospective method” upon adoption whereby
unvested equity awards are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS 123 but amounts are recognized in the income statement
instead. The Company’s stock based compensation expense, as
measured under SFAS 123, approximates $8 to
$10 million per year on a pre-tax basis.

New Accounting Standards

During the third quarter of 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) affirmed its tentative conclusion reached in July of
2004 on EITF Issue No. 04-08, “The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted EPS” (EITF 04-08).
EITF 04-08 requires companies to include certain
contingently convertible securities in the calculation of
diluted EPS to the extent the inclusion of the shares would not
be anti-dilutive beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Because the Company’s convertible notes fall under the
scope of EITF 04-08, the Company expects to report a lower
diluted EPS to the extent the convertible notes are not
anti-dilutive. The notes were anti-dilutive for the full year of
2004 and the full year of 2003.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.”
FIN 46, as amended by FIN 46 (Revised) in December
2003, requires consolidation of certain types of entities in
which the Company absorbs a majority of the entity’s
expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s
expected returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual
or other financial interests in the entity. These entities are
called “variable interest entities.” The principal
characteristics of variable interest entities are (1) an
insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity’s
expected losses, (2) equity owners as a group are not able
to make decisions about the entity’s activities, and
(3) equity that does not absorb the entity’s losses or
receive the entity’s residual returns. Variable interests
are contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in an
entity that change with fluctuations in the entity’s net
asset value. As a result, variable interest entities can arise
from items such as lease agreements, loan arrangements,
guarantees or service contracts.

If an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the
entity must be consolidated by the “primary
beneficiary”. The primary beneficiary is the holder of the
variable interests that absorbs a majority of the variable
interest entity’s expected losses or receives a majority of
the entity’s residual returns in the event no holder has a
majority of the expected losses. There is no primary beneficiary
in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the
expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns.
The determination of the primary beneficiary is based on
qualitative aspects of the arrangements involved or projected
cash flows at the inception of the transaction with the variable
interests entity.

FIN 46 is applicable to financial statements of companies
that have interests in “special purpose entities”, as
defined, beginning with the year ended 2003.

The Company is the lessee in a series of operating leases
covering our leased aircraft. In many instances, the lessors are
trusts established by a third party specifically to purchase,
finance and lease aircraft to the Company. These leasing
entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities.
However, they do not meet the consolidation requirements of
FIN 46 because the Company is not the primary beneficiary
of the entity’s expected gains or losses. The
Company’s conclusions are based on the fact that the
leasing arrangements involved contain terms which are consistent
with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not
include residual value guarantees made by the Company,
fixed-price purchase obligations or similar features that
obligate the Company to absorb the majority of expected losses
of the variable interest entities. The Company’s maximum
exposure under these types of lease arrangements is the
remaining lease payments,

which are reflected in future lease commitments in Note 5
(plus the cost, if any, of bringing the equipment into
compliance with the physical condition required for return).

As discussed in “Property, Equipment and
Depreciation,” the Company currently capitalizes costs
related to major airframe and engine overhauls and amortizes
those costs to maintenance expense over the shorter of the life
of the overhaul or the remaining lease term.

Fourth Quarter Adjustments

Operating loss for the three months ended December 31, 2004
includes the following items:

•

A charge of $25.9 million related to our restructuring
    initiatives announced earlier in 2004. The total charge for 2004
    was $53.4 million.

•

A $23.1 million mark-to-market loss on fuel hedges related
    to future fuel consumption. For the year ended December 31,
    2004, total mark-to-market gain related to future hedges was
    $56.9 million (pre-tax).

•

An impairment charge of $0.6 million related to
    Horizon’s retired F-28 fleet.

Operating loss for the three months and year ended
December 31, 2003 includes adjustments to increase
operating expenses by $2.8 million (pre-tax) related to
prior years. Operating loss for the three months ended
December 31, 2003 also includes adjustments to increase
operating expenses by $1.8 million (pre-tax) and increase
operating revenues by $6.3 million (pre-tax), both related
to previous quarters in 2003. Management does not believe that
these amounts are material to the periods affected.

During 2004, Alaska issued $94.6 million of debt secured by
flight equipment, having interest rates that vary with LIBOR and
payment terms ranging from 12 to 16 years. Debt issuances
during the period were offset by normal long-term debt payments
of $59.9 million and full repayment of the Company’s
credit facility of $150.0 million.

During 2004, Horizon financed three Bombardier Q400s under
long-term debt arrangements totaling $44.7 million. These
debt arrangements have a 15-year term and interest rates that
vary with LIBOR. Two of the aircraft were originally leased in
January 2004 and were treated as capital leases at that time.
The resulting re-financing transactions did not result in any
gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.

On March 21, 2003, the Company completed the private
placement of $150.0 million of floating rate senior
convertible notes due in 2023 (the Notes). The Notes bear
interest for the first five years from date of issuance at a
variable interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 2.5% (5.06% at
December 31, 2004). This interest is paid quarterly in
arrears. Thereafter, the Notes will cease bearing cash interest
and instead, the principal value of the Notes will increase
daily by the unpaid interest, which will be calculated at LIBOR
plus 2.5%, up to a maximum of 5.25%.

The Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s
common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to the
original or variable principal, divided by 38.4615. At date of
issuance, the conversion price was equal to $26.00 per
share, which would result in an additional 5,769,000 shares
of common stock. Holders



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

may not surrender the notes for conversion into shares of the
Company’s common stock (or cash, at the election of the
Company) unless the closing sale price of the Company’s
common stock exceeds 110% of the accreted conversion price under
the Notes for 20 days in the 30 trading-day period ending
on the last day of the fiscal quarter. Upon conversion, the
Company may deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a
combination of cash and common stock. The Company may redeem all
or a portion of the Notes in cash or common stock or a
combination of cash and common stock at any time on or after the
third anniversary of the issuance of the Notes. In addition,
holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of
their Notes on the 5th, 10th and 15th anniversaries of the
issuance of the Notes or upon the occurrence of a change of
control or tax event at principal plus accrued interest.

On September 30, 2004, we entered into the First
Supplemental Indenture with respect to the Notes to rescind the
Company’s right to pay for such a repurchase of the Notes
at the option of the holders, in whole or in part, in shares of
our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the notes, as
amended, any such repurchases shall be paid for in cash.

For each $1,000 of original principal amount per Note, the
conversion price through March 21, 2008 is equal to the
original principal amount of the Notes, divided by 38.4615. At
the date of issuance, the conversion price was equal to
$26.00 per share and the conversion trigger price was equal
to 110% of the conversion price, or $28.60 per share. After
March 21, 2008, the conversion price and conversion trigger
price increase based on the variable yield of the notes. Once
the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock
exceeds the conversion trigger price for the requisite period,
the notes will be convertible at any time thereafter at the
option of the holder, through maturity.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with
the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured
indebtedness. The Notes do not restrict the ability of the
Company’s subsidiaries to enter into additional agreements
limiting or prohibiting the distribution of earnings, loans or
other payments to Air Group.

During 2003, the Company made a capital contribution to Alaska
Airlines of the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the
notes. Alaska Airlines expects to use the remaining proceeds
from the notes for working capital requirements and expects in
the future to continue to use these remaining proceeds for
working capital requirements such as fuel, rent, maintenance or
payroll costs as well as other general corporate purposes, which
would include the acquisition of aircraft and other capital
assets, repayment of debt, or maintenance of desired cash
balances as well as other general corporate purposes. Although
the Company has not yet determined how each payment of principal
or interest due will be funded in the future, the Company
anticipates that these payments will be funded either by
dividends, distributions, loans, advances or other payments from
our subsidiaries or through new borrowings or financings by
Alaska Air Group. Any such payments by the Company’s
subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual
restrictions.

Bank Line of Credit

The Company had a $150 million credit facility that expired
in December 2004. This facility contained contractual
restrictions required maintenance of specific levels of net
worth, maintenance of certain debt and leases to net worth,
leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios, and limits on
investments, lease obligations, sales of assets, and additional
indebtedness. Such provisions also limited the amount of funds
Alaska Airlines can distribute via dividend to Alaska Air Group.
The notes did not restrict the ability of the Company’s
subsidiaries to enter into additional agreements limiting or
prohibiting the distribution of earnings, loans or other
payments to Alaska Air Group. The Company is currently
negotiating a replacement facility and hopes to have that
agreement completed by the end of the first quarter, although
there can be no assurance that this can be accomplished on
acceptable terms to the Company. The Company expects that the
new line of credit facility will be at least as restrictive as
the prior credit facility.

Commitments

Lease Commitments

At December 31, 2004, the Company had lease contracts for
110 aircraft that have remaining noncancelable lease terms of
one to 16 years. The majority of airport and terminal
facilities are also leased. Total rent expense was
$309.6 million, $288.1 million and
$274.1 million, in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Future minimum lease payments with noncancelable terms in excess
of one year as of December 31, 2004 are shown below (in

Aircraft Commitments

At December 31, 2004, the Company had firm purchase
commitments for 12 aircraft requiring aggregate payments of
approximately $291.1 million. In addition, Alaska had
options to acquire 26 additional B737’s, and Horizon had
options to acquire 15 Q400’s and 25 CRJ 700’s. Alaska
and Horizon expect to finance the firm orders and, to the extent
exercised, the option aircraft with leases, long-term debt or
internally generated cash.

In February 2005, the Company converted options to acquire three
B737-800 aircraft into firm orders to be delivered in 2006. This
results in additional purchase commitments.

Note 6.

Stock Plans

The Company has awards outstanding under a number of long-term
incentive equity plans, one of which continues to provide for
the grant of stock options to purchase Air Group common stock at
market prices on the date of the grant to directors, officers
and employees of Air Group and its subsidiaries. Under the
various plans, options for 4,562,950 shares have been
granted and, at December 31, 2004, 1,729,415 shares
were available for grant. Under all plans, the stock options
granted have terms of up to ten years. Substantially all
grantees are 25% vested after one year, 50% after two years, 75%
after three years, and 100% after four years.

The Company follows the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB
Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in accounting
for stock options. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for these plans as the exercise price of options
equals the fair market value on date of grant.

Restricted Stock Awards

In November 2004, the Company awarded approximately 125,000
restricted stock units (RSUs) to certain executives at Alaska
and Horizon. The RSUs are non-voting, and are not eligible for
dividends. The RSUs “cliff vest” after 3 years.
The Company recognized $3.5 million as deferred stock-based
compensation, reflecting the value of the total RSU award at the
grant date based on the closing price of our common stock.
Amortization of deferred stock-based compensation was
$0.1 million in 2004 and is included in wages and benefits
on the consolidation statements of operations.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company sponsors an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP
Plan) that is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the terms of the ESPP Plan,
employees can purchase Company common stock at 85% of the lower
of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each
quarterly offering period. Proceeds received from the issuance
of shares are credited to stockholders’ equity in the
period in which the shares are issued. In 2004 and 2003,
137,456 shares and 135,043 shares, respectively, were
purchased by Company employees under the ESPP Plan.

Employee Benefit Plans

Four defined benefit and five defined contribution retirement

Discount rates of 5.75%
and 6.00% were used as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. For both years, the rate of compensation increase
used varied from 3.47% to 6.80% depending on the plan.

Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic
benefit cost as of December 31:

Discount rates of 6.00%
and 6.75% were used as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. For both years, the expected return on plan assets
used was 8.0% and the rate of compensation increase used varied
from 3.47% to 6.80% depending on the plan.

In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company
assesses the current level of expected returns on risk free
investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level
of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in
which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future
returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset
class is then weighted based on the target asset allocation to
develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
assumption for the portfolio.

The asset allocation of the defined benefit plans, by asset
category, is as follows as of the end of 2004 and 2003:

The Company’s investment policy focuses on achieving
maximum returns at a reasonable risk for pension assets over a
full market cycle. The Company uses a number of fund managers
and invests in various asset classes to diversify risk. Target
allocations for the primary asset classes are approximately:

Domestic equities:


%

Non-U.S. equities:


%

Fixed income:


%

Pension assets are rebalanced periodically to maintain the above
target asset allocations. An individual equity investment will
not exceed 10% of the entire equity portfolio. Fixed income
securities carry a minimum “A” rating by Moody’s
and/or Standard and Poor’s and the average life of the bond
portfolio may not exceed 10 years. The Company does not
currently have the intent to invest plan assets in the
Company’s common stock.

In 2002, the Company recorded an $87.2 million (net of
taxes of $52.5 million) non-cash charge to equity in
connection with the defined benefit plans that the Company
sponsors for eligible employees. This charge resulted from an
unfunded accrued benefit obligation resulting from lower than
expected returns on plan assets and a reduction in discount
rate. In 2003, the Company recorded a reduction of this equity
charge of $5.2 million (net of taxes of $3.3 million)
primarily reflecting higher than expected return on assets. In
2004, the Company recorded a $2.3 million (net of taxes of
$1.2 million) non-cash charge to equity in connection with
the defined benefit plans that the Company sponsors for eligible
employees.

The Company expects to contribute $57.8 million to these

Defined Contribution Plans

The defined contribution plans are deferred compensation plans
under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. All of
these plans require Company contributions. Total expense for the
defined contribution plans was $23.2 million,
$21.7 million, and $20.6 million, respectively, in
2004, 2003, and 2002.

Profit Sharing Plans

Alaska and Horizon have employee profit sharing plans. In 2004,
the Company recorded profit sharing expense of $1.6 million
($1.2 million Alaska and $0.4 million Horizon). In
2003, the Company recorded profit sharing expense of
$3.7 million ($2.9 million Alaska and
$0.8 million Horizon). In January 2005, the Company
introduced a new reward program for all employees that entitles
employees to quarterly payouts of up to $300 per person if
operational and customer service objectives are met. Based on
expected headcount, the total payout could be as high as
$16 million if all objectives are met. The profit sharing
participation percentage was also reduced from its 2004 level.

Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company allows retirees to continue their medical, dental,
and vision benefits by paying all or a portion of the active
employee plan premium until eligible for Medicare, currently
age 65. This results in a subsidy to retirees, because the
premiums received by the Company are less than the actual cost
of the retirees’ claims. The accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation (APBO) for this subsidy is unfunded, and
at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $76.2 million and
$77.3 million, respectively. This liability was determined
using an assumed discount rate of 5.75% and 6.00% in 2004 and
2003, respectively. The accrued liability related to the subsidy
is included within other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, and totaled $47.2 million and $39.2 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Annual expense
related to this subsidy was approximately $9.3 million in
2004, $9.6 million in 2003, and $4.4 million in 2002.

The Company uses a December 31 measurement date to assess
obligations associated with the subsidy. Net periodic benefit

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts
for tax purposes.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

Deferred tax (assets) and liabilities comprise the
following at December 31 (in millions):

*

Federal loss carryforwards of $59.2 million
    ($20.7 million tax effected) expire beginning in 2023 and
    ending in 2024. State loss carryforwards of $100.0 million
    ($4.4 million tax effected) expire beginning in 2005 and
    ending in 2024.

The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that
its deferred tax assets would be realizable and thus no
valuation allowance has been recorded as of December 31,
2004. This conclusion is based on the expected future reversals
of existing taxable temporary differences and does not rely on
future taxable income. Should the Company incur additional
losses in the future, the Company’s ability to realize the
net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to greater
uncertainty. The Company will continue to reassess the need for
a valuation allowance during each future reporting period.

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

Concentrations of Credit

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and the
credit quality of, the financial institutions that are
counterparties to its derivative financial instruments and does
not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company could realize a material loss in the event of
nonperformance by any single counterparty to its fuel hedge
positions. However, the Company enters into transactions only
with large, well-known financial institution counterparties that
have strong credit ratings. In addition, the Company limits the
amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.

The Company’s trade receivables do not represent a
significant concentration of credit risk at December 31,
2004 due to the frequency that settlement takes place and the
dispersion across many industry and government segments.

Note 10.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company records all derivative instruments on the balance
sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedging
instrument and the effectiveness of the hedges.

The Company’s operations are inherently dependent upon the
price and availability of aircraft fuel, which accounted for 20%
and 15% of 2004 and 2003 operating expenses (excluding
impairment and restructuring charges), respectively. To manage
economic risks associated with fluctuations in aircraft fuel
prices, the Company enters into swap agreements and call options
for crude oil. Prior to the second quarter of 2004, these
hedging contracts were “highly correlated” to changes
in aircraft fuel prices, and therefore qualified as “cash
flow hedges” under SFAS No. 133 whereby the
majority of the changes in fair value were deferred in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on the Company’s
Balance Sheet until these hedge positions were settled at which
point they were recognized in earnings.

The Company’s current fuel hedge program includes the same
underlying commodities used historically. However, because of
variations in the spread between the prices of West Texas
Intermediate crude oil and jet fuel since April 1, 2004,
the Company’s hedge contracts are no longer “highly
correlated” to changes in prices of aircraft fuel, as
defined in SFAS No. 133. The impacts on the
Company’s reported results are as follows:

•

All changes in the fair value of fuel hedge contracts that
    existed as of March 31, 2004 or hedge positions entered
    into subsequent to March 31, 2004 (the end of the first
    quarter of 2004) are reported in other non-operating income
    (expense).

•

Because the Company will be recording fair value changes in its
    consolidated statement of operations as they occur (in
    non-operating income (expense)), actual gains or losses realized
    upon settlement of the hedge contracts entered into subsequent
    to March 31, 2004 will not be reflected in fuel expense.

•

Reported fuel expense will include the effective portion of
    gains associated with hedge positions that settled during the
    current period on contracts that existed at March 31, 2004
    to the extent that mark-to-market gains were already included in
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss at March 31, 2004.

Earnings (Loss) per Share (EPS)

Earnings (loss) per share (EPS) calculations were as
follows (in millions except per share amounts):

Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the average
common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that
would have been outstanding assuming the exercise of
in-the-money stock options, using the treasury stock method.
Stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS
because they are antidilutive, represented 3.7 million,
3.0 million and 3.3 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

During the third quarter of 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) affirmed its tentative conclusion reached in July of
2004 on EITF Issue No. 04-08, “The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted EPS” (EITF 04-08).
EITF 04-08 requires companies to include certain
contingently convertible securities in the calculation of
diluted EPS to the extent the inclusion of the shares would not
be anti-dilutive beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004 with
retroactive application required. Because the Company’s
convertible notes (which would convert to 5,769,000 shares
of common stock) fall under the scope of EITF 04-08 , the
Company expects to report a lower diluted EPS to the extent the
convertible notes are not anti-dilutive. The notes were
anti-dilutive for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Note 12.

Operating Segment Information

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an

Charges

Impairment of 737-200C Aircraft

In June 2004, the Company’s Board approved a plan to
accelerate the retirement of Alaska’s Boeing 737-200C fleet
and remove those aircraft from service (by the end of 2007)
earlier than initially planned. In July 2004, the Company
announced its plan to replace these aircraft by modifying five
existing 737-400 aircraft and using other existing 737-400
aircraft for the remaining passenger capacity. Four of the five
modified airplanes will be converted into combination
passenger/cargo aircraft and one will be converted to an all
cargo aircraft. The Company expects to backfill the 737-400s
with Boeing 737-800s to be delivered in 2005 and 2006.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

As a result of this decision, the Company evaluated impairment
as required by SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” and concluded
that the carrying value of the 737-200C fleet was no longer
recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash
flows. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2004, Alaska
recorded an impairment charge totaling $36.8 million
(pre-tax) to write down the fleet to its estimated fair market
value.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s aircraft was
derived using third-party appraisals and market data compiled by
an independent pricing authority, and adjusted for other factors
that management deemed appropriate. In conjunction with the fair
value determination, the Company has reassessed the useful lives
and residual values of the fleet and related spare equipment and
will depreciate the remaining carrying values through 2007 when
the last aircraft will be retired.

Impairment of F-28 Aircraft and Related Spare Engines

During the first, second and fourth quarters of 2004, Horizon
recorded impairment charges of $2.4 million,
$0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively,
associated with its held-for-sale F-28 aircraft and spare
engines to lower the carrying value of these assets to their
estimated net realizable value based on recent offers and/or
letters of intent from prospective buyers.

Note 14.

Restructuring Charges

During the third quarter of 2004, Alaska announced a management
reorganization and the closure of its Oakland heavy maintenance
base, contracting out of the Company’s Fleet Service and
Ground Support Equipment maintenance functions and other
initiatives. In total, these restructuring activities will
result in a reduction of approximately 900 employees when fully
implemented in 2005. Severance and related costs associated with
this restructuring are estimated at $53.4 million, of which
$27.5 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2004
and $25.9 million was recorded in the fourth quarter. The
severance package offered to impacted employees included cash
payments based on years of service and one year of medical
coverage after severance date. Since Alaska self-insures for
employee medical coverage, the Company estimated the projected
claims cost for affected employees and recorded a corresponding
accrual. Actual experience will likely differ from the estimate
if employees accept positions with other employers and no longer
need the coverage provided by Alaska or simply submit claims
during the one year period that are higher or lower than our
estimate. The Company expects to adjust this accrual quarterly
throughout 2005.

The following table displays the activity and balances of the
restructuring charges for year ended December 31, 2004.
There were no restructuring charges during the same period of
2003 ($ in millions):

Note 15.     Contingencies

The Company is a party to routine commercial and employment
litigation incidental to its business and with respect to which
no material liability is expected. Management believes the
ultimate disposition of these matters is not likely to
materially affect the Company’s financial position or
results of operations. However,



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

this belief is based on management’s current understanding
of the relevant law and facts; it is subject to various
contingencies, including the potential costs and risks
associated with litigation and the actions of judges and juries.

The Company’s existing pilot contract provides that, if a
negotiated agreement on the entire contract was not reached by
December 15, 2004, ten contract issues plus wage rates
would be submitted to an interest arbitrator. Issues submitted
generally relate to pension plans, medical insurance, profit
sharing, code sharing and work rules. The parties did not reach
an agreement, and the issues have been submitted to binding
arbitration in March 2005 with a decision to be effective in May
2005. The pilot labor contract contains market related standards
for wages and non-wage issues.

The Company could potentially be responsible for environmental
remediation costs primarily related to jet fuel and other
petroleum contamination that occurs in the normal course of
business at various locations in the Company’s system. The
Company has established an accrual for estimated remediation
costs for known contamination based on information currently
available. The accrual was not significant at December 31,
2004 or 2003.

security fees remitted and carrier fees paid to the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) since its
inception in February 2002. Additionally, passenger security
fees were not imposed by the TSA and carrier fees were not paid
during the period June 1, 2003 through September 30,
2003. In May 2003, the Company received its share of the
one-time cash grant in the amount of $71.4 million
($52.8 million for Alaska and $18.6 million for
Horizon).

In August 2003, the Company received $2.7 million
($2.5 million for Alaska and $0.2 million for Horizon)
from the Federal Aviation Administration in reimbursement of
flight deck reinforcement expenditures. The reimbursement was
recorded as an offset to capital costs.

Note 17.

Change in Accounting Principle

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Under this
statement, goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and
is no longer amortized but instead is subject to periodic
impairment testing. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 142. Assuming the Company had adopted
this standard as of January 1, 2001, the Company’s net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2001 would have been
reduced by approximately $2.0 million ($.08 per share)
for the impact of goodwill amortization.

During the second quarter of 2002, the Company completed the
first step of its impairment test related to its
$51.4 million of goodwill and determined that the net book
value exceeded its fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2002,
the Company completed the second step of its impairment test and
determined that all of the Company’s goodwill was impaired.
As a result, the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge,
effective January 1, 2002 of $51.4 million
($12.5 million Alaska and $38.9 million Horizon) to
write-off all of its goodwill. This charge is reflected as a
cumulative effect of accounting change in the 2002 consolidated
statement of operations.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Alaska Air Group, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Alaska Air Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then
ended. In connection with our audit of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited financial statement
schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Alaska Air Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2004,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the

over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Alaska Air Group, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Alaska Air Group, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Alaska Air Group, Inc.’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of Alaska Air Group, Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Alaska Air
Group, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Also, in our opinion, Alaska Air Group, Inc. maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
