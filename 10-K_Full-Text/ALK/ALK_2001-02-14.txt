PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL INFORMATION

Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group or the Company) is a holding company that was incorporated in Delaware in 1985. Its two principal subsidiaries are
Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Both subsidiaries operate as airlines, although their business plans, competition and economic risks differ
substantially. Alaska is a major airline, operates an all-jet fleet, and its average passenger trip length is 886 miles. Horizon is a regional airline, operates jet and turboprop aircraft,
and its average passenger trip is 283 miles. Individual financial information for Alaska and Horizon is reported in Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Air Group's executive offices
are located at 19300 Pacific Highway South, Seattle, Washington 98188. The business of the Company is somewhat seasonal. Quarterly operating income tends to peak during the third quarter.

Alaska

Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937. Alaska serves 37 cities in seven states (Alaska, Washington,
Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona and Illinois), one city in Canada and five cities in Mexico. In each year since 1973, Alaska has carried more passengers between Alaska and the U.S. mainland than
any other airline. In 2000, Alaska carried 13.5 million revenue passengers. Passenger traffic within Alaska and between Alaska and the U.S. mainland accounted for 24% of Alaska's 2000 revenue
passenger miles, West Coast traffic (including Vancouver, Canada) accounted for 66% and the Mexico markets 10%. Based on passenger enplanements, Alaska's leading airports are Seattle, Portland, Los
Angeles and Anchorage. Based on revenues, its leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Anchorage, Seattle-Los Angeles and Seattle-San Diego. At December 31, 2000, Alaska's
operating fleet consisted of 95 jet aircraft.

Horizon

Horizon, a Washington corporation, began service in 1981 and was acquired by Air Group in 1986. It is the largest regional airline in the Pacific Northwest,
and serves 35 cities in five states (Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and California) and five cities in Canada. In 2000, Horizon carried 5.0 million revenue passengers. Based on passenger
enplanements, Horizon's leading airports are Seattle, Portland, Boise and Spokane. Based on revenues, its leading nonstop routes are Seattle-Portland, Seattle-Vancouver and Seattle-Spokane. At
December 31, 2000, Horizon's operating fleet consisted of 22 jet and 40 turboprop aircraft, with the jets providing 63% of the 2000 capacity. Horizon flights are listed under the Alaska
Airlines designator code in airline computer reservation systems.

Alaska
and Horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide the best possible service between any two points served by their systems. In 2000, nearly 26% of Horizon's passengers
connected to Alaska. Both airlines distinguish themselves from competitors by providing a higher level of customer service. The airlines' excellent service in the form of advance seat assignments,
expedited check-in, attention to customer needs, high-quality food and beverage service, well-maintained aircraft, a first-class section aboard Alaska aircraft and
other amenities is regularly recognized by independent studies and surveys of air travelers.

Alliances with Other Airlines

Alaska and Horizon have marketing alliances with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage accrual and redemption privileges and
codesharing on certain flights as set forth below. Alliances enhance Alaska's and Horizon's revenues by (a) providing our customers more value by


offering them more travel destinations and better mileage accrual/redemption opportunities, (b) gaining access to more connecting traffic from other airlines, and (c) providing members
of alliance partners'
frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska and Horizon while earning mileage credit in the alliance partners' program.

BUSINESS RISKS

The Company's operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties, such as intense competition, volatile fuel prices, a largely unionized
labor force, the need to finance large capital expenditures, government regulation, potential aircraft incidents and general economic conditions. This report may contain forward-looking statements
that are based on the best information currently available to management. The forward-looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are indicated by phrases such as "the Company believes", "we anticipate" or any
other language indicating a prediction of future events. Whether these statements are ultimately accurate depends on a number of outside factors that the Company cannot predict or control. The Company
undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. The following discussion of business risks sets forth the principal foreseeable risks and uncertainties that may materially
affect these predictions.

Competition

Competition in the air transportation industry is intense. Any domestic air carrier deemed fit by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) is
allowed to operate scheduled passenger service in the United States. Together, Alaska and Horizon carry 2.5% of all U.S. domestic passenger traffic. Alaska and Horizon compete with one or more
domestic or foreign airlines on most of their routes. Some of these competitors are substantially larger than Alaska and Horizon, have greater financial resources and have more extensive route
systems. Due to its shorthaul markets, Horizon also competes with the automobile.


Most major U.S. carriers have developed, independently or in partnership with others, large computerized reservation systems (CRS). Airlines, including Alaska and Horizon, are charged
industry-set fees to have their flight schedules included in the various CRS displays used by travel agents and airlines. These systems are currently the predominant means of distributing
airline tickets. In order to reduce anti-competitive practices, the DOT regulates the display of all airline schedules and fares. Air carriers are increasingly distributing their services
on the Internet through various airline joint venture or independent websites. The Company cannot predict the terms on which it may be able to participate in these sites, or their effect on the
Company's ability to compete with other airlines.

Fuel

Fuel costs were 17.4% of the Company's total operating expenses in 2000. Fuel prices, which can be volatile and are largely outside of the Company's control,
can have a significant impact on the Company's operating results. Currently, a one-cent change in the fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately $3.7 million.
The Company believes that operating fuel-efficient aircraft is an effective hedge against high fuel prices. During 2000, the Company resumed hedging against its exposure to fluctuations in
the price of jet fuel.

Unionized Labor Force

Labor costs were 33% of the Company's total operating expenses in 2000. Wage rates can have a significant impact on the Company's operating results. At
December 31, 2000, labor unions represented 84% of Alaska's and 45% of Horizon's employees. The air transportation industry is regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National
Mediation Board certain regulatory powers with
respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions. The Company cannot predict the outcome of union contract negotiations or whether the terms of its labor contracts will hinder its ability to
compete effectively. Nor can the Company control the variety of actions (e.g. work stoppage or slowdown) unions might take to try to influence those negotiations.

Leverage and Future Capital Requirements

The Company, like many airlines, is relatively highly leveraged, which increases the volatility of its earnings. Due to its high fixed costs, including
aircraft lease commitments, a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings. In addition, the Company has an ongoing need to finance new aircraft deliveries and
there is no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms. See Item 7 for management's discussion of liquidity and capital resources.

Government Regulation; International Routes

Like other airlines, the Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the DOT. The FAA, under its mandate to ensure
aviation safety, can ground aircraft, suspend or revoke the authority of an air carrier or its licensed personnel for failure to comply with Federal Aviation Regulations, and levy civil penalties. The
Company also depends on the efficient operation of the air traffic control system to ensure reliability of its own operations. The DOT has the authority to regulate certain airline economic functions
including financial and statistical reporting, consumer protection, computerized reservations systems, essential air transportation and international route authority. The Company is subject to
bilateral agreements between the United States and the foreign countries to which the Company provides service. There can be no assurance that existing bilateral agreements between the United States
and the foreign governments will continue or that the Company's designation to operate such routes will continue. The Company is also subject to domestic and international environmental regulations,
including rules on noise and emissions, that may affect the cost or scope of its services.


Economic Conditions

The demand for both business and leisure air transportation is affected by regional and national economic conditions. An economic downturn, or changes in
consumer preferences, perceptions or spending patterns, could affect the Company's ability to sustain its traffic volumes and yields.

Risk of Loss and Liability; Weather

The Company is exposed to potential catastrophic losses in the event of aircraft accidents or terrorist incidents. Consistent with industry standards, the
Company maintains vigorous safety, training and maintenance programs, as well as insurance against such losses. However, any aircraft accident, even if fully insured, could cause a negative public
perception of the Company with adverse financial consequences. Additionally, unusually adverse weather can significantly reduce flight operations, resulting in lost revenues and added expenses.

OTHER INFORMATION

Frequent Flyer Program

All major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty. Alaska's Mileage Plan allows members to earn mileage by
flying on Alaska, Horizon and other participating airlines, and by using the services of non-airline partners, which include a credit card partner, telephone companies, hotels and car
rental agencies. Alaska is paid by non-airline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts. With advance notice, Alaska has the ability to change the Mileage Plan terms,
conditions, partners, mileage credits and award levels.

Mileage
can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel industry awards. Upon accumulating the necessary mileage, members notify Alaska of their award selection.
Over 75% of the free flight awards on Alaska and Horizon are subject to blackout dates and capacity-controlled seating. Alaska's miles do not expire. As of year-end 1999 and 2000, Alaska
estimated that 1,129,000 and 1,582,000 round-trip flight awards were eligible for redemption by Mileage Plan members who have mileage credits exceeding the 20,000-mile free
round-trip domestic ticket award threshold. Of these eligible awards, Alaska estimated that 921,000 and 1,469,000, respectively, would ultimately be
redeemed. For the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, approximately 191,000, 226,000 and 281,000 round-trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on Alaska and Horizon. These awards represent
approximately 3.1% for 1998, 3.7% for 1999, and 4.8% for 2000, of the total passenger miles flown for each period. For the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, approximately 65,000, 99,000 and 137,000
round-trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners.

For
miles earned by flying on Alaska and travel partners, the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability
as miles are accumulated. The incremental cost does not include a contribution to overhead, aircraft cost or profit. Alaska also sells mileage credits to non-airline partners, such as
hotels, car rental agencies and a credit card company. Effective January 1, 2000, the Company began deferring a majority of the sales proceeds, and recognizing these proceeds as revenue when
the award transportation is provided. The deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued on Alaska and as other revenue-net for awards issued on other airlines. At
December 31, 1999 and 2000, the deferred revenue and the total liability for miles outstanding and for estimated payments to partner airlines was $40.0 million and $198.5 million,
respectively.

In negotiation

In
early 1999, a federal mediator was assigned to assist Horizon and the IBT in the negotiation of an initial labor contract covering pilots. Negotiations have taken place since then
until December 2000, when the IBT formally asked for a proffer of arbitration. In response to the mediator's request for its view, Horizon indicated that the request was premature. Further
negotiations are anticipated during the first quarter of 2001.

Part II,
Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition," discusses future orders and options for additional
aircraft.

Twenty
four of the 44 aircraft owned by Alaska as of December 31, 2000 are subject to liens securing long-term debt. Alaska's leased B737-200C,
B737-400 and MD-80 aircraft have lease expiration dates in 2001, between 2002 and 2016, and between 2001 and 2013, respectively. Horizon's leased de Havilland Dash 8 and Fokker
F-28 aircraft have expiration dates between 2000 and 2014 and between 2000 and 2002, respectively. However, as part of its fleet modernization plan, Horizon expects to return to the
lessors or otherwise dispose of 12 Dash 8-100 aircraft and 22 Fokker F-28 aircraft during 2001. Alaska and Horizon have the option to extend most of the leases for additional
periods, or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, usually at the then fair market value of the aircraft. For information regarding obligations under capital leases and
long-term operating leases, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

At
December 31, 2000, all of Alaska's aircraft met the Stage 3 noise requirements under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990. However, special noise ordinances restrict
the timing of flights operated by Alaska and other airlines at Burbank, Orange County, San Diego and San Jose. In addition, Orange County restricts the type of aircraft and number of flights.

Ground Facilities and Services

Alaska and Horizon lease ticket counters, gates, cargo and baggage, office space and other support areas at the majority of the airports they serve. Alaska
also owns terminal buildings at various Alaska cities.

Alaska
has centralized operations in several buildings located at or near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) in Seattle, Washington. The owned buildings,
including land unless located on leased airport property, include: a three-bay hangar facility with maintenance shops; a flight operations and training center; an air cargo facility; a
reservations and office facility; several office buildings; its corporate headquarters; and two storage warehouses. Alaska also leases a two-bay hangar/office facility at
Sea-Tac. Alaska's other major facilities include: a regional headquarters building, an air cargo facility and a leased hangar/office facility in Anchorage; a Phoenix reservations center;
and a leased two-bay maintenance facility in Oakland.

Horizon
owns its Seattle corporate headquarters building. It leases an operations, training and aircraft maintenance facility in Portland, and a maintenance facility in Boise.


ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In December 1998, search warrants and a grand jury subpoena (for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) were served on Alaska,
initiating an investigation into the Company's Oakland maintenance base by the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California. Alaska has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney's initial and
subsequent requests for information concerning the Company's maintenance operations. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a Letter of Investigation (LOI) to Alaska relating to
maintenance performed on an MD-80 aircraft. In April 1999, the FAA issued a notice of proposed civil penalty for $44,000. In July 1999, Alaska responded informally to the
notice, disputing that any violation occurred, and to date the FAA has not taken any further action. The Company understands that information developed by the National Transportation Safety Board in
connection with the crash of Flight 261 on January 31, 2000 is being shared with the U.S. Attorney and that the U.S. Attorney is using this information, along with other records relating to the
aircraft Alaska has produced, to evaluate whether any crimes were committed in connection with Flight 261. To the Company's knowledge, no charges have been filed as a result of the grand jury
investigation.

Alaska
is currently a defendant in a number of lawsuits relating to Flight 261. Between February 14, 2000 and the present, 82 wrongful death suits have been filed against
Alaska Airlines as a result of Flight 261. The Boeing Company, the manufacturer of the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer jackscrew assembly and the manufacturer of the grease used to lubricate the
jackscrew have also been named in the lawsuits. The suits were filed in federal courts in California, Illinois and Washington, as well as in state courts in Washington, Alaska and California. In early
July 2000 all of the cases (except the Washington state court case) were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs seek unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages. Although Alaska disputes the availability of punitive damages, it has stated in a court hearing its desire to settle all of the cases for full compensatory damages
without contesting liability. The Company is unable to predict the amount of claims that may ultimately be made against it or how those claims might be resolved. Consistent with industry standards,
the Company maintains insurance against aircraft accidents.

In
April 2000, the FAA began an audit of Alaska's maintenance and flight operations departments to ensure adherence to mandated procedures. During the audit, the FAA requested
that Alaska take a number of actions, which Alaska has done or is currently implementing. In June 2000, the FAA
informed Alaska that it was proposing to amend Alaska's operations specification to suspend the Company's ability to perform heavy maintenance on its aircraft. In June 2000, Alaska submitted an
Airworthiness and Operations Action Plan describing numerous steps Alaska would take to address the FAA's concerns. In response to this plan the FAA withdrew its proposal. The FAA also requested that
the Company submit a growth plan to demonstrate its ability to handle operationally its planned fleet additions. In June 2000, Alaska submitted its growth plan to the FAA. In July 2000,
Alaska responded in writing to each of the FAA's findings from its April audit. The FAA has issued a number of LOIs stemming from the resulting increased FAA oversight. Alaska is investigating and
responding to these LOIs. In December 2000, Alaska received notices of proposed civil penalties, totaling approximately $1 million, relating to some of these LOIs. The Company has not
been informed what further actions, if any, the FAA intends to take with respect to these matters.

The
Company cannot predict the outcome of any of the pending civil or potential criminal proceedings described above. As a result, the Company can give no assurance that these
proceedings, if determined adversely to Alaska, would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. However, while we cannot predict the outcome
of these matters, management believes their ultimate disposition is not likely to materially affect the Company's financial position or results of operations. This forward-looking statement is based
on management's current understanding of the relevant law and facts; it is subject to various contingencies, including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of
judges and juries.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Industry Conditions

The airline industry is cyclical. Generally speaking, economic conditions have been strong during the years covered by this discussion. Because the industry
has high fixed costs in relation to revenues, a small change in load factors or fare levels has a large impact on profits.

For
most airlines, labor and fuel account for almost half of operating expenses. The strong economy has increased employee turnover and put upward pressure on labor costs. Fuel prices
have been volatile in the last three years. For Alaska Airlines, fuel cost per gallon decreased 25% in 1998, increased 23% in 1999 and increased 54% in 2000.

In
recent years, airlines have reduced their ticket distribution costs by capping travel agent commissions, by decreasing commission rates from 10% to 5%, by partially eliminating
paper tickets and by selling tickets directly to passengers via the Internet.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2000 Compared with 1999

In accordance with guidance provided in the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, Alaska
changed its method of accounting for the sale of miles in its Mileage Plan. In connection with the change, Alaska recognized a $56.9 million cumulative effect charge, net of income taxes of
$35.6 million, effective January 1, 2000. The consolidated loss before accounting change for 2000 was $13.4 million, or $0.51 per share, compared with net income of
$134.2 million, or $5.06 per share (diluted) in 1999. The 1999 results (fourth quarter impact) included an after-tax gain on sale of shares in Equant N.V. of $2.2 million
($0.08 per diluted share). The consolidated operating loss was $20.6 million in 2000 compared with an operating income of $199.9 million in 1999. Higher fuel prices increased operating
expenses by approximately $125 million. Financial and statistical data for Alaska and Horizon is shown in Item 6. A discussion of this data follows.

Alaska Airlines

Revenues

Capacity increased 2.8% in the first quarter due to normal growth but decreased 1.3% in the second quarter due to maintenance delays. Capacity was then reduced
3.2% in the third quarter in order to improve schedule reliability. Finally, capacity increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter as schedule reliability returned to near-normal levels. For the
full year 2000, capacity was flat but traffic grew by 1.8%, resulting in a 1.3 point increase in passenger load factor. The Canada and Lower 48 states-to-Alaska markets
experienced the largest increases in load factor. Passenger yields were up 4.6% (3.2% excluding the impact of a new accounting method for the sale of miles), primarily due to fuel-related
fare increases. Yields were up in virtually all major markets. The higher traffic combined with the higher yield resulted in a 6.5% increase in passenger revenue.

Freight
and mail revenues decreased 4.5%, primarily due to 6.7% lower freight volumes that resulted from 1.8% fewer flights operated, lower seafood shipments and more competition.

Other-net
revenues decreased $26.5 million (32.6%), due to the change in accounting for the sale of miles in Alaska's frequent flyer program. If the new accounting
method had been in effect in 1999, other-net revenues would have increased $3.7 million (7.3%).

Expenses

Operating expenses grew by 17.2% as a result of an 17.3% increase in cost per ASM. The increase in cost per ASM was largely due to higher fuel prices, higher
labor and aircraft maintenance costs and


a special charge related to Mileage Plan estimates. Explanations of significant year-over-year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows:

•

Wages
and benefits increased 14.1% due to a 4.7% increase in the number of employees combined with a 9.0% increase in average wages and benefits per
employee. Management employees were hired in many areas (e.g. maintenance and quality control, computer services, training, marketing and employee services) to better manage the existing operations.
The number of pilots and flight attendants increased, in spite of no increase in capacity, due to training requirements. The 2000 results include a $1.8 million charge for a flight attendant
early retirement program. Absent this charge, average wages and benefits per employee increased 8.7%. The full-year impact of new labor contracts for mechanics, flight attendants,
passenger service and ramp service employees, combined with longevity increases for pilots and annual merit raises for management employees, all contributed to the higher average wage rates.

•

Contracted
services increased 18.9%. The 2000 results include $1.9 million for aircraft-accident-related expenses not covered by insurance. Absent
these expenses, contracted services increased 15.5% due to new costs for marketing information, higher contract labor and security costs, and higher rates for ground handling services.

•

Fuel
expense increased 52.6%, primarily due to a 54.2% increase in the cost per gallon of fuel. The fuel consumption rate decreased 2.1% due to the use of
more fuel-efficient B737-700 aircraft. Fuel hedging, which started in July 2000, saved $3.8 million.

•

Maintenance
expense increased 34.2%, due to greater use of outside contractors for airframe checks and a greater number of these checks, increased expenses
for engine repairs and overhauls, and increased work on airframe components.

•

Aircraft
rent expense decreased 8.2%, due to the leasing of four fewer MD-80 aircraft and two fewer B737-400 aircraft for most of
2000.

•

Commission
expense decreased 28.5% on a 6.5% increase in passenger revenue. The commission rate paid to travel agents in 2000 was 5% compared to the 8%
rate that was paid during most of 1999. In 2000, 64% of ticket sales were made through travel agents, versus 67% in 1999. In 2000, 10.4% of ticket sales were made through Alaska's Internet web site
versus 5.2% in 1999.

•

Other
selling expenses increased 19.8%, higher than the 6.5% increase in passenger revenue, primarily due to an $11.4 million increase in Mileage
Plan awards expense, as a result of the following trends: (a) more ways to earn miles, (b) less forfeitures of miles, (c) greater use of travel awards on other airlines, and
(d) higher costs to obtain awards on other airlines.

•

Depreciation
and amortization increased 23.6%, primarily due to the owning of more aircraft in 2000.

•

Other
expense increased 23.7%, primarily due to higher expenditures for legal fees, supplies, passenger remuneration, flight crew hotel charges and meals,
recruiting, personnel expenses and insurance.

•

The
$24.0 million special charge in 2000 recognizes the increased incremental cost of travel awards earned by flying on Alaska and travel partners.
The higher cost is due to an increase in the estimated costs Alaska incurs to acquire travel awards on other airlines for its Mileage Plan members, as well as lower assumed forfeiture of miles.


Horizon Air

Revenues

Capacity grew by 4.8%, primarily due to additional flights in the Canada and Montana markets. Traffic grew by 3.6%, resulting in a 0.8 point decrease in
passenger load factor. The loss of the marketing alliance with Canadian Airlines in August 2000 and fires in Montana during the Summer of 2000 contributed to the lower load factor. Passenger
yields were up 3.7%, largely due to "fuel surcharge" fare increases. The higher traffic combined with the higher yield resulted in a 7.4% increase in passenger revenue.

Expenses

Operating expenses grew by 14.9% as a result of a 4.8% increase in capacity and a 9.6% increase in cost per ASM. Explanations of significant
year-over-year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows:

•

Wages
and benefits increased 11.7% due to a 5.3% increase in the number of employees combined with a 6.1% increase in average wages and benefits per
employee. Employees were added to support 4.5% more block hours of flying and to prepare for growth in future periods.

•

Contracted
services increased 20.3%, higher than the 4.8% increase in capacity, due to increased expenses for ground handling, security and employee
recruiting.

•

Fuel
expense increased 57.4%, due to a 51.2% increase in the cost per gallon of fuel combined with a 4.1% increase in fuel consumption. Fuel hedging, which
started in July 2000, saved $0.9 million.

•

Maintenance
expense increased 30.4%, higher than the 4.5% increase in block hours, due in part to increased expenses related to the
earlier-than-previously estimated timeframe for phasing out the Fokker F-28 jet aircraft.

•

Commission
expense decreased 28.4% on a 7.4% increase in passenger revenue, because a smaller percentage of sales were made through travel agents and
commission rates dropped from 8% to 5%, effective in October 1999.

•

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased 24.0%, due in part to added depreciation on Fokker F-28 jet aircraft spare parts.

•

Landing
fees and other rentals increased 14.4%, due to increased rates at Seattle and Portland airports.

•

Other
expense increased 14.1%, primarily due to higher expenditures for supplies, insurance, personnel expenses and communications.

Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense)

Net nonoperating income decreased
$15.9 million, primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from new debt incurred in late 1999 and in the second half of 2000. In addition, a $3.6 million gain on the sale of
shares in Equant N.V. (a telecommunication network company owned by many airlines) was recorded in December 1999.

1999 Compared with 1998

Consolidated net income in 1999 was $134.2 million, or $5.06 per share (diluted),
compared with net income of $124.4 million, or $4.81 per share in 1998. Consolidated operating income was $199.9 million in 1999 compared with $211.0 million in 1998. Higher fuel
prices impacted operating income by $41.6 million.

Alaska Airlines

Operating income decreased 9.1% to $176.3 million, resulting in a 10.5% operating margin as
compared with a 12.4% margin in 1998. Capacity increased 3.2% and traffic grew by 4.4%. Operating revenue per ASM increased 4.0% to 9.69 cents while operating expenses per ASM


increased 6.3% to 8.68 cents. The increase in revenue per ASM was due to higher passenger yields combined with a higher passenger load factor. Higher unit costs were largely due to increased fuel,
labor and maintenance costs.

Horizon Air

Operating income increased 36.3% to $24.8 million, resulting in a 6.0% operating margin as compared
with a 5.2% margin in 1998. Capacity increased 20.9% and traffic grew by 20.6%. Operating revenue per ASM decreased 1.1% to 18.96 cents while operating expenses per ASM decreased 1.8% to 17.83 cents.

Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense)

Net nonoperating items improved $27.4 million over 1998 due to a
$16.5 million litigation settlement charge in 1998, $4.9 million lower interest expense and a $3.6 million gain on the sale of shares in Equant N.V. in 1999.

2000 Financial Changes

The Company's cash and marketable securities portfolio increased by
$132.7 million during 2000. Operating activities provided $265.0 million of cash during this period. Additional cash was provided by the issuance of $338.2 million of new debt.
Another $39.1 million was provided by insurance proceeds from an aircraft accident and other asset dispositions. Cash was used for $448.6 million of capital expenditures, including the
purchase of seven new Boeing 737 aircraft, flight equipment deposits and airframe and engine overhauls, and for $65.8 million of debt and capital lease repayment.

Shareholders'
equity decreased $68.4 million due to the net loss of $70.3 million, which was partly offset by stock issued under stock plans and changes in deferred
compensation.

Financing Activities

During 2000, Alaska issued $238.2 million of 12-year debt secured by flight
equipment. $148.2 million of the new debt has fixed interest rates of approximately 7.6%. Interest rates on the other $90.0 million varies with LIBOR. Alaska also issued
$100.0 million of unsecured debt, which is expected to be repaid in 2003 and 2004 and has an interest rate that varies with LIBOR.

Aircraft Accident

On January 31, 2000, Alaska Airlines Flight 261 from Puerto Vallarta en route to San
Francisco, went down in the water off the coast of California near Point Mugu. The flight carried 83 passengers and five crew members. There were no survivors. At present, 82 wrongful death lawsuits
have been filed against Alaska. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Because the Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation, it can give no assurance that
these proceedings, if determined adversely to Alaska, would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. While we cannot predict or quantify
the outcome of these matters, management believes their ultimate disposition is not likely to materially affect the Company's financial position or results of operations. Consistent with industry
standards, the


Company maintains insurance against aircraft accidents. The Company expects substantially all accident response and civil litigation costs to be covered by insurance.

Safety Activities

In March 2000, to enhance existing lines of communication, Alaska established a "safety
hotline" for employees to contact the chairman's office directly regarding any safety concern. In April 2000, an independent team of outside safety experts began a full audit of the
maintenance, flight operations, hazardous materials handling and security areas of Alaska. The team presented its final report to Alaska in June 2000 and Alaska is implementing those
recommendations. In November 2000, the team returned to review progress on its recommendations and to assist Alaska in focusing its ongoing safety efforts. Alaska has also hired a vice
president of safety, who reports directly to the chairman.

Commitments

At December 31, 2000, the Company had firm orders for 60 aircraft requiring aggregate payments of
approximately $1.2 billion, as set forth below. In addition, Alaska has options to acquire 26 more B737s, and Horizon has options to acquire 15 Dash 8-400s and 25 CRJ 700s. Alaska
and Horizon expect to finance the new planes with leases, long-term debt or internally generated cash.

Deferred Taxes

At December 31, 2000, net deferred tax liabilities were $104 million,
which includes $156 million of net temporary differences offset by $52 million of deferred tax assets.

New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. SFAS 133 requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or
liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies
for hedge accounting. If the derivative qualifies as a hedge, the change in its fair value will be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. At
December 31, 2000, the Company's fuel hedge contracts had an estimated fair value of $2.1 million, with unrealized losses of $1.2 million.

1999 Financial Changes

The Company's cash and marketable securities portfolio increased by $22 million during
1999. Operating activities provided $330 million of cash in 1999. Additional cash was provided by the issuance of new debt ($232 million), sale and leaseback of three Dash
8-200 aircraft ($30 million), flight equipment deposits returned ($8 million) and the exercise of stock options ($6 million). Cash was used for $565 million of
capital expenditures, including the purchase of nine new Boeing 737 aircraft, two formerly leased Boeing 737s, three new Dash 8-200 aircraft, flight equipment deposits, an aircraft
simulator and airframe and engine overhauls, and for $27 million of debt repayment.

1998 Financial Changes

The Company's cash and marketable securities portfolio increased by $94 million during
1998. Operating activities provided $310 million of cash in 1998. Additional cash was


provided by the sale and leaseback of nine B737-400 aircraft and 12 Dash 8-200 aircraft ($402 million) and the return of $33 million of equipment deposits. Cash
was used for $613 million of capital expenditures, including the purchase of nine new B737-400 aircraft, a previously leased B737-400 aircraft, 12 new Dash
8-200 aircraft, flight equipment deposits and airframe and engine overhauls and the repayment of debt ($46 million). Shareholders' equity increased $314 million due to the
conversion of $186 million of convertible bonds into common stock, net income of $124 million and issuance of $7 million of common stock under stock plans.

Effect of Inflation

Inflation and specific price changes do not have a significant effect on the Company's operating
revenues, operating expenses and operating income, because such revenues and expenses generally reflect current price levels.

Market Risk

The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The
Company has material market risk exposure to jet fuel price increases. Currently, a one-cent change in the fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately
$3.7 million. To help manage this exposure, the Company began purchasing primarily crude oil call options during 2000. Settlement of these options during the last half of 2000 resulted in a
gain of $4.7 million. At December 31, 2000, the Company had purchased crude oil call options in place to hedge approximately 23% of its 2001 expected jet fuel requirements. A
hypothetical 10% increase in jet fuel prices would increase 2001 fuel expense by approximately $31 million. This analysis includes the effect of the fuel hedging contracts in place at
December 31, 2000.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

December 31, 2000

Note 1

.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Company or Air Group) and its subsidiaries, the principal
subsidiaries being Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. Preparation of financial
statements requires the use of management's estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years' financial statements to conform to the
2000 presentation.

Nature of Operations

Alaska and Horizon operate as airlines. However, their business plans, competition and economic risks differ substantially. Alaska is a major airline serving
Alaska; Vancouver, Canada; the U.S. West Coast and Mexico. It operates an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is 886 miles. Horizon is a regional airline serving the Pacific Northwest,
Northern California and Western Canada. It operates both jet and turboprop aircraft, and its average passenger trip is 283 miles. Substantially all of Alaska's and Horizon's sales occur in the United
States. See Note 11 for operating segment information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with purchase maturities of three months or less. They are carried at cost, which approximates market.
The Company reduces its cash balance when checks are disbursed. Due to the time delay in checks clearing the banks, the Company normally maintains a negative cash balance on its books which is
reported as a current liability. The amount of the negative cash balance was $22.6 million and $31.6 million at December 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively.

Inventories and Supplies

Expendable and repairable aircraft parts, as well as other materials and supplies, are stated at average cost. An allowance for obsolescence of flight
equipment expendable and repairable parts is accrued based on estimated disposal date and salvage value. Surplus inventories are carried at their net realizable value. The allowance at
December 31, 1999 and 2000 for all inventories was $23.8 million and $27.6 million, respectively.


Property, Equipment and Depreciation

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which are as follows:

Aircraft and related flight equipment:

Assets
and related obligations for items financed under capital leases are initially recorded at an amount equal to the present value of the future minimum lease payments. The cost of
major airframe overhauls, engine overhauls, and other modifications which extend the life or improve the usefulness of aircraft are capitalized and amortized over their estimated period of use. Other
repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment.

Intangible Assets-Subsidiaries

The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as an intangible asset and is amortized over 40 years.
Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1999 and 2000 was $27.2 million and $29.3 million, respectively.

Frequent Flyer Awards

Alaska operates a frequent flyer program ("Mileage Plan") that provides travel awards to members based on accumulated mileage. For miles earned by flying on
Alaska and travel partners, the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated. Alaska also sells
mileage credits to non-airline partners, such as hotels, car rental agencies and a credit card company. Effective January 1, 2000, the Company began deferring a majority of the
sales proceeds, and recognizing these proceeds as revenue when the award transportation is provided. The deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued on Alaska and as other
revenue-net for awards issued on other airlines. See Note 12 for more information.

Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue results from the sale of mileage credits, the sale and leaseback of aircraft, and the receipt of manufacturer or vendor credits. This revenue
is recognized when award transportation is provided or over the term of the applicable agreements.

Leased Aircraft Return Costs

The costs associated with returning leased aircraft are accrued over the lease periods. As leased aircraft are retired, the costs are charged against the
established reserve. The reserve is part of other liabilities, and at December 31, 1999 and 2000 was $48.9 million and $57.9 million, respectively.


Passenger Revenues

Passenger revenues are recognized when the passenger travels. Tickets sold but not yet used are reported as air traffic liability.

Contracted Services

Contracted services includes expenses for ground handling, security, navigation fees, temporary employees, data processing fees and other similar services.

Other Selling Expenses

Other selling expenses includes credit card commissions, computerized reservations systems (CRS) charges, Mileage Plan free travel awards, advertising and
promotional costs. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense was $17.9 million, $17.0 million, and $19.7 million,
respectively, in 1998, 1999 and 2000.

Capitalized Interest

Interest is capitalized on flight equipment purchase deposits and ground facility progress payments as a cost of the related asset and is depreciated over the
estimated useful life of the asset.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, which requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.

Stock Options

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for stock options. See Note 6 for more information.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, generally with maturities of less than one month, to manage risk associated with net foreign
currency transactions. Resulting gains and losses are recognized currently in other operating expense. The Company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate risk.
The differential to be paid or received from these agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognized currently in the income statement. At December 31, 2000, there were no
foreign currency contracts or interest rate swap agreements outstanding. The Company periodically enters into hedge agreements to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the price of jet fuel.
Resulting gains and losses are recognized currently in fuel expense.

Effective
January 1, 2001, the Company will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as
amended. SFAS 133 requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those
derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. If the derivative qualifies as a hedge, the change in its fair value will be
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2000, the Company's fuel hedge contracts for 94 million gallons of projected jet
fuel usage had an estimated fair value of $2.1 million, with unrealized losses of $1.2 million.

At
December 31, 2000, borrowings of $558.1 million are secured by flight equipment and real property. During 2000, Alaska issued $238.2 million of
12-year debt secured by flight equipment. $148.2 million of the new debt has fixed interest rates of approximately 7.6%. Interest rates on the other $90.0 million varies with
LIBOR. Alaska also issued $100.0 million of unsecured debt, which is expected to be repaid in 2003 and 2004, and has an interest rate which varies with LIBOR.

At
December 31, 2000, Alaska had a credit facility with commercial banks that allows it to borrow up to $150 million until December 2004. Borrowings under this
facility bear interest at a rate that varies based on LIBOR. At December 31, 2000, no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility.

Certain
Alaska loan agreements contain provisions that require maintenance of specific levels of net worth, leverage and fixed charge coverage, and limit investments, lease
obligations, sales of assets and additional indebtedness. At December 31, 2000 the Company was in compliance with all loan provisions, and under the most restrictive loan provisions, Alaska had
$301 million of net worth above the minimum.

The Company has firm orders for 16 Boeing 737 series aircraft to be delivered between 2001 and 2002, 14 Dash 8-400s during 2001, and 30 Canadair RJ
700 jets between 2001 and 2005. The firm orders require payments of approximately $1.2 billion between 2001 and 2005. As of December 31, 2000, deposits of $266 million related to
the firm orders had been made. In addition to the ordered aircraft, the Company holds purchase options on 26 Boeing 737s, 15 Dash 8-400s and 25 CRJ 700s.

Note 6. Stock Plans

Air Group has three stock option plans, which provide for the purchase of Air Group common stock at a stipulated price on the date of grant by certain officers
and key employees of Air Group and its subsidiaries. Under the 1996, 1997 and 1999 Plans, options for 1,940,900 shares have been granted and, at December 31, 2000, 736,375 shares were available
for grant. Under all plans, the incentive and nonqualified stock options granted have terms of up to approximately ten years. Substantially all grantees are 25% vested after one year, 50% after two
years, 75% after three years and 100% after four years.

The
fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants in 1998, 1999 and
2000, respectively: dividend yield of 0% for all years; volatility of 35%, 40% and 44%; risk-free interest rates of 5.67%, 5.53% and 6.62%; and expected lives of 5 years for all
years. Using these assumptions, the weighted average fair value of options granted was $19.33, $17.39 and $14.58 in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.

Air
Group follows APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for stock options. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for these plans. Had compensation
cost for the Company's stock options been determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting


Standards No. 123, income before accounting change and applicable earnings per share (EPS) would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below.

Note 7. Employee Benefit Plans

Pension Plans

Four defined benefit and five defined contribution retirement plans cover various employee groups of Alaska and Horizon.

The
defined benefit plans provide benefits based on an employee's term of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. Pension plans are funded
as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The defined benefit plan assets


consist primarily of marketable equity and fixed income securities. The following table sets forth the status of the plans for 1999 and 2000 (in millions):

Alaska
and Horizon also maintain an unfunded, noncontributory benefit plan for certain elected officers. The $26 million unfunded accrued pension cost for this plan was accrued
as of December 31, 2000.

The
defined contribution plans are deferred compensation plans under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. All of these plans require Company contributions. Total
expense for the


defined contribution plans was $11.6 million, $13.5 million and $16.9 million, respectively, in 1998, 1999 and 2000.

Profit Sharing Plans

Alaska and Horizon have employee profit sharing plans. Profit sharing expense for 1998, 1999 and 2000 was $23.2 million, $22.8 million and $0.0,
respectively.

Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company allows retirees to continue their medical, dental and vision benefits by paying all or a portion of the active employee plan premium until eligible
for Medicare, currently age 65. This results in a subsidy to retirees because the premiums received by the Company are less than the actual cost of the retirees' claims. The accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation (APBO) for this subsidy at December 31, 1999 and 2000 was $25.4 million and $28.7 million, respectively. The APBO is unfunded and is included with other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Annual expense related to this subsidy is not considered material to disclose.

Note 8. Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities comprise the following at December 31 (in millions):

The
fair value of cash equivalents approximates carrying value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market
prices. The fair value of fuel hedge contracts is based on commodity exchange prices. The fair value of restricted deposits approximates the carrying amount. At December 31, 1999, the fair
value of restricted depository certificates convertible into the common stock of Equant N.V. was $7 million based on sales of Equant N.V. stock in 1999. At December 31, 2000, the fair
value of these certificates was $2 million based on a purchase offer from an independent organization. The fair value of long-term debt is based on a discounted cash flow analysis.

Note 10. Earnings per Share (EPS)

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income plus the
after-tax interest expense on convertible debt by the average common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would have been outstanding if conversion of the convertible debt
and exercise of in-the-money stock options is assumed. Stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because they are antidilutive,


represented 0.3 million, 0.3 million and 1.8 million shares, respectively, in 1998, 1999 and 2000. EPS calculations were as follows (in millions except per share amounts):

Change in Accounting Principle

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
SAB 101 gives specific guidance on the conditions that must be met before revenue may be recognized, and in June 2000 Alaska changed its method of accounting for the sale of miles in its
Mileage Plan. Under the new method, a majority of the sales proceeds is deferred, then recognized ratably over the estimated period of time that the award transportation is provided. The deferred
proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued on Alaska and as other revenue—net for awards issued on other airlines. In connection with the change, Alaska recognized a
$56.9 million cumulative effect charge, net of income taxes of $35.6 million, effective January 1, 2000.


Proforma Results (Unaudited)

The change in accounting for the sale of miles, if applied to prior years, would have produced these pro forma results (in millions except per share amounts).

Special Charge—Mileage Plan

In June 2000, Alaska recorded a $24.0 million special charge to recognize the increased incremental cost of travel awards earned by flying on
Alaska and travel partners. The higher cost is due to an increase in the estimated costs Alaska incurs to acquire awards on other airlines for its Mileage Plan members, as well as lower assumed
forfeiture of miles.

Note 13. Contingencies

In December 1998, search warrants and a grand jury subpoena (for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) were served on Alaska,
initiating an investigation into the Company's Oakland maintenance base by the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California. Alaska has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney's initial and
subsequent requests for information concerning the Company's maintenance operations. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a Letter of Investigation (LOI) to Alaska relating to
maintenance performed on an MD-80 aircraft. In April 1999, the FAA issued a notice of proposed civil penalty for $44,000. In July 1999, Alaska responded informally to the
notice, disputing that any violation occurred, and to date the FAA has not taken any further action. The Company understands that information developed by the National Transportation Safety Board in
connection with the crash of Flight 261 on January 31, 2000 is being shared with the U.S. Attorney and that the U.S. Attorney is using this information, along with other records relating to the
aircraft Alaska has produced, to evaluate whether any crimes were committed in


connection with Flight 261. To the Company's knowledge, no charges have been filed as a result of the grand jury investigation.

Alaska
is currently a defendant in a number of lawsuits relating to Flight 261. The Company is unable to predict the amount of claims that may ultimately be made against it or how
those claims might be resolved. Consistent with industry standards, the Company maintains insurance against aircraft accidents.

In
April 2000, the FAA began an audit of Alaska's maintenance and flight operations departments to ensure adherence to mandated procedures. During the audit, the FAA requested
that Alaska take a number of actions, which Alaska has done or is currently implementing. In June 2000, the FAA informed Alaska that it was proposing to amend Alaska's operations specification
to suspend the Company's ability to perform heavy maintenance on its aircraft. In June 2000, Alaska submitted an Airworthiness and Operations Action Plan describing numerous steps Alaska would
take to address the FAA's concerns. In response to this plan the FAA withdrew its proposal. The FAA also requested that the Company submit a growth plan to demonstrate its ability to handle
operationally its planned fleet additions. In June 2000, Alaska submitted its growth plan to the FAA. In July 2000, Alaska responded in writing to each of the FAA's findings from its
April audit. The FAA has issued a number of LOIs stemming from the resulting increased FAA oversight. Alaska is investigating and responding to these LOIs. In December 2000, Alaska received
notices of proposed civil penalties, totaling approximately $1 million, relating to some of these LOIs. The Company has not been informed what further actions, if any, the FAA intends to take
with respect to these matters.

The
Company cannot predict the outcome of any of the pending civil or potential criminal proceedings described above. As a result, the Company can give no assurance that these
proceedings, if determined adversely to Alaska, would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. However, while we cannot predict or quantify
the outcome of these matters, management believes their ultimate disposition is not likely to materially affect the Company's financial position or results of operations. This forward-looking
statement is based on management's current understanding of the relevant law and facts; it is subject to various contingencies, including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and
the actions of judges and juries.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alaska Air Group, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

As
explained in Notes 1 and 12 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 2000, the Company changed its method of accounting for the sale of airline miles in its Mileage
Plan.

Our
audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in Item 14(a) is presented for purposes of complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.
