ITEM 1.BUSINESS

General
Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group or the Company) is a holding company
incorporated in Delaware in 1985.  Its two principal subsidiaries are Alaska
Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Both
subsidiaries operate as airlines.  However, each subsidiary's business plan,
competition and economic risks differ substantially.  Alaska is a major airline,
operates an all jet fleet, and its average passenger trip length is 850 miles.
Horizon is a regional airline, operates jet and turboprop aircraft, and its
average passenger trip is 210 miles. Business segment information is reported in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company's executive offices
are located at 19300 Pacific Highway South, Seattle, Washington 98188.

The business of the Company is somewhat seasonal.  Quarterly operating income
tends to peak during the third quarter.

Alaska
Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation, organized in 1937.  Alaska serves 36
airports in six states (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada and
Arizona), three cities in Mexico and three cities in Russia.  In each year since
1973, Alaska has carried more passengers between Alaska and the U.S. mainland
than any other airline.  Alaska Airlines also serves four smaller cities in
California, four in Washington, and many small communities in Alaska through
subcontracts with local carriers.

In 1994, Alaska carried 9.0 million passengers.  Passenger traffic within Alaska
and between Alaska and the U.S. mainland accounted for 25% of Alaska's total
revenue passenger miles, while West Coast traffic accounted for 65% and the
Mexico markets 10%.  Based on passenger enplanements, Alaska's leading airports
are Seattle, Portland, Anchorage and Los Angeles.  Based on revenues, its
leading nonstop routes were Seattle-Anchorage, Seattle-Los Angeles and Seattle-
San Francisco.

Alaska's operating fleet at December 31, 1994 consisted of 72 jet aircraft.

Horizon
Horizon, a Washington corporation, began service in 1981 and was acquired by Air
Group in 1986.  It is the largest regional airline in the Pacific Northwest, and
serves 36 airports in six states (Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, Utah and
California) and two cities in Canada.  In 1994, Horizon carried 3.5 million
passengers.  Based on passenger enplanements, Horizon's leading airports are
Seattle, Portland, Spokane and Boise.  Based on revenues, its leading nonstop
routes were Seattle-Spokane, Seattle-Portland, Seattle-Boise, Seattle-Vancouver,
B.C. and Portland-Boise.  At December 31, 1994, Horizon's operating fleet
consisted of ten jet and 55 turboprop aircraft.

Horizon flights are listed under the Alaska Airlines designator code in airline
computer reservation systems.  Certain Horizon flights are dual-designated in
these reservation systems as Northwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines.  Currently,
32% of Horizon's passengers connect to either Alaska or Northwest.

Airline Regulation
United States Department of Transportation (DOT) - The DOT has the authority to
regulate certain airline economic functions including financial and statistical
reporting, consumer protection, computerized reservations systems and essential
air transportation.  The DOT is also charged with determining which U.S.
carriers will receive the authority to provide service to international
destinations.  International operating authority is subject to bilateral
agreements between the United States and the respective countries.  The
countries establish the number of carriers to provide service, approve the
carriers selected to provide such service and the size of aircraft to be used.
The DOT reviews the carriers authorized under bilateral agreements every five
years.  Horizon's authority to operate the Seattle-Vancouver, Seattle-Victoria
and the Portland-Vancouver routes is to be reviewed in August 1997, March 1999
and July 1995, respectively.  Alaska's authority to serve its various Mexico
destinations are to be reviewed during 1995 and 1996.  The bilateral agreement
with Russia will be reviewed in December 1995.  The Company expects to be
granted authority to continue to operate its international routes.  During
January 1995, Alaska applied to the DOT to serve Oakland and San Diego from
Vancouver.

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) - The FAA, an agency within the DOT, has
jurisdiction to regulate aviation safety generally, including: the licensing of
pilots and maintenance personnel; the establishment of minimum standards for
training and maintenance; and technical standards of flight, communications and
ground equipment.  All aircraft must have and maintain certificates of
airworthiness issued by the FAA.  Alaska and Horizon aircraft, maintenance
facilities and procedures are subject to inspection by the FAA.  The FAA has the
authority to suspend temporarily or revoke permanently the authority of an air
carrier or its licensed personnel for failure to comply with Federal Aviation
Regulations and to levy civil penalties for such failure.

Labor Relations - The air transportation industry is regulated under the Railway
Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation Board certain regulatory powers
with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions arising under
collective bargaining agreements.

Environmental - Special noise ordinances or agreements restrict the type of
aircraft, the timing and the number of flights operated by Alaska and other air
carriers at five Los Angeles area airports plus San Diego, Palm Springs, San
Francisco and Seattle.

In 1990, Congress passed the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (Act).  The
Act addressed the need to establish a national aviation noise policy and limit
the ability of airports and local communities to implement procedures that would
interfere with interstate commerce or the national air transportation system.
The Act also called for the phase out of Stage II airplanes (generally older
aircraft not meeting certain noise emission standards) in the contiguous 48
states by December 31, 1999.  The Stage II phase-out provisions of the Act do
not apply to aircraft operated solely within the state of Alaska.  To implement
the phase out within the contiguous 48 states, the FAA has proposed regulations
and a timetable.  Alaska believes that its current fleet plan will enable it to
comply with the FAA's proposed regulations.
Competition
Competition in the air transportation industry is intense.  Currently, any
domestic air carrier deemed fit by the DOT is allowed to operate scheduled
passenger service in the United States.  Together, Alaska and Horizon carry less
than 2% of all U.S. passenger traffic.

Alaska and Horizon compete in the West Coast, Arizona and Nevada markets with
American, America West, Delta, MarkAir, Reno Air, Shuttle by United, Southwest
Airlines, United and United Express.  Alaska also competes primarily with
United, Northwest, Delta and MarkAir in the Lower 48-to-Alaska market.  Some of
these competitors are substantially larger than Alaska and Horizon, have greater
financial resources and have more extensive route systems.  Due to its shorthaul
markets, Horizon is subject to competition from surface transportation,
particularly the private automobile.

Alaska and Horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide the best possible
service between any two points served by their systems.  Both airlines
distinguish themselves from competitors by providing a higher level of customer
service.  The airlines' excellent service in the form of attention to customer
needs, high-quality food and beverage service, more legroom, well-maintained
aircraft and other amenities has been recognized by independent studies and
surveys of air travelers.  Alaska and Horizon offer competitive fares.

Most large U.S. carriers have developed, independently or in partnership with
others, large computerized reservation systems (CRS).  Due to contractual
requirements imposed by CRSs, most travel agencies contract with a single CRS to
sell tickets.  Airlines, including Alaska and Horizon, are charged industry-set
fees to have their flight schedules included in the various CRS displays.  These
systems are currently the predominant means of distributing airline tickets.  In
order to reduce anti-competitive practices, the DOT regulates the display of all
airline schedules and fares.  Alaska is exploring alternatives to existing
distribution methods.  American Airlines, owner of the SABRE CRS, has filed suit
against Alaska to prevent Alaska from reducing its level of display purchased
from SABRE without also doing so in all other CRSs.  At Alaska's request, the
DOT is seeking comment from interested parties on the subject.

Frequent Flyer Program
All major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing
passenger loyalty.  Alaska's Mileage Plan allows members to earn mileage by
flying on Alaska, Horizon and other participating airlines, and by using the
services of non-airline partners which include a credit card, telephone
companies, hotels and car rental agencies.  Alaska is paid by non-airline
partners for the miles it credits to member accounts.  Alaska has the ability to
change the Mileage Plan terms, conditions, partners, mileage credits and award
levels.

Mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel
industry awards.  Upon accumulating the necessary mileage, members notify Alaska
of their award selection.  Once selected, awards can be changed, subject to a
change fee.  Over 90% of the flight awards selected are subject to blackout
dates and capacity-controlled seating.  Currently, miles earned must be redeemed
within three years, otherwise they expire.

As of the year end 1994 and 1993, Alaska estimates that 662,000 and 698,000
roundtrip flight awards could have been redeemed by Mileage Plan members who
have mileage credits exceeding the free ticket threshold.  At December 31, 1994,
fewer than 27% of these flight awards were issued and outstanding.  Effective
January 31, 1995, the threshold for a free round trip domestic award will be
increased from 15,000 miles to 20,000 miles.

For the years 1994, 1993 and 1992, approximately 226,000, 188,000 and 174,000
round trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on Alaska and Horizon.  These
awards represent approximately 5% of the total passenger miles flown for each
period.

Alaska maintains a liability for its Mileage Plan obligation which is based on
its total miles outstanding, less an estimate for miles which will never be
redeemed.  The net miles outstanding are  allocated between those credited for
travel on Alaska, Horizon or other airline partners and those credited for using
the services of non-airline partners.  Miles credited for travel on Alaska,
Horizon or  other airline partners are accrued at Alaska's incremental cost of
providing the air travel.  The incremental cost includes the cost of meals,
fuel, reservations and insurance.  The incremental cost does not include a
contribution to overhead, aircraft cost or profit.  A portion of the proceeds
from non-airline partners is also deferred.  At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the
total liability for miles outstanding was  $17.4 million and $14.7 million,
respectively.

Results for 4th Quarter 1993 include an after-tax special charge of $9.8 million
to recognize the lower value of the Boeing 727 fleet and the acceleration of its
retirement.  The fully diluted earnings per share amounts for the second and
third quarters differ from those previously reported.  The Company changed the
earnings per share calculation to properly reflect the dilution of the
investment options that remain outstanding after the 1993 repurchase of
convertible preferred stock.  The total of the amounts shown as quarterly
earnings per share may differ from the amount shown on the Consolidated
Statement of Income because the annual computation is made separately and is
based upon average number of shares and equivalent shares outstanding for the
year.

Employees
Alaska had 6,901 active full-time and part-time employees at December 31, 1994,
of which approximately 87% are represented by labor unions.
The unions and the number of Alaska employees represented by each as of December

Part II, Item 7., "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
and Financial Condition," discusses future orders and options for additional
aircraft.

Sixteen of the 23 aircraft owned by Alaska as of December 31, 1994 are subject
to liens securing long-term debt.  The leased McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft
have expiration dates of 1995 to 2013.  The B737-400 leases have expiration
dates of 2002 to 2004.  Horizon's leased Fairchild Metroliner III, de Havilland
Dash 8, Fokker F-28 and Dornier 328 aircraft have expiration dates of 1995 to
2001, 1995 to 2006, 1996 to 1997, and 2008 to 2009, respectively.  Alaska and
Horizon have the option to extend most of the leases for additional periods, or
the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, usually at the
then fair market value of the aircraft.  For information regarding obligations
under capital leases and long-term operating leases, see Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Ground Facilities and Services
Alaska and Horizon lease ticket counters, gates, cargo and baggage, office space
and other support areas at the majority of the airports they serve.  Alaska also
owns terminal buildings at various Alaska cities and Horizon owns its terminal
at the Portland International Airport.

Alaska has centralized operations in several buildings located at or near
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) in Seattle, Washington.  The
owned buildings, including land unless located on leased airport property,
include: a three-bay hangar facility with maintenance shops; a flight operations
and training center; an air cargo facility; a reservation and office facility; a
four-story office building; its corporate headquarters; and two storage
warehouses.  Alaska also leases a two-bay hangar/office facility at Sea-Tac.

Alaska's other major facilities include: its Anchorage regional headquarters
building and Phoenix reservations center; a leased two-bay maintenance facility
in Oakland; and a leased hangar/office facility in Anchorage.

Horizon owns its Seattle corporate headquarters building and leases a
maintenance facility at the Portland airport.


ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In October 1991, Alaska gave notice of termination of its code sharing and
frequent flyer relationship with MarkAir, an airline based in the state of
Alaska.  Both companies have filed suit against one another in connection with
that termination alleging breach of contract and other causes of action under
state law.  In addition, MarkAir claimed that the termination was in violation
of Federal Antitrust Laws.  MarkAir filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June 1992.  In December 1993, MarkAir agreed to dismiss
all antitrust claims against the Company.  In 1994, the U.S. District Court
which had jurisdiction over the case approved the settlement.  Discovery
continues in a related Alaska state court case pertaining to breach of contract
and other state law claims.  The Company believes the ultimate resolution of
this legal proceeding will not result in a material adverse impact on the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.

In December 1992, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit against most major
domestic airlines, including the Company, alleging that they have violated the
antitrust laws by conspiring to fix prices for domestic airline tickets in
violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  During 1994, six of the airlines,
including the Company, entered into consent decrees with the U.S. Department of
Justice.  The agreement requires no refunds or monetary cost to the Company.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
       FINANCIAL CONDITION

Industry Conditions
During 1994, the character of competition changed on the West Coast due to the
December 1993 purchase of Morris Air by Southwest Airlines, and the October
start-up of Shuttle by United.  Low air fares are now a permanent part of the
fare structure on the West Coast.

The Company has responded to the changing industry environment by aggressively
matching competitors' air fares, increasing flight frequency, and improving
utilization of aircraft, facilities, equipment and people.

Results of Operations
1994 COMPARED WITH 1993  Consolidated net income in 1994 was $22.5 million, or
$1.68 per share (primary) and $1.62 per share (fully diluted), compared with a
net loss of $30.9 million, or $2.51 per share, in 1993.  The fully diluted
calculation is based on 19.6 million shares, which gives effect to the 1993
repurchase of the convertible preferred stock.  The results for 1993 include an
after-tax special charge of $9.8 million to recognize the lower value of the
Boeing 727 fleet and the acceleration of its retirement.  Without such charge,
the 1993 net loss would have been $21.1 million, or $1.77 per share.

Operating income was $75.0 million compared to an operating loss of $16.8
million for 1993.  The improved operating results reflect higher operating
revenues, and the effects of cost reductions and productivity improvements.

Operating revenues increased 17% to $1.316 billion.  Passenger revenues, which
accounted for 89% of total operating revenues, increased 17% on a 37% increase
in passenger traffic.  Traffic gains were due to a 27% increase in system
capacity, lower fares that stimulated traffic throughout most of the system, and
improvements in market share.  The load factor increased from 58.3% in 1993 to
62.8%.  Yields declined 15% to 14.1 cents in 1994.  The static value of a one
cent movement in yield is approximately $80 million per year.  However, in a
dynamic, price-sensitive business, a one cent increase will not necessarily
result in a revenue improvement of this magnitude.

Freight and mail revenues increased $7.5 million or 9% due to a military charter
contract in the state of Alaska, increased freight volumes, and increased
freight rates, offset by lower mail volumes.  The lower mail volumes resulted
from Alaska's decision to not bid on certain U.S. mail contracts so that
capacity could be made available for higher yielding freight.

Other-net revenues rose by $11.6 million or 27% due to increased revenues from
Alaska's frequent flyer program, maintenance contracts and inflight liquor
sales.

Operating Expenses   Operating expenses increased 8% to $1.241 billion on a
capacity increase of 27%.  For the separate airlines, Alaska's operating
expenses increased 7% to $998.7 million on a 28% increase in capacity, and
Horizon's operating expenses increased 14% to $244.0 million on an 18% increase
in capacity.  A discussion of operating expenses for the two airlines follows.

Alaska Airlines  The table below shows the major operating expense elements on a
unit-cost basis for Alaska in 1994 and 1993.

Alaska Airlines Total             8.27      9.88        (1.61)     (16)

Alaska's lower unit costs were due to an extensive cost reduction effort and
better utilization of aircraft, facilities, equipment and people, as well as a
2% increase in average seats per aircraft.  Average daily aircraft utilization
increased 26% from 8.2 block hours to 10.3 block hours.  Wages and benefits per
ASM decreased 16% primarily due to improved productivity  The number of
equivalent employees increased 5% while capacity increased 28% and traffic
increased 38%.  Effective May 1, 1994, Alaska and the Association of Flight
Attendants began a new five-year contract, which is modeled after the contract
used at Southwest Airlines and which provides flight attendants the opportunity
to earn increased wages through increased flying.  It also provides a lower
starting rate of pay, more flexible work rules and reduced pension expenses.

Fuel expense per ASM decreased 18% due to a 10% decrease in the price of fuel
and the continued transition to more fuel efficient aircraft.  The average cost
per gallon declined 6.9 cents to 59.9 cents in 1994.  Lower fuel prices reduced
fuel expense by $15.1 million.  Currently, a 1 cent change in fuel prices
affects annual fuel costs by approximately $2.2 million.

Maintenance expense per ASM decreased 26% due to the replacement of older
aircraft and due to significant improvements in maintenance programs, techniques
and efficiency.  With an average age of less than six years at December 31,
1994, Alaska's fleet is believed to be one of the youngest among U.S. jet
airlines.

Aircraft rent per ASM decreased 16% primarily due to a substantial increase in
utilization, offset by higher rents for new aircraft.

Depreciation and amortization expense per ASM decreased 25% due to the
retirement of the 727 fleet and increased utilization of the remaining aircraft.

Other expense per ASM decreased 8% due to lower unit costs for advertising,
food, building rentals and personnel expenses.


Horizon Air  The table below shows the major operating expense elements on a
unit-cost basis for Horizon for 1994 and 1993.

Horizon Air Total                20.95     21.75         (.80)      (4)

Horizon's cost per ASM declined 4% to 20.95 cents due to the acquisition of
higher capacity aircraft and cost reduction efforts.

Other Income (Expense)  Other Income (Expense) increased $5.0 million to $34.0
million.  Interest expense was $9.3 million higher in 1994 due to higher
interest rates on variable debt and higher average debt balances.  Other-net
income increased $4.1 million due to gains on the early retirement of debt and
vendor credits.

1993 COMPARED WITH 1992  The consolidated net loss for 1993 was $30.9 million,
or $2.51 per share, compared with a net loss of $84.8 million, or $6.87 per
share, in 1992.  The results include an after-tax charge of $9.8 million in 1993
and $16.6 million in 1992 for the early retirement of the 727 fleet.  In
addition, 1992 includes a $4.6 million charge related to a change in accounting
for postretirement benefits.  The operating loss for 1993 was $16.8 million,
compared to an operating loss of $94.8 million for 1992.  The improved operating
results reflect lower operating expenses.

Operating revenues in 1993 were $1.128 billion, 1% greater than the $1.115
billion posted in 1992.  Passenger revenues were approximately even with 1992
due to a 1% increase in traffic, offset by a 1% decline in yields.  Freight and
mail revenues increased $6.7 million or 9% due to increased freight and mail
rates and increased service in Alaska.  Other-net revenues rose $4.9 million or
13% due to increased revenues from Alaska's frequent flyer program.

Operating expenses decreased 5% to $1.145 billion.  The decrease was primarily
due to a cost reduction program initiated during the first quarter 1993.
Operating expenses per ASM declined 4% from 11.5 cents to 11.0 cents.  Fuel
expense per ASM decreased 12% due to the use of more fuel-efficient aircraft and
a 3% decrease in the cost of fuel.  Maintenance expense per ASM declined 22% due
to the replacement of older aircraft.  Aircraft rent and depreciation expense
per ASM rose 19% due to the addition of new aircraft.  Other expenses per ASM
decreased 12% due to lower expenditures for food, advertising, promotion,
supplies and personnel expenses.

Other Income (Expense) was $29.0 million in 1993 compared to $30.9 million in
1992.  The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on debt, offset by
less capitalized interest.

1994 FINANCIAL CHANGES  The Company's cash and marketable securities portfolio
increased by $4 million during 1994.  Operating activities provided $144 million
of cash in 1994.  Additional cash was provided by $104 million in new long-term
debt and $25 million in short-term borrowings.  Cash was used for the purchase
of four new MD-83 aircraft, one previously leased B737-400, one used B737-200C
aircraft, and other capital expenditures ($189 million), the repayment of debt
($71 million), and the repayment of short-term borrowings ($20 million).

Like many airlines, the Company has a working capital deficit.  The deficit
increased during 1994 due to the cash purchase of two aircraft and an increase
in current portion of capital lease obligations.  The existence of a working
capital deficit has not in the past impaired the Company's ability to meet its
obligations as they become due and it is not expected to do so in the future.

Financing Arrangements  During 1994, four MD-83 aircraft were financed under
ten-year loan agreements which bear interest at rates which vary based on
LIBOR.  The principal amount financed was $104 million.  In addition, capital
lease obligations increased $57.9 million due to changes in the lease
agreements for two B737-400 aircraft that were previously classified as
operating leases.

During early 1995, Alaska's lines of credit (which totalled $70 million) were
replaced with a $75 million credit facility with commercial banks.  Advances
under the new facility may either be for up to a 364-day term, or up to a
maximum maturity of three years.  Borrowings may be used for aircraft
acquisitions and other corporate purposes and they bear interest at a rate which
varies based on LIBOR.

Commitments  During 1994, Alaska took delivery of six new B737-400 aircraft
under operating leases and restructured all 20 of its B737-400 aircraft leases.
As part of the restructuring, Alaska purchased one of the 20 aircraft in 1994,
agreed to purchase one each in 1995 and 1996, and received options to purchase
up to four more of the 20 between 1997 and 1999.  The fixed term of the leases
was increased from eight years to ten years.  As a result of the restructuring,
Alaska expects to save more than $6 million per year over the term of the
leases.  Also during 1994, Alaska further restructured its aircraft orders with
McDonnell Douglas, replacing an order for ten MD-90s plus options with an order
for four MD-83s.  This restructuring will reduce future capital spending by $360
million.

During 1994, Horizon took delivery of seven new Dornier 328 aircraft under 15-
year operating leases, and five used Fokker F-28 aircraft under three-year
operating leases.

At December 31, 1994, the Company had firm orders for 17 aircraft with a total
cost of approximately $293 million as set forth below.

Cost (Millions)                   $78      $85      $85    $45     $293

Operating leases have been completed for the Dornier 328 orders.  The Company
expects to finance the other aircraft through new long-term debt and internally
generated cash.

The Company accrues the costs associated with returning leased aircraft over the
lease period.  At December 31, 1994, $26 million was reserved for leased
aircraft returns.

Deferred Taxes  At December 31, 1994, net deferred tax liabilities were $19
million, which includes $82 million of net temporary differences, offset by $38
million of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and $25 million of Alternative
Minimum Tax (AMT) credit carryforwards.  The Company believes that all of its
deferred tax assets, including the NOL and AMT credit carryforwards, will be
realized through the reversal of existing temporary differences or tax planning
strategies such as the sale of aircraft.

1993 FINANCIAL CHANGES  Cash and marketable securities increased by $18 million
in 1993.  Operations generated $49 million, proceeds from aircraft financing
were $84 million, and short-term borrowings added $20 million.  Cash was used
for the repayment of debt ($79 million), the repurchase of preferred stock ($33
million), and capital expenditures ($30 million).  During 1993, the Company
repurchased all of its outstanding redeemable preferred stock for $60 million,
saving the Company more than $4 million annually after taxes.  The seller
provided a $27 million loan to assist with the stock purchase.

1992 FINANCIAL CHANGES  Despite the $84.8 million net loss, operating activities
provided $20 million of cash in 1992.  During 1992, capital spending totaled
$278 million for six MD-83 and two B737-400 aircraft, other equipment and
deposits for future flight equipment.  These capital expenditures were financed
through debt ($47 million), sale/leasebacks ($215 million) and internally
generated cash.

EFFECT OF INFLATION  Inflation and specific price changes do not have a
significant effect on the Company's operating revenues, operating expenses and
operating income, because such revenues and expenses generally reflect current
price levels.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Alaska Air Group, Inc.
December 31, 1994


Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alaska Air Group,
Inc. (Company or Air Group) and its subsidiaries, the principal subsidiaries
being Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).
All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated.

Both subsidiaries operate as airlines.  However, each subsidiary's business
plan, competition and economic risks differ substantially due to the passenger
capacity and range of aircraft operated.  Alaska is a major airline, operates an
all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is 850 miles.  Horizon is a
regional airline, operates both jet and turboprop aircraft, and its average
passenger trip is 210 miles.  See Note 10 for business segment information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less. They are carried at cost, which approximates market.

Inventories and Supplies
Expendable and repairable aircraft parts, as well as materials and supplies, are
stated at average cost.  For repairable parts, an allowance for obsolescence is
accrued on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
aircraft.  Inventories related to the retired B727 fleet are carried at net
realizable value.  The allowance at December 31, 1994 and 1993 for all
inventories was $12.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively.
Property, Equipment and Depreciation
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-
line method over their estimated useful lives, which are as follows:

Aircraft and other
 flight equipment                  8-20 years
Buildings                          10-30 years
Capitalized leases and
 leasehold improvements            Term of lease
Other equipment                    3-15 years

Assets and related obligations for items financed under capital leases are
initially recorded at an amount equal to the present value of the future minimum
lease payments.

The cost of major airframe overhauls, engine overhauls, and other modifications
which extend the life or improve the usefulness of aircraft are capitalized, and
amortized over their estimated period of use.  Other repair and maintenance
costs are expensed when incurred.

Capitalized Interest
Interest is capitalized on flight equipment purchase deposits and ground
facilities progress payments as a cost of the related asset and is depreciated
over the estimated useful life of the asset.  Interest capitalization is
suspended when there is a substantial delay in aircraft deliveries.

Intangible Assets-Subsidiaries
The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is
recorded as an intangible asset and is amortized over 40 years.  Accumulated
amortization at December 31, 1994 and 1993 was $17 million and $15 million,
respectively.

Deferred Income
Deferred income results from the sale and leaseback of aircraft, the receipt of
manufacturer or vendor credits, and from the sale of foreign tax benefits.  This
income is recognized over the term of the applicable agreements.

Passenger Revenues
Passenger revenues are considered earned at the time transportation service is
provided.  Tickets sold but not yet used are included in air traffic liability.

Frequent Flyer Awards
Alaska operates a frequent flyer award program that provides travel awards to
members based on accumulated mileage.  The estimated incremental cost of
providing free travel is recognized as a liability and reported as expense as
miles are accumulated.  Alaska also defers recognition of income on a portion of
the payments it receives from travel partners associated with its frequent flyer
program.  The incremental cost liability and deferred partner revenues are
relieved as travel awards are used.

Income Taxes
In January 1992, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (FAS 109),
"Accounting for Income Taxes," was adopted.  FAS 109 requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax
returns.

Earnings Per Share
Primary earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income after reduction
for preferred stock dividends by the average number of common shares and
dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding.  Common stock equivalents result
from the assumed exercise of stock options.  Fully diluted earnings per share
gives effect to the conversion of convertible debt (after elimination of related
interest expense, net of income tax effect).

Derivative Financial Instruments
The differential to be paid or received on interest rate swap agreements is
accrued as interest rates change and is recognized currently in the income
statement.  The Company enters into hedge agreements to reduce its exposure to
fluctuations in the price of jet fuel.  A gain or loss is recorded quarterly if
the fuel index average exceeds the ceiling price or falls below the floor price.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years' financial statements to
conform to the 1994 presentation.

Note 2.       Marketable Securities
Marketable securities are investments that are readily convertible to cash, but
whose original maturity dates exceed three months.  They are classified as
available for sale and consisted of the following at December 31 (in thousands):

Note 3. Other Assets
Other assets consisted of the following at December 31 (in thousands):

                             1994          1993
Restricted deposits       $66,858       $60,903

                         $118,120      $102,447

Leasehold rights and deferred costs are amortized over the term of the related
lease or contract.  At December 31, 1994, deferred costs include $6.2 million
of capitalized training costs associated with the B737-400 aircraft.  These
costs are being amortized over a five-year period which began in April 1992.

Note 4.    Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations
At December 31, 1994 and 1993, long-term debt and capital lease obligations
were as follows (in thousands):

* weighted average for 1994

At December 31, 1994, borrowings of $362.4  million are secured by flight
equipment and real property.

During 1994, the Company repurchased $6.4 million of its 7-3/4% and 6-7/8%
convertible subordinated debentures for a $1.1 million pretax gain.  The
remaining 7-3/4% and 6-7/8% debentures are convertible into common stock at
$28.25 and $33.60 per share, respectively, subject to adjustments in certain
events.  Also, during 1994, the Company repurchased 55,922 of its 7-1/4% notes,
which had a book value of $24.3 million, for a $1.0 million pretax gain.  Each
of the remaining notes can be converted into 12.4 shares of common stock.
Holders of these notes have a put option to require the Company to purchase
each note on April 18, 1996 at their then accreted value of $490.58.  The
Company may elect to pay in cash or shares of common stock or in any
combination thereof.

At December 31, 1994, Alaska had $70 million in lines of credit, none of which
were being used, with commercial banks.  In early 1995, these credit agreements
were replaced with a $75 million credit facility with commercial banks.
Advances under the new facility may either be for up to a 364-day term, or up to
a maximum maturity of three years.  Borrowings may be used for aircraft
acquisitions or other corporate purposes, and they bear interest at a rate which
varies based on LIBOR.

Certain Alaska loan agreements contain provisions that require maintenance of
specific levels of net worth, leverage and fixed charge coverage, and limit
dividends, investments, lease obligations, sales of assets and additional
indebtedness.  At December 31, 1994, the Company was in compliance with all loan
provisions, and under the most restrictive loan provisions, Alaska had $28.5
million of net worth above the minimum.
During 1994, four MD-83 aircraft were financed with $104 million in ten-year
loans at variable interest rates based on LIBOR.  In addition, capital lease
obligations increased $57.9 million due to changes in the lease agreements for
two B737-400 aircraft that were previously classified as operating leases.

At December 31, 1994, long-term debt principal payments for the next five years
were (in thousands):
1995                     $ 40,762
1996*                    $ 37,621
1997                     $ 34,795
1998                     $ 35,736
1999                     $ 35,967
*    Excludes the effect of a put option on the 7-1/4% notes.

Note 5. Commitments
Lease Commitments
Lease contracts for 109 aircraft have remaining lease terms of one to 18
years.  The majority of airport and terminal facilities are also leased.
Total rent expense was $196.9 million, $180.4 million and $149.7 million,
in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Future minimum lease payments under
capital leases and long-term operating leases as of December 31, 1994 are

The Company has firm orders for 11 Dornier 328s to be delivered between
1995 and 1998, and six MD-83s to be delivered between 1995 and 1997.  The
total amount of these commitments is approximately $293 million.  As of
December 31, 1994, deposits related to the future equipment deliveries were
$43.2 million.  The manufacturer has agreed to provide lease financing for
all of the Dornier 328s.  In addition to the ordered aircraft, the Company
holds purchase options on 40 Dornier 328s.

Note 6. Stock Plans
Air Group has three stock option plans, which provide for the purchase of
Air Group common stock at its market price on the date of grant by certain
officers and key employees of Air Group and its subsidiaries.  Under the
plans, the incentive and nonqualified stock options granted have terms of
up to approximately ten years.  Up to half of the options provide for stock
appreciation rights.

Changes in the number of shares subject to option are summarized as
follows:
                             1994          1993           1992

(b)    Options exercisable at year end 1994 expire between June 1995 and
       June 2004.

In addition, 2,273,700 shares of common stock are subject to
nontransferable investment options held by management employees, for which
the Company received $3.1 million, which is included with other liabilities
on the Balance Sheet.  These options are subject to mandatory redemption at
$3.1 million in February 1997, and they allow the holder to purchase common
stock at $27 per share until that date.

Note 7. Employee Benefit Plans
Pension Plans
Four defined benefit and five defined contribution retirement plans cover
various employee groups of Alaska and Horizon.  The defined benefit plans
provide benefits based on an employee's term of service and average
compensation for a specified period of time before retirement.  Pension
costs are funded as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 (ERISA).

The defined benefit plan assets are primarily invested in common stocks and
fixed income securities.  Plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit
obligation at December 31, 1994 and 1993.  The following table sets forth
the funded status of the plans at December 31, 1994 and 1993 (in
thousands):

                                      1994                 1993

Plan assets at fair value       $  144,102             $145,974
Projected benefit obligation       147,200              159,529
Plan assets less projected
 benefit obligation                 (3,098)             (13,555)
Unrecognized transition asset       (1,374)              (1,658)
Unrecognized prior service cost      3,521                1,576
Unrecognized loss                   15,839               26,684
Prepaid pension cost            $   14,888              $13,047

The weighted average discount rate used to determine the projected benefit
obligation was 9.0% and 7.9% as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The calculation also assumed a 5.2% weighted average rate of
increase for future compensation levels for 1994 and 1993.  The expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets used in 1994 and 1993 was 10%.

Net pension expense for the defined benefit plans included the following
components for 1994, 1993 and 1992 (in thousands):

                              1994            1993          1992
Service cost (benefits
 earned during the
 period)                   $12,351         $10,041        $8,395

The defined contribution plans are deferred compensation plans under
section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Some of these plans require
Company matching contributions based on a percentage of participants'
contributions.  One plan has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)
feature.  The ESOP owns Air Group common shares which are held in trust for
eligible employees.  The Company has recorded deferred compensation to
reflect the value of the shares not yet allocated to eligible employees'
accounts.  As these shares are allocated to employees, compensation expense
is recorded and deferred compensation is reduced.

Alaska and Horizon also maintain an unfunded, noncontributory benefit plan
for certain elected officers.  The present value of unfunded benefits for
this plan was accrued as of December 31, 1994 and 1993.

Total expense for all pension plans was $22.5 million, $19.8 million and
$18.8 million,  respectively, in 1994, 1993 and 1992.

Profit Sharing Plans
Alaska and Horizon have employee profit sharing plans.  Profit sharing
expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $3.6 million, $2.3 million and $1.6
million, respectively.

Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company allows retirees to continue their medical, dental and vision
benefits by paying the respective active employee plan premium until age
65.  This results in a subsidy to retirees because the premiums received by
the Company are less than the actual cost of the retirees' claims.

Effective January 1, 1992, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," was adopted.  The new standard requires that the cost of
postretirement employee benefits other than pensions be recognized during
an employee's active service period.  Prior to 1992, the cost of these
benefits was expensed as claims were incurred.  The cumulative effect of
the accounting change for years prior to January 1, 1992 was an after-tax
charge of $4.6 million.

The following table sets forth the status of the postretirement benefit
obligation at December 31, 1994 and 1993 (in thousands):

                                    1994      1993
Accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO):

 Active plan participants

Unrecognized prior service cost     (326)     (381)
Unrecognized actuarial gain        3,244       980
Accrued postretirement
 benefit cost                   $ 10,439    $9,492

The Company's APBO is unfunded.  Net annual postretirement benefit costs
for 1994, 1993 and 1992 include the following components (in thousands):

                             1994       1993      1992

Net postretirement
 benefit cost              $1,266     $1,208    $1,498

An 8.5% health care cost trend rate was assumed for 1995.  The rate was
assumed to decrease by 1/2% annually to 5.5% for 2001 and remain at that
level thereafter.  Increasing the rate by 1 percentage point in each year
would increase the APBO as of December 31, 1994 by $1.1 million and the net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1994 by $228,000.  The weighted-
average discount rates used in determining the APBO for 1994 and 1993 were
9.0% and 7.9%, respectively.


Note 8. Special Charges
Results for 1993 and 1992 include special charges of $15 million and $26
million, respectively, to recognize an impairment of the value of the
Boeing B727 fleet.  The special charges include reserves for future excess
lease costs and the write-down of capitalized overhauls and spare parts to
net realizable value.

Note 9. Income Taxes
The components of income tax expense (credit) were as follows (in
thousands):

                             1994               1993            1992

Cash and cash equivalents          $27,179             $27,179
Marketable securities               73,970              73,889
Restricted deposits                 60,903              75,000
Long-term receivables                7,683               7,683
Long-term debt                     527,273             521,000

The fair value of cash equivalents approximates carrying value due to the
short maturity of these instruments.  The fair value of marketable
securities is based on quoted market prices.  The fair values of
restricted deposits and long-term receivables approximate the carrying
amounts.  The fair value of publicly traded long-term debt is based on
quoted market prices, and the fair value of other debt approximates
carrying value.

During 1993, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
reduce the interest expense on a portion of its fixed rate debt.  The
agreement, which expires in 1996, effectively changes the Company's
interest rate on the debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on
LIBOR.  Variable interest payments are paid to a financial institution semi-
annually based on a notional principal amount of $201 million.  In 1996,
the Company will receive a $33.2 million payment from the financial
institution.  At December 31, 1994, $18.3 million of this amount is shown
as a receivable in other assets.  The Company is exposed to higher
interest payments if LIBOR increases and is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by the financial institution.  Through December
31, 1994, this swap has resulted in a $1.1 million reduction in interest
expense.

The Company enters into hedge agreements to reduce its exposure to
fluctuations in the price of jet fuel.  The agreements establish a ceiling
price and floor price, and they provide for quarterly measurements of the
average price of fuel, as determined by an index.  The Company records a
gain or loss if a quarterly average exceeds the ceiling or falls below the
floor.  The fuel hedges had no material effect on 1994 operating results.
At December 31, 1994, the Company had a fuel hedge agreement in place with
a ceiling price of 65 cents covering approximately 50% of the expected fuel
usage through July 1995, and a floor price of 44 cents covering
approximately 50% of the expected fuel usage through July 1995.  At
December 31, 1994, the fuel index was at 50 cents.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alaska Air Group, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Alaska Air
Group, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Alaska Air Group, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in Item 14(a)
is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial statements.  This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states
in all material respects the financial data required to be set forth
therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
