PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Background

As used in this report, except where the context indicates otherwise, the
term “Company” or “Moody’s” refers to Moody’s Corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. The Company’s executive offices are located at 99 Church Street,
New York, NY 10007 and its telephone number is (212) 553-0300.

Prior to September 30, 2000, the Company operated as part of The Dun &
Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”). On September 8, 2000, the Board of
Directors of Old D&B approved a plan to separate into two publicly traded
companies – the Company and The New D&B Corporation (“New D&B”). On September
30, 2000, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders all of the outstanding shares
of New D&B common stock (the “2000 Distribution”). In connection with the
Distribution, Old D&B changed its name to Moody’s Corporation.

New D&B is the accounting successor to Old D&B, which was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 8, 1998. Old D&B began
operating as an independent publicly-owned corporation on July 1, 1998 as a
result of its June 30, 1998 spin-off (the “1998 Distribution”) from the
corporation now known as “R.H. Donnelley Corporation” and previously known as
“The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation” (“Donnelley”). Old D&B became the accounting
successor to Donnelley at the time of the 1998 Distribution.

Prior to the 1998 Distribution, Donnelley was the parent holding company
for subsidiaries then engaged in the businesses currently conducted by New D&B,
Moody’s and Donnelley. Prior to November 1, 1996, it also was the parent
holding company of subsidiaries conducting business under the names Cognizant
Corporation (“Cognizant”) and ACNielsen Corporation (“ACNielsen”). On that date
Donnelley effected a spin-off of the capital stock of Cognizant and ACNielsen
to its stockholders (the “1996 Distribution”). Cognizant subsequently changed
its name to Nielsen Media Research, Inc. in connection with its 1998 spin-off
of the capital stock of IMS Health Incorporated (“IMS Health”).

For purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between the
Company and New D&B after the Distribution and to provide for an orderly
transition, the Company and New D&B entered into various agreements including a
Distribution Agreement, Tax Allocation Agreement, Employee Benefits Agreement,
Shared Transaction Services Agreement, Insurance and Risk Management Services
Agreement, Data Services Agreement and Transition Services Agreement.

Detailed descriptions of the 1996, 1998 and 2000 Distributions are
contained in the Company’s 2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on March 15,
2001.

The Company

Moody’s is a leading global credit rating, research and risk analysis firm
in terms of market position, revenue, income and a number of other relevant
standards. Moody’s publishes credit opinions, research and ratings on
fixed-income securities, other credit obligations and issuers of securities.
Moody’s credit ratings and research help investors analyze the credit risks
associated with fixed-income securities. Credit ratings and research from
reliable third parties also create efficiencies in markets for fixed-income and
other obligations, such as insurance and derivatives, by providing reliable,
credible and independent assessments of credit risk. Moody’s global and
increasingly diverse services are designed to increase market liquidity and
efficiency and may reduce transaction costs.

Founded in 1900, Moody’s employs approximately 1,700 people worldwide.
Moody’s maintains offices in 17 countries and has expanded into developing
markets through joint ventures or affiliation agreements with local rating
agencies. Moody’s provides ratings and credit research on governmental and
commercial entities in approximately 100 countries. Moody’s customers include a
wide range of corporate and governmental issuers of securities as well as
investors, depositors, creditors, investment banks, commercial banks, and other
financial intermediaries. Moody’s is not dependent on a single customer or a
few customers, such that a loss of any one would have a material adverse effect
on its business.

Moody’s publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations.
These include various corporate and governmental obligations, structured
finance securities and commercial paper programs issued in domestic and
international markets. Moody’s also assigns ratings to issuers of securities,
insurance company obligations, bank loans, derivative products, bank deposits
and other bank debt, and managed funds. At the end of 2001, Moody’s had
provided credit ratings and analysis on more $30 trillion in debt, covering
approximately 85,000 securities, with more than 4,300 corporate relationships,
including industrial corporations, financial institutions, governmental
entities and structured finance issuers and over 72,000 public finance
obligations. Ratings are disseminated to the public through a variety of print
and electronic media, including the Internet and real-time systems widely used
by securities traders and investors.

Closely integrated with its ratings services, Moody’s provides research
services that are utilized by institutional investors and other credit
professionals. Clients of these services represent 2,800 institutions and
include over 20,000 users globally. Moody’s offers more than 100 research
products, covering areas such as investment grade and speculative grade corporate bonds,
the banking sector, municipal bonds, and mortgage- and asset-backed securities,
in cross-border and domestic markets worldwide. While research is delivered
through a number of channels, the majority of clients use Moody’s proprietary
Internet web site in order to have access to the Company’s ratings and research
products in a real-time environment.

Moody’s Risk Management Services, Inc. (“Moody’s Risk Management Services”
or “MRMS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Moody’s, develops and distributes
credit risk assessment software used by banks and other financial institutions
in their commercial lending, portfolio management, and other activities. MRMS
also provides modeling tools, analytics, credit education materials, seminars,
computer-based lending simulations and other products and services. The
products and services of MRMS have enabled it to develop continuing
relationships with its clients. In January 2000, MRMS acquired a financial
products software company, which provides credit risk assessment software to
financial institutions. This acquisition has been fully integrated into the
MRMS business.

In February 2002, Moody’s reached a definitive agreement to acquire KMV, a
market-based, quantitative credit risk management tools company, in an all
cash transaction for $210 million. Moody’s expects the transaction to close by
the early part of the second quarter of 2002 and initially to be funded by a
combination of cash on hand and its existing $160 million bank
credit lines.
The acquisition will expand the customer base and product offerings
of Moody’s credit risk assessment business.

Prospects for Growth

Over the past decade, global public and private fixed-income markets have
significantly increased in outstanding principal amount. Moody’s believes that
global debt capital markets will continue to increase in size and scope. In
addition, the securities being issued in the global fixed-income markets are
becoming more complex. Moody’s expects that these trends will provide continued
long-term demand for its high-quality, independent credit opinions.

The size of the world capital markets is increasing because, in general,
the global political and economic climate has promoted economic growth and more
productive capital investment and market structures. Despite the potential for
unfavorable cyclical conditions, Moody’s believes that the outlook is favorable
for the continued growth of world capital markets, particularly in Europe as a
consequence of economic and monetary union.

Technology, such as the Internet, makes information about investment
alternatives easily available throughout the world. This technology facilitates
issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national market and
investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their
national markets. Issuers and investors are also more readily able to obtain
information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that
they may wish to purchase or sell, many of which may be unfamiliar to them.
This availability of information promotes worldwide financial markets and a
greater need for credible and globally comparable ratings. As a result, a
number of new capital markets have emerged. In addition, more issuers and
investors are accessing traditional capital markets.

Another trend that is increasing the size of the world capital markets is
the ongoing disintermediation of financial systems. Issuers are increasingly
financing in the global public capital markets, rather than through traditional
financial intermediaries. Moreover, financial intermediaries are selling assets
in the global public capital markets, in addition to or instead of retaining
those assets. Structured finance securities markets for many types of assets
have developed in many countries and are contributing to these trends.

The complexity of capital market instruments is also growing.
Consequently, assessing the credit risk of such instruments becomes even more
of a challenge for financial intermediaries and asset managers. In the credit
markets, reliable third-party ratings represent an increasingly viable
alternative to traditional in-house research as the geographic scope and
complexity of financial markets grow.

Rating fees paid by issuers account for most of Moody’s revenue.
Therefore, a substantial portion of Moody’s revenues are dependent upon the
volume and number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets.
Moody’s is therefore affected by the performance of, and the prospects for, the
major world economies and by the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their
governments. However, annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers and
annual fees from commercial paper and medium-term note programs, bank and
insurance company financial strength ratings, mutual fund ratings and other
areas are less dependent on, or independent of, the volume or number of debt
securities issued in the global capital markets.

Moody’s operations are also subject to various politically related risks
inherent in carrying on business internationally. Such risks include currency
fluctuations and possible nationalization, expropriation, exchange and price
controls, changes in the availability of data from public sector sources,
limits on providing information across borders or other restrictive
governmental actions. Management believes that the risks of nationalization or
expropriation are reduced because its basic service is the creation and
dissemination of information, rather than the production of products that
require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources.

A key strategy for growth is to leverage our position as a leading brand
in financial services to develop new businesses. At present, an important brand
extension activity is being pursued by Moody’s Risk Management Services. By
providing tools for risk assessment on small and medium-sized companies, MRMS
extends Moody’s authority as an

-4-


evaluator of credit quality beyond our traditional core in the bond markets and
into the bank loan market. The planned acquisition of KMV, described
previously, will extend Moody’s product offerings in credit risk
assessment when completed.

Competition

Moody’s competes with other credit rating agencies and with investment
banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions, research and risk
analysis services. Institutional investors also have in-house credit research
capabilities. Moody’s most direct competitor in the global credit rating
business is Standard & Poor’s Credit Market Services (“S&P”), a division of The
McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. There are some rating markets, based on industry,
geography and/or instrument type, in which Moody’s has made investments and
obtained market positions superior to S&P’s. In other markets the reverse is
true.

Another rating agency competitor of Moody’s is Fitch, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Fimalac S.A. Fitch includes the former businesses of Duff &
Phelps, Fitch IBCA and Thomson BankWatch, which were recently combined in
merger transactions and acquisitions. Although Moody’s and S&P are each larger
than Fitch, competition is expected to increase from the combinations. One or
more significant rating agencies also may emerge in Europe over the next few
years in response to the growth in the European capital markets and development
of the European Monetary Union (“EMU”). In addition, local providers in
non-U.S. jurisdictions or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future
may receive support from local governments and other institutions.

Over the last decade, additional rating agencies have been established,
primarily in emerging markets and as a result of local capital market
regulation. Regulators worldwide have recognized that credit ratings can
further regulatory objectives for the development of public fixed-income
securities markets. The result of such regulatory activity has been the
creation of a number of primarily national rating agencies in various
countries. Certain of these regulatory efforts may have the unintended effect
of producing less credible ratings over time. Attempts to standardize ratings
systems or criteria may make all rating systems and agencies appear
undifferentiated, obscuring variations in the quality of the ratings providers.
In addition, since Moody’s believes that some of its most significant
challenges and opportunities will arise outside the United States, it will have
to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a
longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable
competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local
governments and other institutions.

Regulators of financial institutions are attempting to improve their
approach to supervision. They are shifting away from rule-based systems that
address only specific risk components and from institution-specific protections
towards other supervisory methods. The regulators’ evolving approach includes
their making qualitative judgments about the sophistication of each financial
institution’s risk management processes and systems, in terms of both market
and credit risk. Although such regulatory trends present opportunities for the
use of Moody’s ratings, they may also result in additional competition for
Moody’s or increased regulatory involvement in Moody’s practices.

Credit rating agencies such as Moody’s also compete with other means of
managing credit risk, such as credit insurance and credit derivatives.
Competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk
also may pose a competitive threat to Moody’s.

Moody’s Strategy

Moody’s intends to focus on the following opportunities:

Expansion in Financial Centers. Moody’s serves its customers through its
global network of offices and business affiliations. Moody’s currently
maintains full-service rating and marketing operations in global financial
centers such as Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, Madrid, Milan, New York, Paris,
Singapore and Tokyo. Moody’s expects that its global network will position it
to benefit from the expansion in worldwide capital markets and thereby increase
revenue. Moody’s also expects that the growth of its ratings and
research activities as a consequence of financial market integration under EMU
will continue. Moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing
markets either directly or through joint ventures, including its affiliations
with Korea

-5-


Investors Service, which became a consolidated subsidiary in 2002 (see
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements), ICRA Limited (India) and
Magister Bankwatch Calificadora de Riesgo, SA (Argentina), or other means.

New Rating Products. Moody’s is pursuing numerous initiatives that expand
credit ratings from public fixed income securities markets to other sectors
with credit risk exposures. Moody’s has a committed effort to extend its credit
opinion franchise to the global bank counterparty universe through emerging
market ratings, including bank financial strength ratings. Insurance financial
strength ratings in the property and casualty, reinsurance, and life insurance
markets represent additional growth opportunities. Moody’s has also introduced
issuer ratings for corporations not active in the debt markets and a Rating
Assessment Service for issuers interested in a definitive Moody’s rating
opinion about hypothetical or potential financial developments related to such
issuer. As the loan and capital markets converge, Moody’s expects to continue
to expand its rating coverage of bank loans and project finance loans and
securities. Moody’s has also introduced equity mutual fund indices and style-based analytical tools for institutional managers
to assist in evaluating fund portfolio characteristics and their
performance. As part of our effort to continue adding value
in structured finance, we are introducing new services to enable investors to
monitor the performance of their investments. Moody’s introduced an enhanced
monitoring product for collateralized debt obligations in January 2002, and
plans to introduce additional enhancements in this and other asset classes
later in the year.

Internet-Enhanced Products and Services. Moody’s is expanding its use of
the Internet and other electronic media to enhance client service. Moody’s web
site provides clients with instant access to ratings data and credit analysis.
Internet delivery also enables Moody’s to provide services to more individuals
within a client organization than paper-based products and to offer
higher-value services because customers do not need to handle paper-based
reports. Moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase client
use of Moody’s services. Moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic
media to capitalize on these and other opportunities.

Additional Opportunities in Securitization. The repackaging of financial
assets has had a profound effect on the fixed-income markets. New patterns of
securitization are expected to emerge in the next decade. Although the bulk of
assets securitized in the past five years have been consumer assets owned by
banks, commercial assets — principally commercial mortgages, term receivables
and corporate loans — are now increasingly being securitized. Securitization
has evolved into a strategic corporate finance tool in the United States and
Europe and is evolving in Asia. Ongoing global development of non-traditional
financial instruments, such as derivatives, future flow securities, hybrids,
credit-linked bonds and catastrophe bonds should continue to support growth.

New Credit Risk Management Services. Moody’s will continue to provide
banks and other financial institutions with credit risk management services.
Moody’s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because
of recent proposals by international bank regulatory authorities to recognize
banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining
regulatory capital. The Company continues to make significant strides in
broadening the geographic scope of one of MRMS’ most important products,
country-specific models that predict private company default probabilities. In
Europe, models for Germany, Spain, and France were introduced in 2001; product
roll-outs are planned for Japan and Mexico in 2002. The planned
acquisition of KMV, described previously, will further extend
Moody’s product offerings in credit risk management services
when completed.

Expansion of Credit Research Products and Investment Analytic Tools.
Moody’s plans to continue to expand its research and analytic products by
producing and acquiring additional products through internal development and
arrangements with others.

Regulation

Moody’s is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. Moody’s has been designated as a Nationally Recognized
Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”) by the SEC. The SEC first applied the
NRSRO designation in 1975 to agencies whose credit ratings could be used to
determine net capital requirements for broker-dealers. Congress (in certain
mortgage-related legislation), the SEC (in its regulations under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act of 1940) and other
governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of NRSROs to

-6-


distinguish between, among other things, “investment grade” and “non-investment
grade” securities.

In December 1997, the SEC proposed regulations that would define the
criteria for designation as an NRSRO. The proposal states that the SEC would
require rating agencies to have each of the following attributes before it will
grant NRSRO status:

Moody’s does not believe that this proposal, if adopted, would have a
material adverse effect on its operations or financial position.

Recently, there has been discussion in the U.S.
regarding study of the regulation of credit rating agencies. For
example, in March 2002 the SEC stated that it intends to re-examine
the role of rating agencies in the U.S. securities markets and the
potential need for greater regulation.

Moody’s is also subject to regulation in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in
which it operates. In certain countries, governments may provide financial or
other support to local-based rating agencies. In addition, governments may from
time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or
procedures for evaluating local issuers.

The Basic Committee on Banking Supervision is preparing a new capital
adequacy framework to replace the framework adopted in 1998. Under this
framework as now proposed, ratings assigned by a credit rating agency would be
an alternative available to certain banks to determine the risk weights for
many of their credit exposures. The Basle Committee’s proposal would
institutionalize ratings of certain rating agencies as an alternative in the
credit measurement processes of internationally active financial institutions
and subject rating agencies to a broader range of oversight. Because the
content of the proposal is not yet finalized, Moody’s cannot predict at this
time the final form of any such regulation. However, Moody’s does not believe
that this proposal, if adopted in its present form, would materially affect its
financial position, its results of operations or the manner in which it
conducts its business.

Other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research
services has been considered from time to time by local, national and
multinational bodies and is likely to be considered in the future. If enacted,
any such legislation and regulation could significantly change the competitive
landscape in which Moody’s operates. Management of Moody’s cannot predict
whether these or any other proposals will be enacted or the ultimate impact on
the competitive position, financial position or results of operations of
Moody’s.

Intellectual Property

Moody’s owns and controls a variety of trade secrets, confidential
information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other
intellectual property rights that, in the aggregate, are of material importance
to Moody’s business. Management of Moody’s believes that each of the “Moody’s”
name and related names, marks and logos are of material importance to Moody’s.
Moody’s is licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property
rights owned and controlled by others, and, similarly, other companies are
licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights

-7-


owned and controlled by Moody’s. Moody’s considers its trademarks, service
marks, databases, software and other intellectual property to be proprietary,
and Moody’s relies on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret,
patent, non-disclosure and contract safeguards for protection.

The names of Moody’s products and services referred to herein are
trademarks, service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or
licensed to Moody’s or one or more of its subsidiaries.

Employees

As of December 31, 2001, the number of full-time equivalent employees of
Moody’s was approximately 1,700.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

The executive offices of Moody’s are located at 99 Church Street, New
York, New York, in a 297,000-square-foot property owned by Moody’s. Moody’s
operations are also conducted from 4 other U.S. offices and 16 non-U.S. office
locations, all of which are leased. These other properties are geographically
distributed to meet sales and operating requirements worldwide. These
properties are generally considered to be both suitable and adequate to meet
current operating requirements, and virtually all space is being utilized.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Moody’s is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, although the
outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the ultimate
liability of Moody’s in connection with such matters will not have a material
adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. In addition, Moody’s is involved in the following legal
proceedings.

Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”)

In addition to the matters referred to above, on July 29, 1996, IRI filed
a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, naming as defendants R.H.Donnelley Corporation (“Donnelley”),
ACNielsen Company, (a subsidiary of ACNielsen Corporation) and IMS
International Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant
Corporation). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other
defendants was a subsidiary of Donnelley.

The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws,
including purported violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The
complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a
claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These
claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited
(“SRG”). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed
to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach
that agreement.

IRI’s complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount
IRI
has asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI also seeks punitive damages
in an
unspecified amount.

On October 15, 1996, defendants moved for an order dismissing all claims
in the complaint. On May 6, 1997, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York issued a decision dismissing IRI’s claim of
attempted monopolization in the United States, with leave to replead within 60
days. The Court denied defendants’ motion with respect to the remaining claims
in the complaint. On June 3, 1997, defendants filed an answer denying the
material allegations in IRI’s complaint, and ACNielsen filed a counterclaim
alleging that IRI had made false and misleading statements about its services
and commercial activities. On July 7, 1997, IRI filed an Amended and Restated
Complaint repleading its alleged claim of monopolization in the United States
and realleging its other claims. By notice of motion dated August 18, 1997,
defendants moved for an order dismissing the amended claim. On December 1,
1997, the Court denied the motion. On December 22, 1999, defendants filed a
motion for partial summary judgment seeking to dismiss IRI’s non-U.S. antitrust
claims. On July 12, 2000, the Court granted the motion dismissing claims of
injury suffered from activities in foreign markets where IRI operates through
subsidiaries or companies owned by joint ventures or “relationships” with local
companies. Discovery in this case is ongoing.

In November 1996, Donnelley completed the 1996 Distribution. On October
28, 1996, in connection with the 1996 Distribution, Cognizant, ACNielsen and
Donnelley entered into the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. See Note 14
(Contingencies) in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for additional
information with respect to this agreement.

In June 1998, Donnelley completed the 1998 Distribution. In connection
with the 1998 Distribution, Old D&B and Donnelley entered into
an agreement (the “1998 Distribution Agreement”)
whereby Old D&B

-10-


assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and
agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities.

During 1998, Cognizant separated into two new companies, IMS Health and
Nielsen Media Research. IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research are each jointly
and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and
Joint Defense Agreement.

In September 2000, Old D&B completed the 2000 Distribution. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, New D&B and Moody’s entered into an agreement (the “2000 Distribution Agreement”) whereby  New D&B undertook to be
jointly and severally liable with Moody’s for Old D&B’s obligations to
Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities
relating to the IRI action. However, under the 2000 Distribution Agreement, as
between themselves, each of New D&B and Moody’s has agreed to be responsible
for 50% of any payments to be made in respect of the IRI action under the 1998
Distribution Agreement or otherwise, including any legal fees or expenses
related thereto.

Management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the IRI
action or whether the resolution of such matters could materially affect
Moody’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes

On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by
L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes (“AFPER”) against
Moody’s France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First
Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds
issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes
claims against Moody’s France SA and Standard & Poor’s SA for lack of diligence
and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER
alleges that, by failing to take into account the post-Revolutionary
repudiation of pre-Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in
rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating
agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the
old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several
liability, AFPER seeks damages of approximately $2.43 billion plus legal costs.
Moody’s believes that the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends
to vigorously contest the action.

ITEM 6.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The Company’s selected consolidated financial data should be read in
conjunction with “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” and the Moody’s Corporation
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Certain of the selected
financial data is derived from the unaudited consolidated financial
statements of Moody’s. In the opinion of management, these financial
statements include all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of such
data in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Company
were a separate entity for all periods presented. The financial data
included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations and
financial position of Moody’s in the future or what they would have been had
it been a separate entity.

Through September 30, 2000, Moody’s expenses included allocations of costs
from Old D&B for employee benefits, centralized services and other corporate
overhead. Expenses related to these services were allocated to Moody’s based
on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be
determined, based on Moody’s revenue in proportion to Old D&B’s total
revenue. Although Moody’s management believes these allocations are
reasonable, such allocated costs are not necessarily indicative of the
actual costs that would have been incurred if Moody’s had performed or
obtained these services as a separate entity. The allocations included in
expenses in the consolidated statements of operations were $13.3 million,
$17.2 million, $16.4 million and $15.8 million in 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. There were no such allocations in 2001.

(1)

The results of operations above include the following amounts related to
the Financial Information Services (“FIS”) business that was sold in July
1998: revenue of $18.4 million and $34.3 million in 1998 and 1997,
respectively, and operating income of $4.2 million and $5.8 million in 1998
and 1997, respectively. Included in non-operating (expense) income, net are
pre-tax gains on the sale of FIS of $9.2 million in 1999 and $12.6 million
in 1998.

(2)

Expenses in 2001 included unusual expenses of approximately $5.0 million
for severance, legal fees and other costs related to a settlement with the
Department of Justice in April 2001; $6.0 million related to charitable
contributions and initial funding for the newly formed Moody’s Foundation;
and $3.4 million for the write-down of investments in Argentine rating
agencies.

(3)

Non-operating (expense) income, net in 2001 and 2000 included $22.9
million and $5.8 million, respectively, of interest expense which
principally related to the $300 million of notes payable outstanding at
December 31, 2001 and 2000. These amounts were partially offset by interest
income on invested cash of $6.5 million in 2001 and $2.2 million in 2000.
Interest expense and income was immaterial in 1999, 1998 and 1997.

(4)

Represents the impact of a change in revenue recognition policies
whereby the Company began recognizing certain revenues over the service
period, instead of as previously recognized, at the time of billing.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this
Form 10-K.

The Company

Except where otherwise indicated, the terms “Moody’s” or “the Company” refer
to Moody’s Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Moody’s is a
leading global credit rating, research and risk analysis firm in terms of
market position, revenue, income and a number of other relevant standards.
The Company publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit
obligations. These include various corporate and governmental obligations,
structured finance securities and commercial paper programs, issued in
domestic and international markets. Moody’s also assigns ratings to issuers
of securities, insurance company obligations, bank loans, derivative
products, bank deposits and other bank debt and managed funds.

Closely integrated with its ratings services, Moody’s provides research
services that are utilized by institutional investors and other credit
professionals. Moody’s publishes more than 100 research products covering
areas such as investment grade and speculative grade corporate bonds, the
banking sector, municipal bonds and mortgage- and asset-backed securities,
in cross-border and domestic markets worldwide.

Moody’s Risk Management Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Moody’s
(“Moody’s Risk Management Services” or “MRMS”), develops and distributes
credit risk assessment software used by banks and other financial
institutions in their portfolio management, commercial lending and other
activities. Moody’s Risk Management Services also provides credit modeling
tools, analytics, credit education materials, seminars, computer-based
lending simulations and other products and services that have enabled it to
develop continuing relationships with its clients. In January 2000, MRMS
acquired a financial software products company that provided credit risk
assessment software to financial institutions. In February 2002, the Company
announced that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire KMV, a
market-based, quantitative credit risk management tools company, in an all
cash transaction for $210 million. Moody’s expects the transaction to close
by the early part of the second quarter of 2002 and initially to be funded
by a combination of cash on hand and its existing bank credit lines. The
acquisition will expand the customer base and product offerings of Moody’s
credit risk assessment business.

Factors Affecting Comparability

On September 30, 2000 (the “Distribution Date”), The Dun & Bradstreet
Corporation (“Old D&B”) separated into two independent, publicly traded
companies—Moody’s Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (“New D&B”). The
separation was accomplished through a tax-free distribution to the
shareholders of Old D&B of all of the shares of common stock of a newly
formed, wholly owned subsidiary, New D&B, which comprised the business of
Old D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company (“the D&B Business”). The
remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing
ratings and related research and risk management services (“the Moody’s
Business”) and was renamed “Moody’s Corporation.” Old D&B’s common stock
became Moody’s common stock, and shares of common stock of Old D&B represent
a continuing interest in the Moody’s Business. The financial statements of
Moody’s have been restated to reflect the recapitalization described above.
The method by which Old D&B distributed its shares is herein after referred
to as “the Distribution.”

In general, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement entered into
at the Distribution Date, all assets and liabilities of the D&B Business
were allocated to New D&B and all assets and liabilities of the Moody’s
Business were allocated to Moody’s. The net indebtedness of Old D&B at the
Distribution Date was allocated equally between the parties, before giving
effect to certain adjustments.

The consolidated financial statements of Moody’s Corporation reflect the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Moody’s as if it
were a separate entity for all periods presented. The financial statements
include allocations of certain Old D&B corporate headquarters assets and
liabilities that were transferred from Old D&B at the Distribution Date, as
well as allocations of certain expenses for employee benefits, centralized
services and corporate overhead that were provided by Old D&B prior to the
Distribution Date (see Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, for
additional information). The expense allocations were based on utilization
of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined,
based on Moody’s revenue in proportion to Old D&B’s total revenue.
Management believes these allocations are reasonable. However, the costs of
these services and benefits charged to Moody’s are not necessarily
indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if Moody’s had
performed or obtained these services as a separate entity.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of
operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported



amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Moody’s bases
its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis,
Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
recognition, accounts receivable allowances, deferred tax assets and
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, contingencies, valuation of
investments in affiliates, long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill,
and stock options. In addition, during 2001, Moody’s recorded estimated
insurance recoveries related to the impact of the September 11th tragedy.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. Below are descriptions of some of the judgments that Moody’s
makes in applying its accounting policies in these areas.

Revenue Recognition

In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moody’s uses judgments to match
billed revenue with services to be provided in the future. These judgments
are generally not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but
rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. Such areas
are discussed below.

•

Moody’s monitors its ratings on issuers and their outstanding
securities. In cases where the Company does not charge ongoing annual fees
or other monitoring fees for a particular issuer, the Company defers
portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring
activities and recognizes such fees over the estimated monitoring periods.
Deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 included approximately $15 million
related to estimated deferred monitoring fees.

•

Under the Company’s frequent issuer program (“FIP”) arrangements,
ratings customers pay a fixed annual fee regardless of issuance activity,
with reduced transaction fees as securities are issued and rated and an
overall cap on annual billings. Moody’s amortizes the fixed annual fees on a
straight-line basis over the contract period, which is generally one year.
As customers reach their annual billing caps, transaction fees are deferred
and prorated over the contract period to match revenue with future services
for which no further billings will be made. Deferred revenue at December 31,
2001 included approximately $2 million related to deferred FIP transaction
fees.

In addition, Moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for
which, in addition to a fixed annual fee, issuers are billed quarterly based
on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on
estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed in the following quarter when
actual data is available. At December 31, 2001, accounts receivable included
approximately $18 million of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically,
the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue
and the actual billings.

Accounts Receivable Allowances

Moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future
adjustments to customer billings, based on historical experience and current
conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts
receivable allowance and totaled approximately $29 million or 3.6% of
revenue in 2001. Adjustments to and write-offs of receivables are charged
against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its estimates on a regular basis
and makes adjustments to provision rates and the accounts receivable
allowance as considered appropriate.

Deferred Tax Assets and Undistributed Earnings of Non-U.S. Subsidiaries

In assessing the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances, Moody’s
considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax
planning strategies. Based on these assessments, Moody’s has determined that
it expects to be able to realize in the future its deferred tax assets,
which totaled $32.6 million at December 31, 2001. However, if Moody’s
profitability or other circumstances were to change adversely, the Company
could determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its
deferred tax assets in the future. In such case, a valuation allowance would
be established and an increase in the tax provision would result in the
period such determination was made.

In addition, the Company has approximately $26 million of undistributed
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been
provided. It is currently management’s intent to permanently re-invest those
earnings in its subsidiaries. If management’s approach to re-investing those
earnings changed or such earnings were distributed to the U.S., incremental
expense of approximately $1 million for U.S. federal and foreign income
taxes would be incurred.

Contingencies

Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the
“Contingencies” section of this management’s discussion and analysis,
requires the use of judgment and estimates in assessing their magnitude and
likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be
determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The
provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the
related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the current
status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the
facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel. Since the potential
exposure on many of these matters is material, resolution of these matters
in amounts that are different from what has been accrued in the consolidated
financial statements could have a material impact on Moody’s reported
results and financial position.



Investments in Affiliates, Long-Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Moody’s assesses the impairment of its investments in affiliates,
identifiable intangible and long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. This evaluation requires the use of judgment as to the effects
of external factors and market conditions on the Company’s conduct of its
operations, and it requires the use of estimates in projecting future
operating results. Based on such assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2001,
the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $3.4 million to write off a portion
of its equity investment in two Argentine rating agencies. If actual
external conditions or future operating results differ from the Company’s
judgments, impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value
of the Company’s investments in affiliates, long-lived and intangible assets
and goodwill.

Stock Options

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, the
Company has elected not to recognize in its consolidated financial
statements compensation expense related to options granted, and instead has
disclosed the related pro forma net income and earnings per share effects in
the notes to the financial statements. The stock option values that underly
the disclosures are based on assumptions and estimates that the Company
believes are reasonable. However, circumstances existing when options are
exercised could cause the actual cost of the options to differ from these
estimates.

In addition to the stock options outstanding at December 31, 2001, as
disclosed in Note 8, Stock Options, to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements, Moody’s granted approximately 3.5 million options in February
2002. Using what the Company believes are reasonable assumptions and the
Black-Scholes option pricing model, the estimated value of this grant was
$36 million, approximately 10% of Moody’s 2001 pre-tax income. The Company
has a policy of repurchasing its shares to offset the dilutive impacts of
stock option exercises, which will be an important use of its cash flow over
time. During 2001, approximately $24 million was spent on such repurchases
(after option proceeds and related tax benefits), which was approximately 9%
of the Company’s after-tax cash flow before dividends and share repurchases.

Insurance Recovery Estimates

As a result of the September 11th tragedy, Moody’s was displaced from its
New York City headquarters building for approximately two months. The
Company quickly restored operations and conducted its business from various
temporary office locations during its displacement. Incremental costs of
approximately $6.5 million were incurred during this period, principally
related to restoration of the building, use of temporary office facilities
and restoration of critical systems. Moody’s has filed for recovery of these
costs under its all-risk property and business interruption insurance
policy. The Company believes that a substantial portion of the costs will be
recovered and has reflected an appropriate receivable on its December 31,
2001 balance sheet; if such recovery were less than anticipated, a charge to
earnings would be made for the unrecovered amounts.

Operating Segments

Moody’s operates primarily in one reportable business segment: ratings,
which accounts for approximately 90% of the Company’s total revenue. The
ratings segment is composed of four ratings groups: corporate finance,
structured finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public
finance. Given the dominance of the ratings segment to Moody’s overall
results, the Company does not separately measure and report operating income
for the ratings business. Rather, revenue is the predominant measure
utilized by senior management for assessing performance and for the
allocation of resources, and operating income is evaluated for Moody’s as a
whole. Moody’s also reports revenue separately for two geographic areas:
U.S. and international. Revenue included in “Other” consists of research
revenue, generated from the sale of investor-oriented credit research, and
risk management services revenue, generated from the sale of credit risk
assessment software and related products and services.

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000

Moody’s revenue was $796.7 million in 2001, an increase of $194.4 million or
32.3% from $602.3 million in 2000. The increase reflected strong growth in
ratings revenue across all ratings groups. Other revenue reflected
double-digit growth in both Moody’s Risk Management Services and research
revenue.

Moody’s ratings revenue was $694.4 million in 2001, an increase of 33.6%
from $519.6 million in 2000. Strong double-digit growth in global structured
finance, European and U.S. corporate finance and public finance drove much
of the increase.

Structured finance ratings revenue of $273.8 million in 2001 grew 37.4% over
2000 revenue of $199.2 million. The increase was due to strong growth in the
U.S. across several market sectors including credit derivatives,
asset-backed securities and both commercial and residential mortgage-backed
securities. European structured finance was very strong due primarily to
asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and credit
derivatives.

Revenue from corporate finance ratings was $225.7 million in 2001 compared
with $162.7 million in 2000, an increase of 38.7%. Lower interest rates in
the U.S. resulted in strong issuance growth in both investment grade and
high yield bonds. The strong revenue growth also reflected the success of
Moody’s Rating Assessment Service, which was introduced in the second half
of 2000. In addition, new monitoring fees for infrequent issuers were



initiated in 2001, which produced approximately $9
million of revenue growth over 2000.

Revenue from financial institution and sovereign risk ratings was $130.7
million in 2001, an increase of 17.1% over $111.6 million in 2000. Lower
interest rates in the U.S. drove increased investment grade issuance for
banks and other financial institutions. In addition, revenue in Europe grew
at a double-digit pace due to lower borrowing costs.

Public finance ratings revenue grew 39.3% to $64.2 million in 2001, up from
$46.1 million in 2000. This was primarily due to a 43% increase in the
dollar volume of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2001 compared to 2000.
Refinancing activity was especially strong due to the favorable interest
rate environment, and represented 31% of total issuance dollar volume in
2001 versus 17% in 2000.

Other revenue increased $19.6 million, or 23.7%, to $102.3 million in 2001.
Moody’s Risk Management Services revenue grew 33.9% to $30.8 million, driven
by continued strong sales of its credit risk assessment software and
subscription products. Research revenue increased 19.8%, to $71.5 million,
reflecting continued international expansion, new product introductions and
growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet.

Revenue in the United States was $560.7 million in 2001, an increase of
30.7% over $428.9 million in 2000. This increase reflected strong growth in
ratings revenue, principally due to higher issuance volumes in most market
sectors, including investment grade and high yield corporate bonds,
municipal bonds, asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities. The
number of investment grade corporate issues was up more than 48% over 2000
and public finance issuance dollar volume grew by 43%. In U.S. structured
finance, asset-backed issuance volume was up 29%, residential mortgage
volume rose 130% and commercial mortgage volume was up 50%.

Moody’s international revenue was $236.0 million in 2001 compared to $173.4
million in 2000, an increase of 36.1%. European structured finance revenue
almost doubled for the year. International corporate finance revenue grew more
than 20% and financial institutions revenue showed solid double-digit growth.
International revenue at Moody’s Risk Management Services rose 46.1% and
non-U.S. research revenue grew 23.7%.

2001 operating expenses of $239.6 million grew 26.4% from $189.6 million in
2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to
an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in
worldwide structured finance, as well as higher incentive compensation costs
due to the Company’s very strong 2001 results. Also included in operating
expense was a $3.4 million charge to write down investments in Argentine
rating agencies, due to the recent currency devaluation and the unstable
economic and political situation. Selling, general and administrative
expenses of $141.6 million in 2001 were up 31.6% compared to $107.6 million
in 2000. This increase principally reflected higher incentive compensation
costs due to the Company’s very strong 2001 results, unusual costs of
approximately $5.0 million for severance, legal fees and other costs related
to the Company’s legal settlement with the Department of Justice in April
2001 and $6.0 million related to charitable contributions and initial
funding for the newly formed Moody’s Foundation. Depreciation and
amortization expense increased from $16.6 million in 2000 to $17.0 million
in 2001.

Moody’s operating income of $398.5 million in 2001 was up 38.1% from $288.5
million in 2000. Due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the
year, the Company’s 2001 operating margin was 50%, up from 48% a year
earlier and above our long-term target of 48%.

Non-operating expense increased to $16.6 million in 2001 from $4.5 million
in 2000. This was principally the result of a full year of interest expense
related to the Company’s private debt placement that was completed in the
fourth quarter of 2000, offset in part by interest income on invested cash.

Moody’s effective tax rate was 44.4% for 2001 compared to 44.2% for 2000.

Reported net income was $212.2 million in 2001 compared to $158.5 million in
2000, an increase of 33.9%. Basic earnings per share were $1.35 in 2001 and
$0.98 in 2000, an increase of 37.8%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.32
in 2001 and $0.97 in 2000, an increase of 36.1%. On a pro forma basis,
including interest expense on the private placement debt (and excluding any
interest income) for both periods, diluted earnings per share would have
been $1.30 for 2001 compared with $0.91 for 2000, a gain of 42.9%.

Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 1999

Moody’s revenue was $602.3 million in 2000, an increase of $38.1 million or
6.8% from $564.2 million in 1999. The increase reflected modest growth in
ratings revenue, with strong gains in global structured finance ratings,
partially offset by the impact of declines in several sectors of the U.S.
market. Other revenue reflected strong growth in Moody’s Risk Management
Services, primarily related to the acquisition of a financial software
products company in January 2000. It also reflected double-digit growth in
research revenue, driven by international expansion, new product
introductions and growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet.

Moody’s ratings revenue was $519.6 million in 2000, an increase of 3.5% from
$502.2 million in 1999. Strong growth in global structured finance and
international corporate finance was partially offset by the effects of a
decline in securities issuance in the U.S. capital markets.

Structured finance ratings revenue of $199.2 million in 2000 grew 15.5% over
1999 revenue of $172.4 million. The increase in



revenue was principally the result of strong growth in the asset-backed and
derivatives markets in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Moody’s revenue from
ratings of U.S. credit derivatives grew by 12% in 2000, as the number of
collateralized debt obligations that Moody’s rated increased by 14%.

Revenue from corporate ratings was $162.7 million in 2000 compared with
$165.5 million in 1999, a decline of 1.7%. Revenue from high yield ratings
declined in 2000, as the number of issues during the year was 55% lower than
in 1999. This impact was substantially offset by revenue from new European
issuers and double-digit growth in bank loan ratings revenue.

Revenue from financial institution and sovereign risk ratings was $111.6
million in 2000, an increase of 6.5% over $104.8 million in 1999. Growth in
2000 reflected 21% volume growth in international bond and medium-term note
issuance, somewhat offset by the negative effects of a decline in U.S. debt
issuance and U.S. industry consolidation in this sector.

Public finance ratings revenue declined 22.5% to $46.1 million in 2000, from
$59.5 million in 1999. The decrease was principally the result of a 16%
decline in the number of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2000 compared to
1999.

Other revenue increased 33.4% to $82.7 million in 2000, reflecting
double-digit growth in research revenue due to strong demand for products
delivered via the Internet and increased international sales. In addition,
Moody’s Risk Management Services revenue more than doubled compared to 1999,
primarily due to the acquisition of a financial software products company in
January 2000.

Revenue in the United States was $428.9 million in 2000, an increase of 1.3%
over $423.4 million in 1999. Ratings revenue declined 1% compared to the
prior year, as the effects of lower issuance levels in the core corporate
and public finance sectors were substantially offset by strong growth in
asset-backed finance, credit derivatives and bank loan ratings. Double-digit
revenue growth was achieved in Moody’s Risk Management Services and research
revenue.

Moody’s international revenue was $173.4 million in 2000 versus $140.8
million in 1999, an increase of 23.2%. This performance was principally
driven by strong growth in ratings of international structured finance
securities, particularly in Europe and Japan, and an increased number of
European corporate issuers. Strong growth was achieved in international
research revenue, reflecting new products and geographic expansion, and in
Moody’s Risk Management Services revenue.

2000 operating expenses of $189.6 million grew 3.3% from $183.6 million in
1999. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to
an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in
worldwide structured finance. This growth was partially offset by cost
containment efforts in light of low revenue growth in the U.S. and lower
production and delivery costs due to conversion of research products to
Internet delivery. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $107.6
million in 2000 were up 10.7% compared to $97.2 million in 1999. This
increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to
support international business expansion, increased corporate overhead costs
resulting from becoming a separate public company and higher sales related
costs in the risk management services business. Depreciation and
amortization expense increased from $13.0 million in 1999 to $16.6 million
in 2000, principally reflecting amortization of goodwill and intangible
assets related to the previously mentioned acquisition.

Moody’s operating income of $288.5 million in 2000 was up 6.7% from $270.4
million in 1999. Non-operating expense of $4.5 million in 2000 principally
reflected interest expense related to Moody’s private debt placement that
was completed in the fourth quarter, offset in part by interest income on
invested cash. Non-operating income of $8.5 million in 1999 principally
reflected a $9.2 million gain related to the 1998 sale of the Company’s
Financial Information Services business (“FIS”).

Moody’s effective tax rate was 44.2% for both 2000 and 1999.

Reported net income was $158.5 million in 2000 compared with $155.6 million
in 1999, an increase of 1.9%. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2000
were $0.98 and $0.97, respectively, compared to $0.96 and $0.95,
respectively, in 1999. Excluding the 1999 gain related to the sale of FIS,
and including interest expense on the private placement debt (but excluding
any interest income) for both periods, diluted earnings per share would have
been $0.91 in 2000 compared with $0.84 in 1999, an increase of 8.3%.

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 1998

Moody’s revenue was $564.2 million in 1999, an increase of 9.8% from $513.9
million in 1998. Revenue in 1998 included $18.4 million related to FIS,
which was sold in July 1998. Excluding FIS, Moody’s 1999 revenue grew 13.9%
from $495.5 million in 1998. The strong revenue performance reflected
double-digit growth in ratings revenue, fueled by continued expansion of
European capital markets and growth in several sectors of the U.S. market.
Moody’s 1999 revenue also reflected double-digit growth in research revenue,
driven by international expansion and new product introductions.

Moody’s ratings revenue was $502.2 million in 1999, an increase of 13.7%
from $441.5 million in 1998. This growth was principally driven by ratings
of corporate bonds, structured finance products and commercial paper.
International ratings revenue growth was especially strong, as the
introduction of the Euro and a significant increase in merger-related
financing drove significant growth in European capital markets. These
revenue gains were partially offset by the effects of volume declines in the
U.S. high yield and municipal markets, compared to strong performance in
these markets in 1998.



Structured finance ratings revenue of $172.4 million in
1999 grew 20.6% over 1998 revenue of $143.0 million. The increase in 1999
revenue was principally the result of strong growth in the asset-backed and
derivatives markets in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Moody’s revenue from ratings
of U.S. credit derivatives grew by more than 40% in 1999, as issuance volumes
surged to record levels.

Revenue from corporate ratings was $165.5 million in 1999 compared with
$143.6 million in 1998, an increase of 15.3%. The revenue growth was
principally driven by strong international issuance volumes. U.S. bank loan
ratings activity expanded significantly in 1999 as Moody’s rated more than
$300 billion of new loans, an increase of 50% over 1998. Revenue from high
yield ratings declined in 1999, as issuance dollar volume during the year
was approximately 32% lower than 1998’s record level.

Revenue from financial institution and sovereign risk ratings was $104.8
million in 1999, an increase of 16.3% over $90.1 million in 1998. The
increase principally reflected higher debt issuance in and expanded coverage
of the global banking sector.

Public finance ratings revenue declined 8.2% to $59.5 million in 1999 from
$64.8 million in 1998. The decrease was principally the result of lower
municipal debt issuance in 1999 following 1998’s near-record level.

Revenue in the United States was $423.4 million in 1999, an increase of 2.5%
over $413.0 million in 1998. Excluding the 1998 revenue of FIS, United
States revenue increased 7.1% in 1999, from $395.3 million in 1998. This
increase was principally the result of gains in structured finance,
commercial paper and bank loan ratings, partially offset by the effects of
volume declines in the high yield and municipal markets.

Moody’s international revenue was $140.8 million in 1999 versus $100.9
million in 1998, an increase of 39.5%. Excluding the 1998 revenue of FIS,
international revenue increased 40.5% in 1999 from $100.2 million in 1998.
This performance was principally driven by growth in European capital
markets, where the introduction of the Euro and a significant increase in
merger-related financing drove strong debt issuance. Strong growth was also
achieved in ratings of international asset-backed securities, particularly
in Europe and Japan.

1999 operating expenses of $183.6 million grew $6.3 million, or 3.6%, from
$177.3 million in 1998. Excluding 1998 operating expense of $8.5 million
related to FIS, 1999 operating expense increased by $14.8 million, or 8.8%.
The increase principally reflected higher compensation and related expenses
due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and the
structured finance business. Selling, general and administrative expenses of
$97.2 million in 1999 were up $1.5 million compared to $95.7 million in
1998. Excluding $4.6 million of 1998 selling, general and administrative
expenses related to FIS, 1999 expense grew by $6.1 million, or 6.7%. This
increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $13.0 million in 1999, a decrease
of $2.4 million from 1998. Excluding FIS depreciation and amortization
expense of $1.1 million in 1998, the 1999 expense declined by $1.3 million.
This reflected lower levels of capital spending in 1998 and 1999 versus
prior years, partly
as a result of declining technology costs.

Moody’s operating income of $270.4 million in 1999 was up 19.9% from $225.5
million in 1998. Excluding 1998 operating income related to FIS of $4.2
million, 1999 operating income grew 22.2% from $221.3 million in 1998.

Non-operating income, net, was $8.5 million in 1999 and $12.4 million in
1998. Non-operating income included pre-tax gains related to the sale of FIS
of $9.2 million in 1999 and $12.6 million in 1998.

Moody’s effective tax rate was 44.2% for 1999, compared with 40.3% in 1998.
The change resulted from an increase in the percentage of Moody’s income
allocable to states with high income tax rates and refinements of certain
estimates.

Moody’s reported net income was $155.6 million in 1999 versus $142.0 million
in 1998, an increase of 9.6%. Basic and diluted earnings per share in 1999
were $0.96 and $0.95, respectively, compared with basic and diluted earnings
per share of $0.84 and $0.83, respectively, in 1998. Moody’s results
included after-tax gains related to the sale of FIS of $5.1 million ($0.03
per basic and diluted share) in 1999 and $7.5 million ($0.04 per basic and
diluted share) in 1998. Excluding these gains, Moody’s 1999 net income of
$150.5 million increased 11.9% or $16.0 million over $134.5 million in 1998.

Market Risk

Moody’s maintains operations in 16 countries outside the United States and
over 90% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was billed and
collected in U.S. dollars. Approximately 25% of the Company’s expenses were
incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, the Company is
exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates.

As of December 31, 2001, approximately 12% of Moody’s assets were located
outside the U.S. Of Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $163.2
million at December 31, 2001, approximately $34 million was located outside
the United States (with $28 million in the U.K.), making the Company
susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effect of changes
in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and
liabilities of non-U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative
translation adjustment in shareholders’ equity.

Cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade
securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company
limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer. The Company manages its
credit risk exposure by allocating its



cash equivalents
among various money market mutual funds, short-term certificates of deposit
or issuers of high-grade commercial paper.

The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor
does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, going
forward, the Company will assess the need to enter into hedging transactions
to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities was $306.3 million, $67.6 million,
and $197.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2001 increased
substantially compared with 2000 reflecting, among other things, the $174.6
million income tax-related payment in 2000 that is described later in this
section and year-to-year growth in Moody’s net income of $53.7 million in
2001. In addition, the 2001 increase reflected a deferral of approximately
$50 million of U.S. federal income taxes that normally would have been paid
during the year; such taxes were paid in January 2002. Moody’s accrued
liabilities at December 31, 2001 were $101.5 million higher than at December
31, 2000. In addition to the impact of the income tax deferral, the increase
reflected higher accruals for incentive compensation, which were paid in the
first quarter of 2002. In addition, accounts receivable at year-end 2001
were $47.4 million higher than the prior year-end, reflecting the high level
of fourth quarter 2001 billings. It is anticipated that the majority of
these receivables will be collected in the first quarter of 2002. The
decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 compared to 1999
was primarily due to a payment of approximately $174.6 million, representing
Moody’s 50% share, in connection with an amended tax return filed by Old D&B
on May 12, 2000. In addition, payments for incentive compensation in 2000
were higher than in 1999. The $15.0 million increase in accounts receivable
in 2000 reflected strong growth in fourth quarter billings.

Net cash used in investing activities was $30.0 million, $33.6 million and
$12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The 2001 amount included $15.2 million of investments in
international rating agencies. The increase in cash used from 1999 to 2000
was principally due to the acquisition of a financial software products
company in January 2000 for $17.4 million. In addition, the Company
increased its spending on computer equipment and software development from
1999 to 2000. Capital expenditures, which principally include investments in
purchasing, developing and upgrading computer hardware, software and
systems, and improvements to owned and leased office facilities, were $14.8
million in 2001, $14.4 million in 2000 and $12.9 million in 1999. Currently,
the Company has commitments related to its planned acquisition of KMV for
$210 million and contingent payments of up to $5.4 million related to the
Company’s investment in Korea Investors Service. See Notes 5, Investments in
Affiliates, and 17, Subsequent Event, to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements for further detail.

Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($233.0) million,
$81.6 million and ($186.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 and 2000 amounts consisted primarily
of $267.6 million and $71.8 million, respectively, for repurchases of the
Company’s common stock under its share repurchase program. These amounts
were offset in part by stock option proceeds and related tax benefits of
$62.9 million and $12.7 million, respectively. In addition, the 2001 and
2000 amounts included dividends paid of $28.3 million and $7.2 million,
respectively. The 2000 amount also included $104.5 million of net proceeds
from the private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter and
distributions made to Old D&B through the Distribution Date. The 1999 amount
represents a net distribution to Old D&B.

Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Moody’s was allocated $195.5 million
of debt at September 30, 2000. Moody’s funded this debt with borrowings
under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank
bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million
of notes in a private placement (the “Notes”). The private placement notes
have a five-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable
semi-annually. The cash proceeds from the private placement were used in
part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and
to repay the bridge line of credit.

The revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), which was undrawn as of
December 31, 2001, consists of an $80 million 5-year facility and an $80
million 364-day facility. Interest rates on borrowings under the Facility
are based on prevailing short-term rates at the time of such borrowings. As
noted below, Moody’s intends to draw down on this Facility to initially fund
the planned acquisition of KMV.

The Notes and the Facility (the “Agreements”) contain covenants that, among
other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries,
without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations,
asset sales and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and
the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things,
require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in
the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and a ratio of total indebtedness
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as
defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2001 the
Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. If an event of default
were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the
Company within the stipulated time frame, an acceleration of the Notes and
restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur.



At December 31, 2001 and 2000, Moody’s did not have
any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships,
such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities, which would
have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such,
Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk
that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.

In February 2002, Moody’s reached a definitive agreement to acquire KMV, a
market-based, quantitative credit risk management tools company, in an all
cash transaction for $210 million. Moody’s expects the transaction to close
by the early part of the second quarter of 2002 and initially to be funded
by a combination of cash on hand and its existing $160 million Facility. The
Company plans to secure more permanent financing for all or part of the
purchase price, in order to retain open bank credit lines and to use its
cash flow from operations for share repurchases. The KMV acquisition is
subject to a number of closing conditions and there can be no guarantee that
the transaction will be consummated or that the Company will be able to
successfully integrate the KMV and Moody’s Risk Management Services
businesses.

Moody’s expects to have positive operating cash flow, as well as after-tax
free cash flow, for fiscal year 2002. The Company currently intends to use
the majority of such free cash flow to continue its share repurchase
program. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are
subject to substantial uncertainty. See “Additional Factors That May Affect
Future Results” in this section. In addition, the Company will from time to
time consider acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses,
products, services and technologies, which might affect liquidity
requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can
be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms
acceptable to the Company, if at all.

Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results

The following risk factors and other information
included in this Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described
below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company’s
management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business
operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody’s business, financial
condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely
affected.

Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global
Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the
Financial Markets

Approximately 90% of Moody’s revenue in 2001 was derived from ratings, a
significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive
securities issued in the global capital markets. Moody’s enjoyed revenue
growth from these sources in 2001 that was substantially greater than its
historical averages, principally due to strong issuance volumes driven by
the favorable interest rate environment in the U.S. and very strong growth
in global structured finance issuance. The Company anticipates that a
substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number
and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets.
Therefore, the Company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction
of the level of debt issuance.

Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor
demand for debt securities or impair issuers’ ability to issue such
securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance and
other transactions for which Moody’s provides ratings services. In addition,
increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest
rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of
significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively
impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of
certain categories of borrowers, and/or the types of credit-sensitive
products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness
could also have a material adverse affect on Moody’s business and financial
results.

Possible Loss of Market Share through Competition

The markets for credit ratings, research and risk management services are
intensely competitive. Moody’s competes on the basis of a number of factors,
including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price,
geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moody’s
faces increasing competition from Standard & Poor’s Credit Market Service,
Fitch, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche
companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or
issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moody’s
believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will
arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that
may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those
markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in
the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions.

Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies

The markets for credit rating, research and risk management services are
increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and
technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize
emerging technological trends is a key factor to maintaining market share.
Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk
that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more
cost-effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by
Moody’s.

Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers

In the credit rating, research and risk management markets, competition for
customers and market share has spurred more



aggressive
tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moody’s
intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service
to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services
are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors,
Moody’s may lose market share.

Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or
Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures

Moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly
skilled, experienced analysts and other professionals. Competition for
qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s
ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer
competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other
competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than
Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside
the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated
credit analysis. Moody’s ability to effectively compete will continue to
depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to
retain and motivate existing employees.

Exposure to Litigation Related to Moody’s Rating Opinions

Moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages
arising from allegedly inaccurate ratings. In addition, as Moody’s
international business expands, these types of claims may increase because
foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections comparable to those in
the U.S. (such as the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult
to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains
unknown for substantial periods of time.

Potential Emergence of Government-Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies

When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated,
establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to
provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and
the level of demand for ratings may be negatively affected.
Government-mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing
objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers
may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such
as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on
their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher
rating, which may negatively affect the Company.

Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations,
Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations

In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to
credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has
been discussion in the U.S. regarding study of the regulation of credit
rating agencies. Changes in the current U.S. regulatory regime could
increase Moody’s costs or change the environment in which Moody’s operates.
Failure to maintain governmental authorizations or to comply with local laws
and regulations could negatively impact the ability of Moody’s to compete in
the U.S. and other jurisdictions.

Multinational Operations

Moody’s maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion
of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different
countries expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks
such as:

Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on
the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company,
any of such factors could have such an effect in the future.

Share Repurchase Program

In October 2000, the Board of Directors of Moody’s Corporation authorized a
share repurchase program of up to $250 million, which amount was
subsequently increased to $300 million. The program includes both special
share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moody’s common stock to
offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the company’s employee
benefit arrangements. In October 2001, Moody’s Board of Directors authorized
special and systematic share repurchases of up to an additional $300
million.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company repurchased 2.1 million
shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $72 million. For
the full year 2001, Moody’s repurchased 8.5 million shares at a total cost
of $268 million, bringing total repurchases since program inception to 11.3
million shares at a cost of approximately $340 million. This includes 3.4
million shares, at a cost of approximately $103 million, to offset issuances
under Moody’s stock plans. Moody’s anticipates completing the current $300
million share repurchase program by mid-2003.

Contingencies

Moody’s is involved in legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to
its business. In the opinion of management, although the outcome of such
legal proceedings cannot be predicted



with certainty,
the ultimate liability of Moody’s in connection with such legal proceedings
will not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash
flows or financial position. In addition, Moody’s has certain other
contingencies discussed below.

Tax Matters

Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moody’s have agreed to
each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that
may arise with respect to the matters described below, to the extent such
potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective
business operations.

Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in
the normal course of business, including through tax-free restructurings of
both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to
normal review by tax authorities. It is possible that additional liabilities
may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that one
or more of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably. At this time, Moody’s
management is unable to predict the extent of such reviews, the outcome
thereof or whether the resolution of these matters could materially affect
Moody’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital
losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of
its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the
utilization of these capital losses and Old D&B responded by filing a
petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000,
after the payments described below were made.

On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax
periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old D&B
paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000, of
which 50% was on behalf of Moody’s. IMS Health has informed Old D&B that it
paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments
were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing. Notwithstanding
the filing and payment, New D&B is contesting the IRS’s formal assessment
and would also contest the assessment of amounts, if any, in excess of the
amounts paid. Moody’s had previously accrued its anticipated share of the
probable liability arising from the utilization of these capital losses.

Information Resources, Inc.

On July 29, 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”) filed a complaint in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
naming as defendants R.H. Donnelley Corporation (“Donnelley”), ACNielsen
Company, (a subsidiary of ACNielsen Corporation) and IMS International Inc.
(a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant Corporation). At the
time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a
subsidiary of Donnelley.

The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws,
including purported violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The
complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and
a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship.
These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research
Group Limited (“SRG”). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with
IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants
induced SRG to breach that agreement.

IRI’s complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount IRI
has asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI also seeks punitive
damages in an unspecified amount.

Under the terms of the 1998 Distribution Agreement, as a condition to the
Distribution, New D&B undertook to be jointly and severally liable with
Moody’s for Old D&B’s obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution
Agreement, including any liabilities relating to the IRI action. However,
under the Distribution Agreement, as between themselves, each of New D&B and
Moody’s has agreed to be responsible for 50% of any payments to be made in
respect of the IRI action pursuant to the 1998 Distribution Agreement or
otherwise, including any legal fees or expenses related thereto.

Management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the IRI
action or whether the resolution of such matter could materially affect
Moody’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. See Note 14
to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, Contingencies, for
additional information.

L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’Emprunts Russes

On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by L’Association
Francaise des Porteurs d’Emprunts Russes (“AFPER”) against Moody’s France SA
(a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of
Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by
the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims
against Moody’s France SA and Standard & Poor’s SA for lack of diligence and
prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER
alleges that, by failing to take into account the post-Revolutionary
repudiation of pre-Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in
rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating
agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying
the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several
liability, AFPER seeks damages of approximately $2.43 billion plus legal
costs. Moody’s believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and
intends to vigorously contest the action.

Dividends

During 2001 and in the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company paid a quarterly
dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moody’s common stock, resulting in
dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in



2001 and 4.5
cents in 2000. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2000, when Moody’s was a
subsidiary of Old D&B, the Company did not pay dividends directly to Old D&B
shareholders.

In December 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a first quarter
2002 dividend of 4.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2002 to
shareholders of record on February 28, 2002. The payment and level of cash
dividends by Moody’s going forward will be subject to the discretion of the
Moody’s Board of Directors.

Common Stock Information

As described above in “Item 1—Business—The
Distribution”, the Distribution was completed on September 30, 2000. As of October 3, 2000
the Company’s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol “MCO”. The table below indicates the high and low sales
price of the Company’s common stock and the dividends paid for the periods
shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2002
was 5,754.

Fees of Independent Accountants

During 2001, Moody’s incurred $3.7 million for services rendered by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”), its independent accountants. The aggregate
fees of PwC for professional services rendered for the audit of the
Company’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2001
and for the review of the financial statements included in the Company’s
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q during such year were approximately $0.6
million.

PwC did not render professional services to the Company relating to
financial information systems design and implementation, for the year ended
December 31, 2001.

The aggregate fees for services rendered by PwC to the Company, were
approximately $3.1 million (including $0.2 million incurred but not billed
in 2001). Approximately one-half of such fees were for consultation on
various tax matters of a non-recurring nature, in connection with the
Company’s transition to an independent company. The remainder principally
related to tax consulting and compliance, expatriate tax services,
acquisition reviews and statutory audits of non-U.S. subsidiaries.

It is the intention of the Company in 2002 to substantially reduce the
amount of non-audit services provided by PwC and thereafter to minimize the
amount of these services from PwC, compatible with their efficient use.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements contained in this Form 10-K are forward-looking
statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for
Moody’s business and operations that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001,
and management disclaims any duty to update or revise such statements on a
going-forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed
expectations or otherwise. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is
identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ,
perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward-looking
statements. Those factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the
volume of debt securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets;
changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets;
possible loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing
products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressures from
competitors and/or customers; the potential emergence of
government-sponsored credit rating agencies; proposed U.S., foreign, state
and local legislation and regulations, including those relating to
nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; the possible loss of
key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related
compensation cost pressures; and the outcome of any review by controlling
tax authorities of the Company’s global tax planning initiatives. These
factors and other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moody’s actual
results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are
described in greater detail in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Additional Factors That May
Affect Future Results” and in other reports of the Company filed from time
to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Moody’s Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Moody’s
Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation

Moody’s Corporation (“Moody’s” or the “Company”), a global credit rating,
research and risk analysis firm, publishes credit opinions, research and
ratings on fixed-income securities, issuers of securities and other credit
obligations. The Company publishes rating opinions on a broad range of
credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including
various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance
securities and commercial paper programs. The Company also publishes
investor-oriented credit research including in-depth research on major
issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks.
Moody’s Risk Management Services develops and distributes credit risk
assessment software used by banks and other financial institutions in their
commercial lending, portfolio management and other activities. It also
provides modeling tools, analytics, credit education materials, seminars,
computer-based lending simulations and other products and services.

The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”)
until September 30, 2000 (the “Distribution Date”), when Old D&B separated
into two publicly traded companies—Moody’s Corporation and The New D&B
Corporation (“New D&B”). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its
shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old
D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the “D&B Business”). The remaining
business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings
and related research and risk management services (the “Moody’s Business”)
and was renamed “Moody’s Corporation.” The method by which Old D&B
distributed its shares is hereinafter referred to as “the Distribution.”

For purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between the Company
and New D&B after the Distribution and to provide for an orderly transition,
the Company and New D&B entered into various agreements including a
Distribution Agreement, Tax Allocation Agreement, Employee Benefits
Agreement, Shared Transaction Services Agreement, Insurance and Risk
Management Services Agreement, Data Services Agreement and Transition
Services Agreement.

Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Company retained
all of the assets and liabilities related to the Moody’s Business and New
D&B retained all of the assets and liabilities related to the D&B Business.
Prior to the Distribution Date, Old D&B provided certain centralized
services to the Company, the cost of which was allocated to the Company.
Management believes these allocations were reasonable; however, the costs of
these services are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have
been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a
separate entity. These allocations, included in the consolidated statements
of operations, were $13.3 million in 2000 and $17.2 million in 1999. The
consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company as if it were a separate entity for
all periods presented.

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include those of Moody’s Corporation
and all its subsidiaries. The effects of all intercompany transactions have
been eliminated. The Company generally consolidates all majority-owned and
controlled subsidiaries. Investments in companies over which the Company has
significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on an
equity basis. Investments for which the Company does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are
carried at cost. See Note 5 for a description of the Company’s investments
in affiliates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents principally consist of money market funds, short-term
certificates of deposit and commercial paper with maturity periods of three
months or less when purchased. Approximately $152 million and $88 million,
respectively, were cash equivalents at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Interest
income on cash and cash equivalents was $6.5 million and $2.2 million,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, typically three to
ten years for computer equipment and office furniture and fixtures and seven
to forty years for buildings and building improvements. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs that do not extend the economic useful life of the
related assets are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on
disposals of property and equipment are reflected in the consolidated
statements of operations. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the
improvement.

Computer Software

Costs for the development of computer software that will be sold, leased or
otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been
established. These assets, included in other assets in the consolidated
balance sheets, primarily relate to the development of credit risk
assessment software to be licensed to customers. The capitalized costs
generally consist of professional services provided by third parties and
compensation costs of employees that develop the software. These costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which approximates
their useful life, and are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net
realizable value. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the amounts included in
other assets were $6.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively, net of
accumulated amortization of $5.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively.

The Company capitalizes costs related to software developed or obtained for
internal use in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.”
These assets, included in property and equipment in the consolidated balance
sheets, relate to the Company’s accounting, product delivery and other
systems. Such



costs
generally consist of direct costs of third party license fees, professional
services provided by third parties and employee compensation, in each case
incurred either during the application stage or in connection with upgrades
and enhancements that increase functionality. Such costs are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives, generally three to five years. Costs
incurred during the preliminary project stage of development as well as
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. If the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the carrying amount
of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying
amount and the estimated fair value of the asset.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill of $6.0 million and $8.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, net of accumulated amortization of $5.3 million and $3.2
million, respectively, represents the excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired businesses and is
amortized on a straight-line basis over five to ten years. Other intangible
assets of $4.3 million and $5.2 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, net of accumulated amortization of $1.8 million and $0.9
million, arose through acquisitions of businesses and are being amortized
over their estimated useful lives, generally five to seven years.

At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the recoverability of
goodwill and intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash
flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value, and
recognizes any impairment on the basis of such comparison. For the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, no goodwill impairments were recognized.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company will adopt Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” for purchase business combinations. Among other things, the
goodwill described above will no longer be amortized. See a further
description of this statement under the “Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements” section of this Note 2.

Employee Benefit Plans

Pension benefits and postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits
earned by employees during the year as well as interest on projected benefit
obligations are accrued currently. Prior service costs and credits resulting
from changes in plan benefits are amortized over the average remaining
service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” As such, revenue is
recognized when an agreement exists, the services have been provided and
accepted by the customer, fees are determinable and the collection of
resulting receivables is considered probable.

Revenue attributed to ratings of issued securities is generally recognized
when the rating is issued. Revenue attributed to monitoring activities is
recognized over the period in which the related monitoring is performed,
which is generally one year and can be up to 30 years in certain cases,
particularly related to commercial mortgage-backed securities.Revenue
related to annual fees for areas such as frequent issuer program
arrangements and commercial paper programs is generally recognized over the
contract term, which is principally one year. In recognizing revenue
related to ratings, Moody’s uses judgments to match billed revenue with
services to be provided in the future. These judgments are generally not
dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to
allocating revenue across accounting periods.

Revenue from sales of research products and from risk management services
subscription products is recognized over the related subscription period,
which is principally one year. Revenue from sales of risk management
services software is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped
to customers, as the Company’s obligations are complete. Related maintenance
revenue is recognized over the maintenance period, which is generally one
year.

Amounts billed in advance of providing the related products or services are
credited to deferred revenue and reflected in revenue when earned. The
consolidated balance sheets reflect as current deferred revenue amounts that
are expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date, and
as non-current deferred revenue amounts that are expected to be recognized
over periods greater than one year. Non-current deferred revenue principally
reflects monitoring fees for commercial mortgage-backed securities that are
billed when the related rating is issued.

Accounts Receivable Allowances

Moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future
adjustments to customer billings, based on historical experience and current
conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts
receivable allowance; adjustments to and write-offs of receivables are
charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its estimates on a regular
basis and makes adjustments to its provisions and the accounts receivable
allowance as considered appropriate.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling, general and administrative expense is charged to income as
incurred. This expense includes such items as compensation for officers and
corporate staff and compensation and other expenses related to sales of
products. It also includes items such as office rent, business insurance,
professional fees and gains and losses from sales and disposals of assets.
2001 selling, general and administrative expense included unusual costs of
approximately $5.0 million for severance, legal fees and other costs related
to the Company’s legal settlement with the Department of Justice in April
2001 and $6.0 million related to charitable contributions and initial
funding for the newly formed Moody’s Foundation.

Foreign Currency Translation

For all operations outside the United States where the Company has
designated the local currency as the functional currency, assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of year exchange
rates, and revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates
for the year. For these operations, currency translation



adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of
shareholders’ equity. Realized transaction gains and losses are reflected in
other non-operating expense, net. Transaction losses were $0.1 million, $0.9
million and $0.7 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income represents the change in net assets of a business
enterprise during a period due to transactions and other events and
circumstances from non-owner sources including foreign currency translation
impacts. The required disclosures have been included in the consolidated
statements of shareholders’ equity. The net effect of income taxes on
comprehensive income was not significant for any period presented.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Therefore,
income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and
deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between
the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax
purposes.

Prior to the Distribution, the Company was included in the federal and
certain state income tax returns of Old D&B; however, the provision for
income taxes for each of the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 has been
calculated on a separate-company basis. Moody’s share of income taxes paid
by Old D&B through the Distribution Date have been reflected in the
consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity as net distributions to Old
D&B.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents and trade
receivables and payables, all of which are short-term in nature and,
accordingly, approximate fair value. The fair value of the Company’s
long-term notes payable is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses
based on the prevailing interests rates available to the Company. The
carrying amount and fair value of the notes payable at December 31, 2001
were $300.0 million and $324.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2000,
the fair value of the Company’s notes payable approximated the carrying
value of $300 million. See Note 10, Indebtedness.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade
receivables.

Cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade
securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company
limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer. The Company manages its
credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money
market mutual funds, short-term certificates of deposit or issuers of
high-grade commercial paper. As of December 31, 2001, the Company did not
maintain any derivative investments or engage in any hedging activities.

Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial
condition. No customer accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable at
December 31, 2001 or 2000.

Earnings Per Share of Common Stock

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share,” basic earnings per
share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is
calculated giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, assuming
that such shares were outstanding during the reporting period.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are
used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition, accounts receivable
allowances, income taxes, contingencies, valuation of investments in
affiliates, long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill, stock options,
and depreciation and amortization rates for property and equipment,
goodwill, other intangible assets and computer software.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

On July 20, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
141, “Business Combinations,” and
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and
other intangible assets acquired in a business combination at acquisition.
It requires the purchase method of accounting to be used for all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, establishes specific criteria
for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill and
requires unallocated negative goodwill to be written off immediately as an
extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized. SFAS No. 141 is
effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and
for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which
the date of acquisition is after June 30, 2001.

SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for intangible
assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets (but not those
acquired in a business combination) at acquisition. SFAS No. 142 also
addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other
intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS No. 142 provides
that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will
not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment.
It also provides that intangible assets that have finite useful lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives, but those lives will no
longer be limited to forty years. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.

The Company will adopt SFAS No. 142 beginning January 1, 2002. The Company
has considered the provisions of SFAS Nos. 141 and No. 142 and does not
expect that adoption of these pronouncements will have a material impact on
its financial statements.



Note 3 Reconciliation of Weighted Average Shares Outstanding

Below is a reconciliation of basic weighted average shares outstanding to
diluted weighted average shares outstanding:

Options to purchase 0.1 million, 8.0 million and 3.0 million shares of
common stock were outstanding at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings
per share because the options’ exercise prices were greater than the average
market price of the Company’s common stock during the applicable period.

Note 4 Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net consisted of:

The consolidated statements of operations reflect depreciation and
amortization expense related to the above assets of $11.7 million, $11.6
million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

Note 5 Investments in Affiliates

The company maintains investments in non-U.S. credit rating agencies in
Argentina, Korea, India and Chile. It accounts for these investments using
the cost or equity method, depending on the level of influence the Company
is able to exert over the operations of the investee. A summary of the
significant investments follows.

Argentina

From 1999 through 2001, the Company made equity investments totaling $4.4
million in two Argentine rating agencies. In January 2002, the Argentine
government announced the creation of a dual currency system in which certain
transactions would be settled at an expected fixed exchange rate of 1.4
Argentine pesos to one U.S. dollar, while non-qualifying transactions would
be settled using a free floating market exchange rate. In February 2002, the
Argentine government announced a shift to a single free floating market
exchange rate. From 1991 until the date of the announcement, the Argentine
peso had been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of one to one.

Given the significant adverse change in the economic climate in Argentina,
the Company determined that the Argentine ratings businesses, their future
cash flows and operations were materially impacted and that this was not a
temporary change. Therefore, the recoverability of these investments was
reviewed based on a comparison of carrying value to fair value, which was
calculated using estimated future discounted cash flows of the businesses.
Based on that review, it was determined that the fair values of these
investments were $3.4 million less than the aggregate carrying value; this
amount was charged to expense in the fourth quarter of 2001.

Korea

In August 1998, the Company made a 10% cost-basis investment in Korea
Investors Service (“KIS”), a Korean rating agency. In December 2001, the
Company entered into a definitive agreement to increase its investment to
just over 50%, at a cost of $9.6 million with contingent payments of up to
$5.4 million based on future earnings of KIS. The purchase price of $9.6
million was held in escrow pending regulatory approval in Korea, which was
received in January 2002.

The investment was recorded at cost through December 31, 2001; starting in
January 2002, the Company will consolidate the results of KIS in its
financial statements.

India

In August 1998, the Company made an 11% cost-basis investment in ICRA
Limited, an Indian rating agency. In September 2001, the Company increased
its investment to 21%, at a cost of $1.3 million, and started accounting for
its investment under the equity method.

Note 6 Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities consisted of the following:

Note 7 Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits

Moody’s maintains defined benefit pension plans in which substantially all
U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate. The Company also
provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired U.S.
employees.

Prior to the Distribution, the Company’s employees participated in Old D&B’s
pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The Company accounted for its
participation in these Old D&B plans as multi-employer plans. Accordingly,
through the Distribution Date, the Company recorded pension and
post-retirement benefit costs as allocated by Old D&B. The amounts of these
allocations were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2000 and
1999. Effective at the Distribution Date, Moody’s assumed responsibility for
pension and post-retirement benefits relating to its active employees. New
D&B has assumed responsibility for the Company’s retirees and vested
terminated employees as of the Distribution Date.



Following is a summary of the activity related to these
benefit plans for the period from the Distribution Date through December 31,
2000 and for the year ended December 31, 2001, as well as the status of the
plans at December 31, 2001:

The following assumptions were used in determining the benefit obligation
and net periodic pension (income) expense for the period from the
Distribution Date through December 31, 2000 and for the year ended December
31, 2001:

For post-retirement benefit plan measurement purposes, a 9.0% annual rate of

for 2002. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% through 2009
and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed healthcare cost trend rates
have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans.

Profit Participation Plan

Moody’s has a profit participation plan (the “Plan”) covering substantially
all U.S. employees. The Plan provides for an employee salary deferral
contribution and Company contributions. Employees may contribute up to 16%
of their pay, subject to the federal limit. Moody’s contributes an amount
equal to 50% of employee contributions, with Moody’s contribution limited to
3% of the employee’s pay. Moody’s also makes additional contributions to the
Plan that are based on growth in the Company’s earnings per share. Prior to
the Distribution, employees of Moody’s participated in the profit
participation plan of Old D&B and the Company accounted for its
participation in that plan as a multi-employer plan. Expense associated with
these plans was $11.1 million, $3.5 million and $2.8 million in 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively.

Note 8 Stock-Based Compensation Plans

Prior to the Distribution, certain employees of Moody’s received grants of
Old D&B stock options under Old D&B’s 1998 Key Employees’ Stock Option Plan
(the “1998 Plan”). At the Distribution Date, all unexercised Old D&B stock
options held by Moody’s employees were converted into separately exercisable
options to acquire Moody’s common stock and separately exercisable options
to acquire New D&B common stock, such that each option had the same ratio of
the exercise price per option to the market value per share, the same
aggregate difference between market value and exercise price, and the same
vesting provisions, option periods and other terms and conditions applicable
prior to the Distribution. Old D&B stock options held by employees and
retirees of Old D&B were converted in the same manner. Immediately after the
Distribution, the 1998 Plan was amended and adopted by the Company.

Under the 1998 Plan, 16,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were
reserved for issuance. The 1998 Plan provides that options are exercisable
not later than ten years from the grant date. The vesting period for awards
under the 1998 Plan is determined by the Board of Directors at the date of
the grant and generally ranges from one to five years. Options may not be
granted at less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at
the date of grant. For incentive stock options granted to a shareholder of
more than 10% of the Company’s outstanding stock, the



exercise price per share cannot be less than
110% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of
grant.

The 2001 Moody’s Corporation Key Employees’ Stock Incentive Plan (the “2001
Plan”) was approved by the Board of Directors in February 2001 and approved
by shareholders in April 2001. Under the 2001 plan, 5,800,000 shares of
common stock have been reserved for issuance. Options may not be granted at
less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of
grant. The 2001 Plan provides that options are exercisable not later than
ten years from the grant date. The vesting period for awards under the 2001
Plan is determined by the Board of directors at the date of the grant.
Unlike the 1998 Plan, the 2001 Plan also provides that consultants to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries are eligible to be granted options. There
were no options outstanding under the 2001 Plan at December 31, 2001.

Under the 1998 and 2001 Plans, key employees of the Company may be granted shares
of common stock (“Performance Shares”) based on the achievement of
revenue growth goals or other operating objectives. At the end of the
performance period, Company performance at target will yield the targeted
amount of shares, whereas Company performance above or below target will
yield larger or smaller share awards, respectively. As a result of the
Distribution, Performance Share grants relating to the Company’s revenue
performance for 1999 and 2000 were converted such that the employees would
receive a combination of Moody’s shares and cash in lieu of New D&B shares.
In 2001, approximately 100,000 shares of Moody’s common stock were awarded
based on the Company’s revenue performance for 1999 and 2000. Cash payments
aggregating $2.5 million were made in lieu of New D&B shares. There were no
new Performance Share grants in 2001. The Company recorded compensation
expense relating to performance share grants of $4.6 million in 2000 and
$11.5 million in 1999. No such expense was recorded in 2001.

The Company also maintains a plan for its Board of Directors, the 1998
Directors Plan (the “Directors Plan”), which permits the granting of awards
in the form of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock or performance shares.
Under the Directors Plan, 400,000 shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance. Any director of the Company who is not an employee of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the date that an award is
granted is eligible to participate in the Directors Plan.

In February 2002, employees and directors of the Company were granted 3.5
million options under the 1998 Plan and the Directors Plan. Option grants
under the above plans in 2001 were not material.

SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” requires that
companies with stock-based compensation plans either recognize compensation
expense based on the fair value of options granted or continue to apply
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB No. 25”) and related
interpretations and disclose pro forma net income and earnings per share
assuming that the fair value method had been applied. Moody’s has elected to
continue applying APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
its plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for the
Company’s fixed stock option plans.

Had compensation expense for Moody’s
stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant
dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method required by
SFAS No. 123, Moody’s net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts shown below:

The pro forma disclosures shown above are not representative of the effects
on net income and earnings per share in future years.

The pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts for periods prior to
the Distribution Date relate to the fair value of the Old D&B options held
by Moody’s employees. Pro forma amounts subsequent to the Distribution Date
relate to Moody’s options held by Moody’s employees and New D&B employees
and retirees and reflect an increase in fair value due to changes in
assumptions for Moody’s stock options. Post-distribution, such increase is
reflected in income immediately for vested options and spread over the
remaining vesting period for converted unvested options. 2001 and 2000 pro
forma net income includes charges of $2.5 million and $2.4 million,
respectively, relating to New D&B employees and retirees.

The weighted average fair value of Moody’s options granted in 2001 was
$9.38. The weighted average fair value of Moody’s options granted after the
Distribution Date in 2000 was $8.20. The weighted average fair value of Old
D&B options granted prior to the Distribution Date was $8.66 in 2000 and
$8.78 in 1999.

The fair value of stock options used to compute the pro forma net income and
earnings per share disclosures is the estimated present value at grant date
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted
average assumptions:

In 2000 prior to the distribution and in 1999, the following weighted

periods, expected stock volatility of 30% in both periods, risk-free
interest rate of 6.69% and 6.41%, respectively, and expected holding period
of five years in both periods.



Changes in stock options for the three years ended
December 31, 2001 are summarized below:

Option activity for the period from December 31, 1998 through September 30,
2000 reflects Old D&B options that were held by employees of Moody’s. The
options converted at October 1, 2000 reflect the conversion of all Old D&B
options, including both those held by employees of Moody’s and those held by
employees and retirees of New D&B, into separately exercisable options to
acquire common stock of Moody’s as described above.

The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2001:

Note 9 Income Taxes

Components of the Company’s income tax provision are as follows:

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Company’s
effective tax rate on income before provision for income taxes is as
follows:

Income taxes paid were $98.6 million, $206.0 million and $116.0 million in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:



The current deferred tax assets, as well as prepaid taxes of $26.4 million
and $28.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, are included
in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Non-current
deferred tax liabilities, net of non-current deferred tax assets, are
included in other liabilities. Management has determined, based on the
Company’s history of prior and current levels of operating earnings, that no
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets should be provided as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000.

At December 31, 2001, undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries
aggregated $26.1 million. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized
for these undistributed earnings because it is management’s intention to
reinvest such undistributed earnings outside the U.S. If all undistributed
earnings were remitted to the U.S., the amount of incremental U.S. federal
and foreign income taxes payable, net of foreign tax credits, would be $1.0
million.

Note 10 Indebtedness

Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Moody’s was allocated $195.5 million
of debt at September 30, 2000. Moody’s funded this debt with borrowings
under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank
bridge line of credit.

On October 3, 2000 the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the
“Notes”) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used
in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility
and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five-year term and
bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi-annually. Interest
paid under the Notes was $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001;
no interest was paid in 2000.

The revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), which was undrawn as of
December 31, 2001, consists of an $80 million 5-year facility, which expires
in September 2005 and an $80 million 364-day facility, which expires in
September 2002. Interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly at
rates of interest that are based on prevailing short-term interest rates at
the time of such borrowings. No interest was paid under the Facility for the
year ended December 31, 2001. Interest paid under the Facility for the year
ended December 31, 2000 was $0.1 million.

The Notes and the Facility contain covenants that, among other things,
restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the
approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales
and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, and require the Company
to maintain certain financial ratios. The Notes and the Facility also
contain financial covenants which, among other things require the Company to
maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not
less than 3 to 1, and a ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in the
Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1.

Note 11 Acquisition and Divestiture

On January 27, 2000, the Company acquired the net assets of a financial
software products company for $17.4 million in cash. The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business
combinations from the date of acquisition. The purchase price was allocated
based on estimated fair values of the acquired assets at the date of
acquisition, which resulted in acquired goodwill, other intangibles
including customer relationships and covenants not to compete, and
capitalized software aggregating $16.6 million. These amounts are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over three to seven years.

In July 1998, Moody’s sold its Financial Information Services business
(“FIS”), which was engaged in the publishing of historical financial
information. Moody’s received $26.5 million at the sale date and recorded a
pre-tax gain of $12.6 million. During the third quarter of 1999, certain
agreements related to the sale of FIS expired or were completed. As a
result, estimated liabilities established at the time of the divestiture in
connection with these agreements, determined to be no longer required, were
adjusted, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $9.2 million.

Note 12 Capital Stock

Authorized Capital Stock

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Company has
authority to issue under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation is
420,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.01, of which 400,000,000 shares
represent shares of common stock, 10,000,000 shares represent shares of
preferred stock and 10,000,000 shares represent shares of series common
stock. The preferred stock and series common stock can be issued with
varying terms, as determined by the Board of Directors.

Rights Agreement

The Company has a Rights Agreement designed to protect its shareholders in
the event of unsolicited offers to acquire the Company and coercive takeover
tactics that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, could impair its
ability to represent shareholder interests. Under the Rights Agreement, each
share of common stock has a right that trades with the stock until the right
becomes exercisable. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase
1/1000 of a share of a series A junior participating preferred stock, par
value $0.01 per share, at a price of $100 per 1/1000 of a share, subject to
adjustment. The rights will generally not be exercisable until a person or
group (“Acquiring Person”) acquires beneficial ownership of, or commences a
tender offer or exchange offer that would result in such person or group
having beneficial ownership of, 15% or more of the outstanding common stock
at such time.

In the event that any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each
right will thereafter entitle its holder (other than the Acquiring Person)
to receive, upon exercise and payment, shares of stock having a market value
equal to two times the exercise



price in the form of the Company’s common stock or, where
appropriate, the Acquiring Person’s common stock. The rights are not currently
exercisable, as no shareholder is currently an Acquiring Person. The Company
may redeem the rights, which expire in June 2008, for $0.01 per right, under
certain circumstances, including for a Board approved acquirer either before
the acquirer becomes an Acquiring Person or during the window period after the
triggering event.

Share Repurchase Program

In October 2000, the Board of Directors of Moody’s Corporation authorized a
share repurchase program of up to $250 million; this amount was subsequently
increased to $300 million. The program includes both special share
repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moody’s common stock to offset the
dilutive effect of share issuance under the Company’s employee benefit
arrangements. In October 2001, Moody’s Board of Directors authorized share
repurchases of up to an additional $300 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, Moody’s repurchased 8.5 million shares
of its common stock at a total cost of $268 million, bringing total
repurchases since program inception to 11.3 million shares at a cost of
approximately $340 million. This includes 3.4 million shares, at a cost of
approximately $103 million, to offset issuances under Moody’s stock plans.
Moody’s anticipates completing the current $300 million share repurchase
program by mid-2003.

Dividends

During 2001 and in the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company paid a quarterly
dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moody’s common stock. In December 2001,
the Company’s Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2002 dividend of
4.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2002 to shareholders of record on
February 28, 2002.

Note 13 Lease Commitments

Moody’s operates its business from various leased facilities, which are
under operating leases that expire over the next eleven years. Moody’s also
leases certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that
expire over the next six years. Rent expense under operating leases for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $8.0 million, $7.1 million
and $5.6 million, respectively. Rent expense for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was net
of sublease rental income of $1.0 million in each year related to a facility
utilized by FIS, which was sold in July 1998.

The approximate minimum rent for operating leases that have remaining
noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2001, net of
sublease rental commitments, are as follows:

Note 14 Contingencies

Moody’s is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in
the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of such matters cannot
be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, the ultimate
liability of Moody’s in connection with such matters will not have a
material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

In addition, Moody’s has certain other contingencies
discussed below.

Information Resources, Inc.

On July 29, 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”) filed a complaint in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun & Bradstreet
Corporation and, as discussed below, now known as R.H. Donnelley Corporation
(“Donnelley”), A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen Corporation)
and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as
Cognizant Corporation). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of
the other defendants was a subsidiary of Donnelley.

The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws,
including purported violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The
complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and
a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship.
These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research
Group Limited (“SRG”). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with
IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants
induced SRG to breach that agreement.

IRI’s complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount IRI
asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI also seeks punitive damages of
an unspecified amount.

In November 1996, Donnelley completed a distribution to its shareholders
(the “1996 Distribution”) of the capital stock of ACNielsen Corporation
(“ACNielsen”) and Cognizant Corporation (“Cognizant”). On October 28, 1996,
in connection with the 1996 Distribution, Cognizant, ACNielsen and Donnelley
entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the “Indemnity and
Joint Defense Agreement”) pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to certain
arrangements allocating potential liabilities (“IRI Liabilities”) that may
arise out of or in connection with the IRI action and (ii) to conduct a
joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense
Agreement provides that ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI
Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time such
liabilities, if any, become payable (the “ACN Maximum Amount”), and that
Donnelley and Cognizant will share liability equally for any amounts in
excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined
by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able
to pay after giving effect to (i) any plan submitted by such investment bank
that is designed to maximize the claims-paying ability of ACNielsen without
impairing the investment banking firm’s ability to deliver a viability
opinion (but which will not require any action requiring shareholder
approval), and (ii) payment of related fees and expenses. For these
purposes, financial viability means



the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such
plan, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN
Maximum Amount, to pay its debts as they become due and to finance the
current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business,
as reconstituted by such plan, for two years from the date any such plan is
expected to be implemented. On February 19, 2001, ACNielsen announced that
it had merged with VNU N.V. Pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense
Agreement, VNU is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining
the ACN Maximum Amount, and VNU must assume ACNielsen’s liabilities under
that agreement.

In June 1998, Donnelley completed a distribution to its shareholders (the
“1998 Distribution”) of the capital stock of Old D&B and changed its name to
R.H. Donnelley Corporation. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old
D&B and Donnelley entered into an agreement (the “1998 Distribution
Agreement”) whereby Old D&B has assumed all potential liabilities of
Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in
connection with such potential liabilities.

During 1998, Cognizant separated into two companies, IMS Health Incorporated
(“IMS Health”) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (“NMR”). IMS Health and NMR
are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under
the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement.

Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, as a condition to the
Distribution, New D&B undertook to be jointly and severally liable with
Moody’s for Old D&B’s obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution
Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint
Defense Agreement. However, as between themselves, each of New D&B and
Moody’s will be responsible for 50% of any payments to be made with respect
to the IRI action pursuant to the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including
legal fees or expenses related thereto.

Management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the IRI
action or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect
Moody’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. As such, no
amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial
statements of the Company.

L’Association Francaise des Porteurs
d’ Emprunts Russes

On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by L’Association
Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes (“AFPER”) against Moody’s France
SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of
Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by
the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims
against Moody’s France SA and Standard & Poor’s SA for lack of diligence and
prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER
alleges that, by failing to take into account the post-Revolutionary
repudiation of pre-Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government
in rating Russia and new
issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the
Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of
the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks
damages of approximately $2.43 billion plus legal costs. Moody’s believes
the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously
contest the action.

Tax Matters

Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moody’s have agreed to
each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that
may arise with respect to the reviews described below, to the extent such
potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective
business operations.

Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in
the normal course of business, including through tax-free restructurings of
both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to
normal review by tax authorities. It is possible that additional liabilities
may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that
some of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably. At this time, Moody’s
management is unable to predict the extent of such reviews, the outcome
thereof or whether the resolution of these matters could materially affect
Moody’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital
losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of
its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the
utilization of these capital losses and Old D&B responded by filing a
petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000,
after the payments described below were made.

Pursuant to a series of agreements, IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research
are jointly and severally liable to pay one-half, and R.H. Donnelley
Corporation (“Donnelley”) the other half, of any payments for taxes and
accrued interest arising from this matter and certain other potential tax
liabilities after Donnelley pays the first $137 million.

In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old D&B and Donnelley entered into
an agreement whereby Old D&B assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley
arising from these tax matters and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in
connection with such potential liabilities.

On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax
periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old D&B
paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000, of
which 50% was on behalf of Moody’s. IMS Health informed Old D&B that it paid
to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were
made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing. Notwithstanding the
filing and payment, New D&B is contesting the IRS’s formal assessment and
would also contest the assessment of amounts, if any, in excess of the
amounts paid. Moody’s had previously accrued its anticipated share of the
probable liability arising from the utilization of these capital losses.

Note 15 Segment Information

The Company reports segment information in accordance with SFAS No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” In
accordance with SFAS No. 131, operating segments are defined as components
of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that
is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how
to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company



operates primarily in one reportable business segment:
ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Company’s total revenue
in 2001. Given the dominance of the ratings segment to Moody’s overall results,
the Company does not separately measure and report operating income for the
ratings business. Rather, revenue is the predominant measure utilized by senior
management for assessing performance and for the allocation of resources, and
operating income is evaluated for the Company as a whole. In addition, assets
are not allocated on a segment basis and are considered only on a total company
basis.

The ratings segment comprises four major rating groups, each of which has
similar economic and financial characteristics. They are corporate finance,
structured finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk and public
finance.

Revenue included in “Other” consists of research revenue, generated from the
sale of investor-oriented credit research, and risk management services
revenue, generated from the sale of credit risk assessment software and
related products and services.

The accounting principles underlying the revenue information reported for
each segment are consistent with those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies in Note 2. There are no intersegment sales
and no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue.

Revenue and long-lived asset information by geographic area for the year ended and as of December 31 is summarized below:

International revenue is determined based on the customer’s country of
domicile.

Note 16 Valuation and Qualifying Accounts

Accounts receivable allowances primarily represent adjustments to customer
billings that are estimated when the related revenue is recognized. Below is

Note 17 Subsequent Event (Unaudited)

In February 2002, Moody’s reached a definitive agreement to acquire KMV, a
market-based, quantitative credit risk management tools company, in an all
cash transaction for $210 million. The acquisition will expand the customer
base and product offerings of Moody’s credit risk assessment business, which
is currently operated by Moody’s Risk Management Services. Moody’s expects
the transaction to close by the early part of the second quarter of 2002 and
initially to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and its existing
$160 million bank credit facility. The Company intends to pursue more
permanent financing for all or part of the purchase price, in order to
retain open bank credit lines and to use cash flow from operations for share
repurchases.

Note 18 Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each of
the periods presented. The number of weighted average shares outstanding
changes as common shares are issued for employee benefit arrangements and
other purposes or as shares are repurchased. Accordingly, the sum of the
quarterly earnings per share data may not agree to the total for the
year.
