PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

BACKGROUND

As used in this report, except where the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Moody’s” or the “Company” refer to Moody’s Corporation, a
Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. The Company’s executive offices are located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10007 and its telephone number is (212) 553-0300.

THE COMPANY

Moody’s is a provider of
(i) credit ratings, (ii) credit, capital markets and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) software solutions and related risk management services, (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, financial services
training and certification services and (v) outsourced research and analytical services to institutional customers. Moody’s reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA. The MIS segment consists of all credit rating activity. All of
Moody’s other non-rating commercial activities are included within the MA segment. Financial information and operating results of these segments, including revenue, expenses and operating income, are included in Part II, Item 8. Financial
Statements of this annual report, and are herein incorporated by reference.

MIS publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that
issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. Revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS
ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors. MIS provides ratings in more than 120 countries. Ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media, including the Internet
and real-time information systems widely used by securities traders and investors. As of December 31, 2013, MIS had ratings relationships with approximately 11,000 corporate issuers and approximately 21,000 public finance issuers. Additionally,
the Company has rated and currently monitors ratings on approximately 76,000 structured finance obligations (representing approximately 12,000 transactions). The aforementioned amounts relating to the number of issuers and transactions represent
issuers or transactions that had an active rating at any point during the year ended December 31, 2013.

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and
services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its Research, Data and Analytics business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its
ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, commentary on topical credit related events and also provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores.
Within its Enterprise Risk Solutions business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. Within its Professional Services business it provides outsourced research and analytical services along with financial
training and certification programs. MA customers represent more than 3,900 institutions worldwide operating in approximately 120 countries. During 2013 Moody’s research web site was accessed by over 230,000 individuals including 31,000 client
users.

The Company operated as part of “Old D&B” until September 30, 2000, when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies –
Moody’s Corporation and New D&B. At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company. The remaining
business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services and was renamed Moody’s Corporation. For purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between the
Company and New D&B after the 2000 Distribution and to provide for an orderly transition, the Company and New D&B entered into various agreements including a distribution agreement, tax allocation agreement and employee benefits agreement.

PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH

Over recent decades, global
fixed-income markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and the types of securities or other obligations outstanding. Beginning in mid-2007, there was a severe market disruption and associated financial crisis both in the


MOODY’S

2013 10K


developed and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak economic performance in advanced economies. Since this financial
crisis, many markets and economies have recovered and Moody’s believes that the overall long-term outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixed-income market and related financial information market, which includes
information such as credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services.

Moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends
that impact financial information markets including:

»

Health of the world’s major economies;

»

Debt capital markets activity;

»

Disintermediation of credit markets;

»

Fiscal and monetary policy of governments;

»

Changing regulatory requirements; and

»

Business investment spending.

Moody’s is well positioned to benefit from a continued recovery in global fixed-income
market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings as well as research and related analytical products in an environment with heightened attention to credit risk analysis and management. Moody’s expects that these developments will
support continued long-term demand for high-quality, independent credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services.

Strong
secular trends will continue to provide long-term growth opportunities. Moody’s key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global GDP growth, continued disintermediation of fixed-income markets in both developed and emerging
economies that drives issuance and demand for new products and services, growth in MA driven by further penetration of MA’s client base and expansion of bank and insurance risk regulatory requirements, pricing opportunities aligned with value
and advances in information technology.

Growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including
interest rates, business investment spending, corporate refinancing needs, merger and acquisition activity, issuer profits, consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity. Rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of
MIS. Therefore, a substantial portion of MIS’s revenue is dependent upon the dollar-equivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets. MIS’s results can be affected by factors such as the
performance and the prospects for growth of the major world economies, the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request MIS ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions. However, annual
fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers, annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and medium-term note programs, bank and insurance company financial strength ratings, mutual fund ratings, and other areas partially
mitigate MIS’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixed-income markets. Furthermore, the strong growth trend seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid-1990’s reversed
dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil, with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010, before stabilizing in 2011 with Moody’s experiencing revenue growth in this market in 2012. In 2013, Moody’s experienced revenue growth in the U.S.
structured credit and commercial real estate subsectors of the structured finance market, but also experienced a decline in non-U.S. structured finance revenue, most notably in EMEA. Despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels,
Moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixed-income markets and will provide opportunities for longer term revenue growth. Moody’s will continue to monitor this market and adapt to meet
the changing needs of its participants.

The pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives
widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets. Technology also
allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell, which in the absence of the appropriate technology may not be readily or
easily obtainable. This availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of established and newer capital markets. As technology provides
broader access to worldwide markets, it also results in a greater need for credible, globally comparable opinions about credit risk, data, analytics and related services. Additionally, information technology also provides opportunities to further
build a global platform to support Moody’s continued expansion in developing markets.

An ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the
disintermediation of financial systems. Issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets, in addition to, or in substitution for, traditional financial intermediaries. Moreover, financial intermediaries have sold assets in the
global public capital markets, in addition to, or instead of, retaining those assets. Credit market disruptions, which began in mid-2007, temporarily slowed the trend of disintermediation globally. Moody’s believes that debt capital markets
offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue. In fact, disintermediation continued in the past year because of the ongoing low interest rate
environment and ongoing

MOODY’S

2013 10K



bank deleveraging, which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets. Moody’s also observes disintermediation in key emerging
markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking system capacity. Thus, disintermediation is expected to continue over the longer-term, with Moody’s continuing to target investment and resources to those markets where
disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust.

In response to the credit market disruptions beginning in mid-2007 and, ongoing volatility in the
global capital markets, and new regulatory requirements, financial institutions are investing in people, processes and systems to enhance risk management and compliance functions. Regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, Basel II, Basel III, Solvency II and others may stimulate demand for MA products. Financial institutions are also investing in advanced qualitative and quantitative tools and services to support their management of complex
balance sheets and diverse portfolios. MA offers a suite of risk management products and services to address these needs, including but not limited to risk management software, economic analysis, training and professional services.

Legislative bodies and regulators in the U.S., Europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of CRAs, which may result in, for example,
an increased number of competitors, changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of MIS, removal of references to ratings in certain regulations, or increased costs of doing business for MIS. Therefore, in order to
broaden the potential for expansion of non-ratings services, Moody’s reorganized in January 2008 into two distinct businesses: MIS, consisting solely of the ratings business, and MA, which conducts all non-ratings activities including the sale
of credit research produced by MIS and the production and sale of other economic and credit-related products and services. The reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by MA into activities that may have otherwise been restricted for
MIS, due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business. At present, Moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities.

Moody’s operations are subject to various risks, as more fully described in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” inherent in conducting business on a
global basis. Such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization, expropriation, exchange and price controls, changes in the availability of data from public sector sources, limits on providing information across borders and other
restrictive governmental actions.

COMPETITION

The MIS business competes with other CRAs and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research. Many users of MIS’s ratings also
have in-house credit research capabilities. MIS’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P), a division of McGraw Hill Financial. There are some rating markets, based
on industry, geography and/or instrument type, in which Moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to S&P, while in other markets, the reverse is true.

In addition to S&P, MIS’s competitors include Fitch Ratings, Dominion Bond Rating Service, A.M. Best Company, Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd., Kroll Bond Rating
Agency Inc., Morningstar Inc. and Egan-Jones Ratings Company. In Europe, examples of competitors include Euler Hermes Rating, Feri EuroRating Services AG, Creditreform Rating AG, ICAP Group and Companhia Portuguesa de Rating. There are additional
competitors in other regions and countries, for example, in China, where Moody’s operates through a joint venture. These competitors include China Lianhe Credit Rating Co Ltd., Shanghai Brilliance Credit Rating & Investors Service Co
Ltd., Dagong Global Credit Rating Co Ltd. and Pengyuan Credit Rating Co Ltd.

MA competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified
competitors such as Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg, S&P Capital IQ, Fitch Solutions, Dun & Bradstreet, IBM, Wolters Kluwer, Sungard, SAS, Fiserv, MSCI and Markit Group among others. MA’s main competitors within RD&A include S&P
Capital IQ, CreditSights, Thomson Reuters, Intex, IHS Global Insight, BlackRock Solutions, FactSet and other providers of fixed income analytics, valuations, economic data and research. In ERS, MA faces competition from both large software providers
such as IBM Algorithmics, SunGard, SAS, Oracle, Misys, Oliver Wyman, Verisk and various other vendors and in-house solutions. Within PS, MA competes with Omega Performance, DC Gardner, and a host of financial training and education firms, and with
Evalueserve, CRISIL Global Research & Analytics, and other providers of outsourced research and professional services.

MOODY’S STRATEGY

Moody’s corporate strategy
is to be the world’s most respected authority servicing financial risk-sensitive markets. The key aspects to implement this strategy are to:

»

Defend and enhance the core ratings and research business of MIS;

»

Build MA’s position as a leading provider of risk management solutions to financial institutions; and

»

Invest in strategic growth opportunities.


MOODY’S

2013 10K


Moody’s will make investments to defend and enhance its core businesses in an attempt to position the Company to fully
capture market opportunities resulting from global debt capital market expansion and increased business investment spending. Moody’s will also make strategic investments to achieve scale in attractive financial information markets, move into
attractive product and service adjacencies where the Company can leverage its brand, extend its thought leadership and expand its geographic presence in high growth emerging markets.

To broaden the Company’s potential, MA provides a wide range of products and services to enable financial institutions to better manage risk. As such, MA adds to the
Company’s value proposition in three ways. First, MA’s subscription businesses provide a significant base of recurring revenue to offset cyclicality in ratings issuance volumes that may result in volatility to MIS revenues. Second, MA
products and services, such as financial training and professional services on research and risk management best practices, provide opportunities for entry into emerging markets before debt capital markets fully develop and present growth
opportunities for the ratings business. Finally, MA’s integrated risk management software platform embeds Moody’s solutions deep into the technology infrastructure of banks and insurance companies worldwide.

Moody’s invests in initiatives to implement the Company’s strategy, including internally-led organic development and targeted acquisitions. Example initiatives
include:

»

Enhancements to ratings quality and product extensions;

»

Investments that extend ownership and participation in JVs and strategic alliances;

»

Headcount growth to meet customer demand for new products and services;

»

Selective, bolt-on acquisitions that accelerate the ability to grow Moody’s businesses; and

»

Expansion in emerging markets.

The 2013 acquisition of Amba Investment Services is illustrative of Moody’s strategy
to pursue selective, bolt-on acquisitions and expand product and service offerings for our customers. Founded in 2003, Amba provides outsourced investment research and analytics to financial institutions, including asset managers, investment banks,
broker-dealers, insurance and alternative investment firms. The acquisition bolsters the research and analytical capabilities offered by MA through Copal.

REGULATION

MIS and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries (including by state and
local authorities). Thus, existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been
proposed or are being considered. Each of the existing, adopted, proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact Moody’s operations or
profitability, the Company’s ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings, in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which Moody’s operates.

In the EU, the CRA industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions. In 2009,
the European Parliament passed a new regulation (“CRA1”) that established an oversight regime for the CRA industry in the EU. CRA1, which required the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of CRAs operating in the EU,
became fully effective in September 2010. MIS applied for registration in August 2010 and was granted registration in October 2011. In January 2011, CRA2 established the European Securities and Markets Authority. ESMA has had direct supervisory
responsibility for the registered CRA industry throughout the EU since July 2011.

In the summer of 2013, a new set of rules that augmented the CRAs’ supervisory
framework went into effect. Commonly referred to as CRA3, these new rules, among other things:

»

impose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers;

»

require member states to adopt laws imposing liability on CRAs for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations;

»

impose mandatory rotation requirements on CRAs hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a CRA can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer;

»

impose restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed; and

»

impose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.

MOODY’S

2013 10K



Certain of the provisions of CRA3 will be subject to ESMA rule-making and it is expected that process will happen within the
year.

In December 2012, the Staff of the SEC’s Trading and Markets Division published a “Report to Congress on Assigned Credit Ratings.” In the
report, commonly referred to as the Franken Amendment Study, the SEC Staff identified several potential courses of action without endorsing any of them and noted that any changes through SEC rulemaking would require additional study of relevant
information. The timing regarding the remainder of the SEC’s rulemaking under the Financial Reform Act remains uncertain.

In light of the regulations that have
gone into effect in both the EU and the US (as well as many other countries), from time to time and as a matter of course pursuant to their enabling legislation these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe
their oversight activities over the industry. In addition, other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to
continue in the future. Finally, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria
or procedures for evaluating local issuers. If enacted, any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which MIS operates. The legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is
likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future. Management of the Company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted, the outcome of any pending or possible future legal
proceedings, or regulatory or legislative actions, or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position, financial position or results of operations of Moody’s.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Moody’s and its affiliates
own and control a variety of intellectual property, including but not limited to proprietary information, trademarks, research, software tools and applications, models and methodologies, databases, domain names, and other proprietary materials that,
in the aggregate, are of material importance to Moody’s business. Management of Moody’s believes that each of the trademarks and related corporate names, marks and logos containing the term “Moody’s” are of material
importance to the Company.

The Company, primarily through MA, licenses certain of its databases, software applications, credit risk models, training courses in
credit risk and capital markets, research and other publications and services that contain Intellectual Property to its customers. These licenses are provided pursuant to standard fee-bearing agreements containing customary restrictions and
intellectual property protections.

In addition, Moody’s licenses certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others.
Specifically, Moody’s licenses financial information (such as market and index data, financial statement data, third party research, default data, and security identifiers) as well as software development tools and libraries. The Company
obtains such technology and intellectual property rights from generally available commercial sources. Most of such technology and intellectual property is available from a variety of sources. Although certain financial information (particularly
security identifiers and certain pricing or index data) is available only from a limited number of sources, Moody’s does not believe it is dependent on any one data source for a material aspect of its business.

The Company considers its Intellectual Property to be proprietary, and Moody’s relies on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, non-disclosure
and other contractual safeguards for protection. Moody’s also pursues instances of third-party infringement of its Intellectual Property in order to protect the Company’s rights. The Company owns a single, non-material patent. None of the
Intellectual Property is subject to a specific expiration date, except to the extent that the copyright in items that the Company authors (such as credit reports, research, and other written opinions) expires pursuant to relevant law, currently 95
years from first publication in the US; and the single patent that Moody’s owns expires in 2028.

The names of Moody’s products and services referred to
herein are trademarks, service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to Moody’s or one or more of its subsidiaries.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be
carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company’s management currently deems minor or
insignificant also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. These risk factors should be read in
conjunction with the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K.

U.S. Laws and Regulations Affecting the Credit Rating Industry are Rapidly Evolving
and May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business

Moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to
extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S., including the Reform Act and the Financial Reform Act. These regulations are complex, continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time. See
“Regulation” in Part 1, Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information. These laws and regulations:

»

seek to encourage, and may result in, increased competition among rating agencies and in the credit rating business;

»

may result in alternatives to credit ratings or changes in the pricing of credit ratings;

»

restrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings;

»

increase regulatory oversight of the credit markets and CRA operations;

»

limit the number of years a CRA can rate the securities of a particular issuer;

»

provide for direct jurisdiction of the SEC over CRAs that seek NRSRO status, and grant authority to the SEC to inspect the operations of CRAs; and

»

authorize the adoption of enhanced oversight standards, new pleading standards and enhanced liability for CRAs, which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by
investors on rated securities and aggregate legal defense costs.

These laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking, could result in reduced demand
for credit ratings and increased costs, which Moody’s may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. The Company may be required
to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is
difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on Moody’s business and its customers’ businesses, and they may affect MIS’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment
process, alter the manner in which MIS’s ratings are developed, assigned and communicated, affect the manner in which MIS or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for MIS’s ratings and alter the economics of
the credit ratings business, including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies. Further, speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and
adverse legal or judicial determinations may affect Moody’s stock price. Although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally, they may affect Moody’s in a
disproportionate manner. Each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for
credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.

Financial Reforms Outside the U.S. Affecting the Credit Rating Industry May Negatively Impact
the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business

In addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations governing the industry, foreign
jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings. In particular, the EU has adopted a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the EU, and introduced a common EU regulatory
approach to oversight of CRAs. The EU has established conditions for the issuance of credit ratings, rules on the organization and conduct of CRAs—including restrictions on certain activities deemed to create a conflict of interest—and
special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments. ESMA has direct supervisory authority for CRAs in the EU.

The amendments adopted by the
European Parliament to its existing CRA regulations (generally referred to as CRA3) became effective on June 20, 2013. As adopted, CRA3, among other things, imposes: (i) various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of
sovereign issuers; (ii) requirements that member states to adopt laws imposing liability on CRAs for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations; (iii) mandatory rotation requirements on CRAs hired by
issuers of securities for ratings on resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a CRA can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer; (iv) restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are
crossed; (v) additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.

EU financial reforms could have a significant negative effect on Moody’s operations, profitability or ability to
compete, or the markets for its products and services, including in ways that Moody’s presently is unable to predict. In particular, exposure to increased liability under the EU regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated
with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact Moody’s results of operations. In addition, compliance with the amended EU regulations may increase costs of operations.

Further, Moody’s believes there is still potential for additional rulemaking by the EU and other jurisdictions that can significantly impact operations or the
markets for Moody’s products and services, such as regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated, establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings. Moody’s cannot
predict the extent of such future laws and regulations, and the effect that they will have on Moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant. Financial reforms in the EU and other foreign
jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company Faces Exposure to Litigation
Related to Rating Opinions

Moody’s faces exposure to litigation related to MIS’s ratings actions, as well as other business practices. As a result
of difficult economic times and turbulent markets in recent years, the market value of credit-dependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased. This development has led to a significant increase in the number of legal proceedings that
Moody’s is facing, including class actions and other litigation, government investigations and inquiries concerning events in the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly. Legal proceedings impose additional
expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues. Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign
jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the U.S. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden
of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify. Moody’s may not have adequate insurance
or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, to the extent that Moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation
matters proceed to trial, the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by Moody’s increase substantially, as does the risk of an adverse outcome. See “Contingencies” for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil
litigation that the Company currently faces. Due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought, there is a risk that Moody’s will be subject to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other adverse results
that could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company is Exposed to Legal, Economic and Regulatory
Risks of Operating in Foreign Jurisdictions

Moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its
revenue from foreign sources. Changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the Company operates may have an impact on the Company’s business. For example, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone or elsewhere could
affect the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas. In addition, operations abroad expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as:

»

restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into USD;

»

exposure to exchange rate movements between foreign currencies and USD;

»

the costs of repatriating cash held by entities outside the U.S.;

»

U.S. laws affecting overseas operations including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers;

»

differing legal or civil liability, compliance and regulatory standards;

»

uncertain and evolving laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industries;

»

economic, political and geopolitical market conditions;

»

the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions;

»

competition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions;

»

reduced protection for intellectual property rights;

»

longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables;

»

differing accounting principles and standards;

»

difficulties and delays in translating documentation into foreign languages; and

»

potentially adverse tax consequences.

Additionally, Moody’s is subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Although the Company has implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such
measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that the Company has violated anti-bribery or
anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to the Company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business
in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s reputation,
its ability to attract and retain employees, its business, operating results and financial condition.

Moody’s Operations and Infrastructure May
Malfunction or Fail

Moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its
businesses and the communities in which Moody’s is located, including New York City, the location of Moody’s headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which Moody’s has offices. This may include a disruption involving physical or
technological infrastructure used by the Company or third parties with or through whom Moody’s conducts business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of
vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful. The Company relies on third-party providers to provide certain
essential services. While the Company believes that such providers are reliable, the Company has limited control over the performance of such providers. To the extent any of the Company’s third-party providers ceases to provide these services
in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fail to adequately expand its services to meet the Company’s needs and the needs of the Company’s customers, the Company could experience lower revenues and higher costs. The Company also does not
have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of Moody’s locations or systems and
its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with Moody’s clients and customers may
suffer. We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to Moody’s operations or
infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company is Exposed to Risks Related to
Cybersecurity and Protection of Confidential Information

The Company’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of
confidential, sensitive and other types of information in the Company’s computer systems and networks and those of its third party vendors. The cyber risks we face range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats
that target the Company because of its prominence in the global marketplace, or due to its ratings of sovereign debt. Breaches of our or our vendors’ technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service
attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions, may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company’s or such vendors’ web sites,
applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding the Company or our business or customers. Measures that Moody’s takes to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be
expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become obsolete. Any material incidents could cause the Company to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or
financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the Company. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results or financial condition.

Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial
Markets May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business

Moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and
volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets. Furthermore, issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by non-traditional parties such as financial advisors, rather than
traditional CRAs, such as MIS. A majority of Moody’s credit-rating-based revenue is transaction-based, and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Accordingly, any
market volatility or conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar-equivalent volume of debt issuances for which Moody’s
provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to the amount of revenues that may be derived from Moody’s ratings services.

Credit market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and
the demand for credit ratings. Economic and government factors such as a long-term continuation of difficult economic conditions, uncertainty regarding the U.S. debt ceiling and a worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe may have an adverse
impact on the Company’s business. Future debt issuances could be negatively affected by a sharp increase in long-term

MOODY’S

2013 10K



interest rates or factors which cause instability or volatility in the global capital markets, such as significant regulatory, political or economic events, the use of alternative sources of
credit, including financial institutions and government sources, and defaults of significant issuers. Changes in the markets for such securities and in the role and regulation of rating agencies may materially and adversely affect the Company.

The timing, nature, extent and sustainability of any recovery in the credit and other financial markets is uncertain, and a prolonged period of market decline or weakness
could have a material adverse effect on the business. Moody’s initiatives to reduce costs may not be sufficient and further cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term, due in part to rent, technology, compliance
and other fixed costs associated with some of the Company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings. Further, the cost-reduction initiatives undertaken to date could make it difficult for the Company to rapidly expand
operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the credit markets and the resulting demand for ratings. Volatility in the financial markets, including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates, may have a
material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company Faces Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or
Customers

There is intense price competition in the credit rating, research, credit risk management markets, outsourced research and analytical services and
financial training and certification services. Competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services, as well as increased competition from non-NRSROs that evaluate
debt risk for issuers or investors. At the same time, bankruptcies, consolidation of customers, particularly those involved in structured finance products, and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors. Tepid
economic growth is also intensifying the competitive pressures as to pricing. While Moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services, it may lose market share if its pricing is not sufficiently
competitive with its current and future competitors. In addition, the Reform Act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies. The formation of additional NRSROs may increase pricing, as well as other competitive, pressures. Any
inability of Moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services could have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company is Exposed to Reputation and Credibility Concerns

Moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths. To the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or Moody’s, relative to
its competitors, suffers a loss in credibility, Moody’s business could be significantly impacted. Factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a
conflict of interest, the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities, the timing and nature of changes in ratings, a major compliance failure, negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of
ratings, regulators and legislative bodies, including as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities. Operational errors, whether by Moody’s or a Moody’s competitor, could also harm the reputation
of the Company or the credit rating industry. Damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

The Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business

The markets for credit ratings, research, credit risk management services, outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification services
are highly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Moody’s competitors
include both established companies with significant financial resources, brand recognition, market experience and technological expertise, and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to
customer requirements. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment
methods currently employed by Moody’s, or may price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by Moody’s. Customers or others may develop alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk. Such
developments could affect demand for Moody’s products and services and its growth prospects. In addition, the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive Internet information may reduce the demand for Moody’s
products and services. Moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by Moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to
provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors. Any inability of Moody to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its
business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company Has a Significant Amount of Intangible Assets

At December 31, 2013, Moody’s had $665.2 million of goodwill and $221.6 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet. Approximately 99% of these
intangibles reside in the MA business and are allocated to the four reporting units within MA: RD&A; ERS; Financial Services Training and Certifications; and Copal Amba. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of
these reporting units could result in an asset impairment charge, which would result in a non-cash charge to operating expenses. Goodwill


MOODY’S

2013 10K


and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Determining
whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be difficult as a result of increased uncertainty and current market dynamics, and requires significant management estimates and judgment. In addition, the potential for goodwill impairment is increased
during periods of economic uncertainty. An asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

Possible Loss of Key Employees and Related Compensation Cost Pressures May Negatively Impact the Company

Moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for
skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment
mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries. As greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies, in the future, Moody’s may be
required to alter its compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees. Investment banks, investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working
conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the U.S. with the required experience or
skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. There is a risk that even if the Company invests significant resources in attempting to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, it will not succeed in its efforts, and its business could be
harmed.

Moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr., the President and Chief Executive Officer, and other senior officers
and key employees. The loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and Moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a
material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

Moody’s Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions May Not
Produce Anticipated Results

Moody’s has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen its
business and grow the Company. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks. The market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect
Moody’s ability to complete such transactions. If Moody’s is unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, its business, operating results and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

If such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized, and a
variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. For instance, the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated, the Company may assume unintended liabilities, there may be unexpected
regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, the Company may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management’s focus from other business operations. The anticipated benefits from an
acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. As a result, the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on
Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

The Trading Price of Moody’s Stock Could be Affected by Third Party Actions

Ownership of Moody’s stock is highly concentrated with a significant portion of shares held by a few institutional stockholders. Due to this concentrated stockholder
base, the trading price of Moody’s stock could be affected considerably by actions of significant stockholders to increase or decrease their positions in Moody’s stock. As a result, the actions of these institutional stockholders could
create high stock volatility.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations
and inquiries, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically
assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it
may determine to be appropriate.

Following the global credit crisis of 2008, MIS and other credit rating agencies have been the subject of intense scrutiny,
increased regulation, ongoing inquiry and governmental investigations, and civil litigation. Legislative, regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation, regulation and enforcement actions, including with
respect to MIS’s compliance with newly imposed regulatory standards. Moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities and is responding to such
investigations and inquiries.

In addition, the Company is facing litigation from market participants relating to the performance of MIS rated securities. Although
Moody’s in the normal course experiences such litigation, the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased following the events in the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and global credit markets more broadly
over the last several years.

Two purported class action complaints were filed by purported purchasers of the Company’s securities against the Company and
certain of its senior officers, asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The first was filed by Raphael Nach in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 19, 2007. The second was filed by Teamsters Local
282 Pension Trust Fund in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 26, 2007. Both actions were consolidated into a single proceeding entitled In re Moody’s Corporation Securities Litigation in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 27, 2008, a consolidated amended complaint was filed, purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities during the period February 3, 2006 through
October 24, 2007. Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants issued false and/or misleading statements concerning the Company’s business conduct, business prospects, business conditions and financial results relating primarily to MIS’s
ratings of structured finance products including RMBS, CDO and constant-proportion debt obligations. The plaintiffs sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case.
The Company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in September 2008. On February 23, 2009, the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims and sustaining others. On January 22, 2010, plaintiffs moved to certify a
class of individuals who purchased Moody’s Corporation common stock between February 3, 2006 and October 24, 2007, which the Company opposed. On March 31, 2011, the court issued an opinion denying plaintiffs’ motion to
certify the proposed class. On April 14, 2011, plaintiffs filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seeking discretionary permission to appeal the decision. The Company filed its response to the petition on
April 25, 2011. On July 20, 2011, the Second Circuit issued an order denying plaintiffs’ petition for leave to appeal. On September 14, 2012, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment, which was fully briefed on
December 21, 2012. On August 23, 2013, the court issued an opinion granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Judgment was entered in Moody’s favor on August 26, 2013. On September 23, 2013, plaintiffs filed a
notice of appeal from the judgment and from the March 2011 decision denying class certification. On December 19, 2013, that appeal was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement, thereby concluding this
litigation.

On August 25, 2008, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank filed a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York asserting numerous common-law causes of action against two subsidiaries of the Company, another rating agency, and Morgan Stanley & Co. The action related to securities issued by a structured investment vehicle called Cheyne
Finance (the “Cheyne SIV”) and sought, among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. The central allegation against the rating agency defendants was that the credit ratings assigned to the securities issued by the Cheyne SIV
were false and misleading. In early proceedings, the court dismissed all claims against the rating agency defendants except those for fraud and aiding and abetting fraud. In June 2010, the court denied plaintiff’s motion for class
certification, and additional plaintiffs were subsequently added to the complaint. In January 2012, the rating agency defendants moved for summary judgment with respect to the fraud and aiding and abetting fraud claims. Also in January
2012, in light of new New York state case law, the court permitted the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint that reasserted previously dismissed claims against all defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, negligent misrepresentation,
and related aiding and abetting claims. In May 2012, the court, ruling on the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss, dismissed all of the reasserted claims except for the negligent misrepresentation claim, and on September 19,
2012, after further proceedings, the court also dismissed the negligent misrepresentation claim. On August 17, 2012, the court ruled on the rating agencies’ motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ remaining claims for fraud and
aiding and abetting fraud. The court dismissed, in whole or in part, the fraud claims of four plaintiffs as against Moody’s but allowed the fraud claims to proceed with respect to certain claims of one of those plaintiffs and the claims of the
remaining 11 plaintiffs. The court also dismissed all claims against Moody’s for aiding and abetting fraud. Three of the plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed filed motions for reconsideration, and on November 7, 2012, the court granted
two of these motions, reinstating the claims of two plaintiffs that were previously dismissed. On February 1, 2013, the court dismissed the claims of one additional plaintiff on jurisdictional grounds. Trial on the remaining fraud claims
against the rating agencies,


MOODY’S

2013 10K


and on claims against Morgan Stanley for aiding and abetting fraud and for negligent misrepresentation, was scheduled for May 2013. On April 24, 2013, pursuant to confidential settlement
agreements, the 14 plaintiffs with claims that had been ordered to trial stipulated to the voluntary dismissal, with prejudice, of these claims as against all defendants, and the Court so ordered that stipulation on April 26, 2013. The
settlement did not cover certain claims of two plaintiffs that were previously dismissed by the Court. On May 23, 2013, these two plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the Second Circuit, seeking reversal of the dismissal of their claims and
also seeking reversal of the Court’s denial of class certification. According to pleadings filed by plaintiffs in earlier proceedings, they seek approximately $76 million in total compensatory damages in connection with the two claims at issue
on the appeal.

In October 2009, plaintiffs King County, Washington and Iowa Student Loan Liquidity Corporation each filed substantially identical putative class
actions in the Southern District of New York against two subsidiaries of the Company and several other defendants, including two other rating agencies and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG. These actions arose out of investments in securities
issued by a structured investment vehicle called Rhinebridge Plc (the “Rhinebridge SIV”) and sought, among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. Each complaint asserted a claim for common law fraud against the rating agency
defendants, alleging, among other things, that the credit ratings assigned to the securities issued by the Rhinebridge SIV were false and misleading. The case was assigned to the same judge presiding over the litigation concerning the Cheyne
SIV, described above. In April 2010, the court denied the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss. In June 2010, the court consolidated the two cases and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that, among other things, added Morgan
Stanley & Co. as a defendant. In January 2012, in light of new New York state case law, the court permitted the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint that asserted claims against the rating agency defendants for breach of fiduciary duty,
negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and aiding and abetting claims. In May 2012, the court, ruling on the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss, dismissed all of the new claims except for the negligent misrepresentation claim
and a claim for aiding and abetting fraud; on September 28, 2012, after further proceedings, the court also dismissed the negligent misrepresentation claim. Plaintiffs did not seek class certification. On September 7, 2012 the rating
agencies filed a motion for summary judgment dismissing the remaining claims against them. On January 3, 2013, the Court issued an order dismissing the claim for aiding and abetting fraud against the rating agencies but allowing the claim for
fraud to proceed to trial. In June 2012 and March 2013, respectively, defendants IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (and a related entity) and Fitch, Inc. informed the court that they had executed confidential settlement agreements with the plaintiffs.
On April 24, 2013, pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement, the plaintiffs stipulated to the voluntary dismissal, with prejudice, of all remaining claims as against the remaining defendants, including Moody’s, and the Court so
ordered that stipulation on April 26, 2013.

For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes,
where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the
reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In other instances, because of
uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments
and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the
claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any
resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As
the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial
condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of
the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

This MD&A contains Forward-Looking Statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” commencing on page 58 and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” commencing
on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.

THE COMPANY

Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) software solutions and
related risk management services, (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, financial services training and certification services and (v) outsourced research and analytical services to institutional customers. Moody’s has two
reportable segments: MIS and MA.

MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such
obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors.

The MA segment, which includes all of the Company’s non-rating commercial activities, develops a wide range of products and services that primarily support financial
analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major
debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit-related events. It also provides fixed income pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region. The RD&A business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools
such as quantitative credit risk scores. Within its ERS business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. The PS business provides outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and
certification programs.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an
ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other retirement benefits, UTPs and stock-based
compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters
that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.

Pursuant to the guidance of ASC Topic 605, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its
relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

The Company’s products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under ASC Topic 605. The Company evaluates each deliverable in
an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right
relative to the delivered item, the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. In instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the delivered item is combined
with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.

The Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction
meets the VSOE criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. In instances where the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company
infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a


MOODY’S

2013 10K


reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history, the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely
similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in the Company’s market strategy from that of
its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the
Company generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASU 2009-13, when the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at
which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives,
standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions
such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.

In the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or
issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, derivatives, international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed
securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities, which was approximately 30 years on a weighted average
basis at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $97 million, $82 million and $79 million, respectively.

Multiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. In instances where monitoring
fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The Company generally uses ESP in
determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings.

MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding.
Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
accounts receivable included approximately $21 million, $22 million and $24 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings.
Furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the monitoring period, however, revenue is recognized ratably over the monitoring period.

In the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from
subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from
sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the
annual maintenance period. Revenue from services rendered within the professional services line of business is generally recognized as the services are performed. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue
is not recognized until acceptance occurs. A large portion of annual research and data subscriptions as well as annual software maintenance is invoiced in November, December and January of each year.

Products and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element arrangement
includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the
aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition previously described.

If the
arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to
determine VSOE for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an
undelivered element, the Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements. In cases where software implementation
services are considered essential and VSOE of fair value exists for post-contract customer support (“PCS”), once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a
percentage-of-completion basis as implementation services are performed, while PCS is recognized

MOODY’S

2013 10K



over the coverage period. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for PCS, once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero profit
margin basis until essential services are complete, at which point total arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining PCS coverage period.

Accounts Receivable Allowance

Moody’s records an allowance for estimated
future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts
are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable
allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic
perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve
significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments
and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

Contingencies

Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described
in the “Contingencies” section of this “MD&A”, commencing on page 56 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such
matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the then current
status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in
the future, adjust its associated liabilities.

For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes,
where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the
reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In other instances, because of
uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments
and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the
claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any
resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As
the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial
condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of
the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.

The Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the Company against certain risks including
but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation, employment practices litigation, employee medical claims and terrorism, for which the claims are not material to the Company. In addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance
subsidiary insured the Company for defense costs related to professional liability claims. For matters insured by the Company’s insurance subsidiary, Moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and
total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion. The Company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined
estimates. The Cheyne SIV and Rhinebridge SIV matters, more fully discussed in the “Contingencies” section of this MD&A, were both cases from the 2008/2009 claims period, and accordingly the defense cost for these matters were insured
by the Company’s insurance subsidiary. Defense costs for matters not self-insured by the Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided.

For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is
more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full
knowl-

edge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent
likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

On July 31 of each year, Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an
operating segment.

At July 31, 2013, the Company had five primary reporting units: one in MIS that encompasses all of Moody’s ratings operations and four
reporting units within MA: RD&A, ERS, FSTC and Copal. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, in-depth research on major debt issuers,
industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The ERS reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software licenses and related maintenance and implementation services. The FSTC
reporting unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and certification services. Copal, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011, provides outsourced
research and analytical services and was a separate reporting unit since its acquisition. On December 10, 2013, a subsidiary of the Company acquired Amba Investment Services which was combined with Copal to form the Copal Amba reporting unit.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a three-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses
various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a determination is made that, based on the qualitative factors, an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to
perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting
unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to
perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied
fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less
than its carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. For the reporting units where the Company is consistently able to conclude on impairment using only a qualitative approach, the Company’s accounting policy is to
perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years. At July 31, 2013, the Company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on all reporting units, which resulted in no
impairment of goodwill.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and appropriate comparable market
metrics. The Company bases its fair value estimates on reasonable assumptions. However, as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, actual future results may differ from these estimates. In addition, the Company
also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.

Goodwill
is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units, and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Other assets and
liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.

Sensitivity Analyses and Key Assumptions for Deriving the Fair Value of a Reporting Unit

The following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of December 31, 2013 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each
reporting unit would exceed the fair value under Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350 as of July 31, 2013, assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values.

Prior to the acquisition of Amba, a hypothetical reduction to the fair value of the Copal reporting unit of up to 40% would not have resulted in the reporting unit’s carrying value to exceed its fair value.

As can be seen from the table above, the reporting unit most at risk for potential impairment is the FSTC reporting unit and failure to meet its
financial projections could result in further goodwill impairment (there was a goodwill impairment charge of $12.2 million for this reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2012). This business is, in part, sensitive to the staffing levels and
profitability of the global financial services industry, particularly in Canada and EMEA.

The ERS reporting unit also carries some risk of potential impairment.
Management of the ERS reporting unit is currently focused on expanding market penetration as well as enhancing the scalability of its products and services. While the business continues to expand its customer footprint, operating margins are
expected to remain lower than previously anticipated.

There could be a future goodwill impairment charge if FSTC fails or ERS significantly fails to meet its current
financial projections.

Methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units:

The following is a discussion regarding the Company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units as of July 31, 2013.

The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. The DCF
analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted
average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to
reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from
the acquisition. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions or realignments.

: The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit.
These projections are consistent with the Company’s operating and strategic plan. Cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis were utilized in the determination of fair value for each
reporting unit. The growth rates utilized in the projections assumed a gradual increase in revenue from financial service customers based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets, new customer acquisition and new
products. Beyond five years a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real GDP growth rates. A sensitivity analysis of the growth rates was performed on all reporting units. For all reporting units, a 10%
decrease in the growth rates used would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value.

»

WACC

: The WACC is the rate used to discount each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows. The WACC is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity
is based on a risk-free interest rate adjusted for an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit’s cash
flows. The cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the Company’s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the WACC. The cost of debt
and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. The WACC for all reporting units ranged from 10% to 11.5% as of July 31, 2013.
Differences in the WACC used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. A sensitivity analysis of the WACC was performed on all reporting units as of
July 31, 2013. For the FSTC reporting unit, an increase in the WACC of one percentage point would have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value by approximately $5 million under step one of the
goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350. For the remaining reporting units, an increase in the WACC of one percentage point would not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There
were no such events or changes during 2013 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the Company’s reporting units may not be recoverable. This determination was made based on improving market
conditions for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides and an assessment of projected cash flows for all reporting units. Additionally, there were no events or circumstances during the 2013 that would indicate the need for an
adjustment of the remaining useful lives of these amortizable intangible assets.

Pension and Other Retirement Benefits

The expenses, assets and liabilities that Moody’s reports for its Retirement Plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and
circumstances. These assumptions include the following:

»

future compensation increases, based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook

»

long-term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of
equity and fixed-income investments)

»

future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near-term outlooks and assessments of likely long-term trends

»

discount rates, based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds

The discount rates selected to measure
the present value of the Company’s benefit obligation for its Retirement Plans as of December 31, 2013 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with
the corresponding yield on the Citibank pension discount curve. The cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.

Moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the
Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a
significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s Retirement Plans.

When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions
used, actuarial gains or losses arise. Excluding differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets, the Company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding gains or
losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value

of plan assets. For Moody’s Retirement Plans, the total actuarial losses as of December 31, 2013 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $95.2 million, and Moody’s
expects to recognize a net periodic expense of $6.0 million in 2014 related to the amortization of actuarial losses.

For Moody’s funded U.S. pension plan, the
differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under ASC Topic 715, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five-year
period for purposes of calculating the market-related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of
December 31, 2013, the Company has an unrecognized asset gain of $8.2 million, of which $1.8 million will be recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2015
expense.

The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody’s 2014 operating
income. These effects have been calculated using the Company’s current projections of 2014 expenses, assets and liabilities related to Moody’s Retirement Plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.

A one
percentage-point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2014 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to Retirement Plans will be $29.6 million in 2014 compared with $34.6
million in 2013. The expected expense decrease in 2014 reflects the effects of lower benefit obligations primarily due to higher discount rate assumptions, and lower amortization of actuarial losses.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records compensation expense for all
share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes stock options and restricted stock. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based
in part on Moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards
and related expense.

An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2013 (dollars in millions):

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income
taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions. The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary
differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.

The Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve Legacy Tax and other tax matters. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such
audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for UTPs. The Company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if
any, as part of other non-operating expenses.


MOODY’S

2013 10K


For UTPs, ASC Topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of
more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position
that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of
liabilities related to UTPs and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual
outcomes could have a material impact on the Company’s operating results or financial condition.

For certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, the Company has
deemed the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations. Accordingly, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. It is not
practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

Other Estimates

In addition, there are other accounting estimates within
Moody’s consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions
and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected
in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact Moody’s.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

The Company is organized into two
reportable segments at December 31, 2013: MIS and MA. The MIS segment is comprised of all of the Company’s ratings activities. All of Moody’s other non-rating commercial activities are included in the MA segment.

The MIS segment consists of four lines of business – corporate finance, structured finance, financial institutions and public, project and infrastructure finance
– that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide.

The MA segment, which includes all of the Company’s non-rating commercial activities, develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis
and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. The MA segment consists of three lines of business – RD&A, ERS and PS. In the first quarter of 2013, a portion of a division within the PS LOB that
provides solutions for structured finance securities was transferred to the RD&A LOB. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2012, a division within the PS LOB that provides various financial modeling services was transferred to the ERS LOB.
Accordingly, the prior year revenue by LOB for MA has been reclassified to reflect these transfers.

In December 2013, a subsidiary of the Company acquired Amba, a
provider of investment research and quantitative analytics for global financial institutions. In the fourth quarter of 2011, subsidiaries of the Company acquired B&H and a majority interest in Copal. B&H is a provider of insurance risk
management tools. Copal is an outsourced research and consulting business. Amba, B&H and Copal are part of the MA segment and B&H’s revenue is included in the ERS LOB while Amba and Copal’s revenue is included in the PS LOB.

The following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments, including the intersegment royalty revenue for MIS and expense charged to MA for the rights
to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. The royalty rate charged by MIS approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content, data and products developed by MIS. The discussion also includes intersegment fees charged
to MIS from MA for the use of certain MA products and services in MIS’s ratings process. These fees charged by MA are generally equal to the costs incurred by MA to provide these products and services. Overhead charges and corporate expenses
which exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company which benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology.
Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resources and information technology.

Beginning on January 1, 2013, the Company refined its methodology for allocating certain overhead departments to its segments to better align the costs allocated
based on each segment’s usage of the overhead service. The refined methodology is reflected in the segment results for the year ended December 31, 2013, and accordingly, the segment results for the prior year comparative periods have been
reclassified to conform to the new presentation. These reclassifications were not material.

Year ended December 31, 2013 compared with year ended December 31, 2012

Executive Summary

Moody’s revenue in 2013 totaled $2,972.5 million,
an increase of $242.2 million compared to 2012 and reflected good growth in both reportable segments, most notably in the high-yield and bank loan sectors of CFG within MIS and within all LOBs within MA. Total expenses, which included the settlement
of the Abu Dhabi and Rhinebridge litigation matters more fully discussed in the “Contingencies” section of this MD&A, increased $85.0 million compared to the prior year which included a $12.2 million goodwill impairment charge relating
to the Company’s FSTC reporting unit within MA. The increase in expenses also reflected higher salaries and benefit costs of $56.2 million primarily relating to headcount growth and annual compensation increases. These increases were partially
offset by lower incentive compensation costs of $30.3 million. Operating income of $1,234.6 million increased $157.2 million compared to 2012 and resulted in an operating margin of 41.5% in 2013, compared to 39.5% in the prior year. Adjusted
Operating Income of $1,328.0 million in 2013 increased $144.9 million compared to 2012 resulting in an Adjusted Operating Margin of 44.7% compared to 43.3% in the prior year period. Diluted EPS of $3.60 in 2013, which includes a $0.14 charge in the
first quarter related to the aforementioned settlement of two litigation matters and a $0.09 benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter in the fourth quarter of 2013, increased $0.55 over the prior year period, which included a $0.06 benefit relating to a
Legacy Tax Matter. Excluding the litigation settlement in the first quarter of 2013 and the benefits from Legacy Tax Matters in both years, Non-GAAP Diluted EPS was $3.65, or $0.66 higher than $2.99 in 2012.

Total as of December 31, 2013 includes 971 staff from the fourth quarter 2013 acquisition of Amba, of which a significant portion are based in low cost jurisdictions.

Global revenue of $2,972.5 million in 2013 increased $242.2 million compared to 2012 reflecting good growth in both reportable segments. The increase in ratings revenue
reflects benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, primarily in the U.S., coupled with higher global rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans. The growth in MA
reflects higher revenue across all LOBs, most notably in RD&A, which benefited from solid demand for data and analytic products, and in ERS which was driven by the completion of certain software implementations. Transaction revenue accounted for
50% of global MCO revenue in both 2013 and 2012.

U.S. revenue of $1,626.5 million increased $154.1 million over 2012, reflecting growth across all ratings LOBs, most
notably in CFG and SFG, coupled with growth in all LOBs within MA.

Non-U.S. revenue increased $88.1 million compared to 2012, reflecting higher CFG revenue in all
regions coupled with increases in MA revenue within the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. These increases were partially offset by declines in all asset classes in SFG within the EMEA region.

Operating expenses were $822.4 million in 2013, an increase of $27.4 million from 2012 and reflected growth in both compensation and non-compensation costs. The increase
in compensation costs of approximately $11 million reflects higher salaries and related employee benefits of approximately $30 million primarily resulting from increases in headcount as well as the impact of annual compensation increases. These
increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation of approximately $21 million due to lower achievement against full-year targeted results in 2013 compared to 2012. The growth in non-compensation expenses of approximately $17 million
is primarily due to an increase in costs relating to ongoing IT initiatives coupled with higher variable costs correlated with business growth.

SG&A expenses of
$822.1 million in 2013 increased $69.9 million from 2012 with the primary driver of the expense growth reflecting the settlement of the Abu Dhabi and Rhinebridge litigation matters more fully discussed in the “Contingencies” section of
this MD&A. The remaining increase in SG&A expenses reflects growth in compensation costs of approximately $18 million primarily due to higher salaries and related employee benefits of approximately $26 million resulting from annual
compensation increases and headcount growth in sales personnel within MA as well as in overhead support areas. The growth in salaries and related employee benefits was partially offset by lower incentive compensation of $10 million due to lower
achievement against full-year targeted results in 2013 compared to 2012. Additionally, there was a decline in non-compensation expenses (excluding the aforementioned settlement for litigation matters) which primarily reflected lower legal defense
costs in 2013 following the first quarter litigation settlement. These declines were partially offset by higher costs for ongoing IT initiatives coupled with higher contingent consideration costs of approximately $7 million relating to the
acquisition of Copal.

Operating income of $1,234.6 million increased $157.2 million from 2012. Adjusted Operating Income was $1,328.0 million in 2013 and increased
$144.9 million compared to 2012. Operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin of 41.5% and 44.7%, respectively, increased 200bps and 140bps, respectively, compared to the prior year. The increased margins reflected good revenue growth in both
reportable segments outpacing operating expense growth.

Interest income (expense), net in 2013 was ($91.8) million, a $28.0 million increase in expense compared to
2012. This increase is due to higher interest on borrowings reflecting the issuance of the 2012 Senior Notes and the 2013 Senior Notes in August 2012 and 2013, respectively, partially offset by lower interest expense due to the final repayment of
the 2008 Term Loan in May 2013. Also, the increase in expense reflects an approximate $7 million reversal of interest on UTPs in 2012 related to the settlement of state and local tax audits.

Other non-operating income (expense), net was $26.5 million in 2013, a $16.1 million increase in income compared to 2012 and reflected approximately $6 million in FX
losses in 2012 compared to immaterial gains in 2013. The FX losses in 2012 primarily related to the decline of the euro relative to the British pound in the prior year. Also contributing to the increase in income was a higher Legacy Tax benefit in
2013 compared to 2012 ($19.2 million in 2013 compared to $12.8 million in 2012).

MOODY’S

2013 10K



The Company’s ETR was 30.2% in 2013, down from 31.7% in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to U.S. tax legislation
enacted in early 2013 which retroactively extended certain tax benefits to the 2012 tax year and prospectively extended these benefits to the 2013 tax year as well as tax benefits on the aforementioned litigation settlement charge.

Net Income in 2013 was $804.5 million, or $3.60 per diluted share, and included a $0.14 charge related to the aforementioned litigation settlement in the first quarter of
2013 as well as a $0.09 benefit relating to the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter. This is an increase of $114.5 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to 2012, which included a $0.06 benefit relating to a Legacy Tax Matter. Excluding the
charge for the litigation settlement in 2013 and the Legacy Tax benefits in both years, Non-GAAP Diluted EPS of $3.65 in 2013 was $0.66 higher than in the same period of the prior year.

The following is a discussion of external MIS revenue and operating expenses:

Global MIS revenue of $2,059.4 million in 2013 increased $172.6 million compared to 2012, reflecting growth in all ratings LOBs excluding SFG, which was flat compared to
the prior year. The drivers of the growth include changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, primarily in the U.S. and an increase in rated issuance volumes for speculative-grade corporate debt and bank loans,
particularly in the first half of 2013, coupled with higher U.S. CMBS and REIT issuance. These increases were partially offset by declines across all asset classes within SFG in EMEA. Transaction revenue for MIS was 62% of total MIS revenue in both
2013 and 2012.

In the U.S., revenue was $1,216.7 million in 2013, an increase of $103.9 million, or 9% compared to 2012 reflecting changes in the mix of fee type,
new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases as well as strong growth in rated issuance volumes for bank loans, CMBS, REITs and CLOs. Higher revenue from monitoring fees in CFG also contributed to the growth.

Non-U.S. revenue was $842.7 million in 2013, an increase of $68.7 million compared to 2012 reflecting changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain
pricing increases as well as higher revenue from rating high-yield corporate debt and bank loans across all regions. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in rated issuance volumes across most asset classes in SFG within the EMEA
region.

Global CFG revenue of $996.8 million in 2013 increased $139.2 million from 2012 reflecting changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain
pricing increases, primarily in the U.S. as well as growth in rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans, particularly in the first half of 2013. The increase in high-yield corporate debt and bank loans largely reflected
issuers taking advantage of the overall low interest rate environment to issue new debt as well as to refinance existing borrowings combined


MOODY’S

2013 10K


with increased investor appetite for higher-yielding fixed income securities. Monitoring and program fee revenue also increased due to growth in the number of outstanding rated issuances.
Transaction revenue represented 73% of total CFG revenue in 2013, compared to 74% in 2012. In the U.S., revenue in 2013 was $613.2 million, or $51.4 million higher than 2012. Internationally, revenue of $383.6 million in 2013 increased $87.8 million
compared to 2012.

Global SFG revenue of $382.5 million in 2013 was flat compared to 2012 reflecting an increase in rated issuance volumes for CMBS, REITs and CLOs in
the U.S. coupled with the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases. These increases were offset by declines across all asset classes in EMEA. Transaction revenue was 60% of total SFG
revenue in 2013 compared to 58% in 2012. In the U.S., revenue of $244.7 million increased $37.3 million compared to the same period in 2012, reflecting the aforementioned growth in CLO, CMBS and REIT rated issuance volumes due to favorable market
conditions. Non-U.S. revenue in 2013 of $137.8 million decreased $35.8 million compared to 2012 reflecting declines across all asset classes in the EMEA region, most notably in RMBS and ABS. The decline in EMEA RMBS and ABS was primarily due to
depressed issuance levels reflecting banks use of unsecured financing in preference to securitized funding conduits, coupled with their balance sheets being well funded from the ECB and other government sponsored funding programs (e.g. the
ECB’s long-term refinancing operation).

Global FIG revenue of $338.8 million in 2013 was $13.3 million higher compared to 2012 due to benefits from changes in
the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as growth in banking-related revenue in the U.S. The growth in banking-related revenue reflects higher issuance volumes from specialty finance, financial leasing and securities
holding companies due to favorable market conditions. Additionally, the increase reflected higher insurance revenue, most notably in EMEA, primarily reflecting issuers opportunistically refinancing debt amidst favorable interest rate conditions
coupled with issuance to fund M&A activity in the sector, particularly in the first half of 2013. Transaction revenue was 35% of total FIG revenue in 2013 compared to 37% in the same period in 2012. In the U.S. and internationally, revenue was
$143.4 million and $195.4 million, respectively, in 2013, or 6% and 3% higher, respectively, compared to 2012.

Global PPIF revenue was $341.3 million in 2013, an
increase of $18.6 million compared to 2012, reflecting benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as increases in U.S. project and infrastructure finance rated issuance volumes. Partially
offsetting these increases was a decline in U.S. public finance issuance reflecting lower municipal bond refunding volumes due to higher borrowing costs associated with increases in benchmark interest rates for U.S. Treasury Bonds beginning in May
2013. Transaction revenue was 60% and 61% of total PPIF revenue in 2013 and 2012, respectively. In the U.S., revenue in 2013 was $215.4 million and increased $6.8 million compared to 2012. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue increased $11.8 million
compared to 2012.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2013 increased $55.2 million compared to 2012 primarily due to growth in non-compensation costs of approximately
$56 million, for which the primary driver was the settlement of the Abu Dhabi and Rhinebridge litigation matters more fully discussed in the “Contingencies” section of this MD&A. Compensation costs were flat compared to the prior year
reflecting higher salaries and related employee benefits costs of approximately $31 million resulting from annual compensation increases, headcount growth in the ratings LOBs as well as in support areas such as IT, finance and human resources for
which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. This increase was offset by an approximate $32 million decline in incentive compensation which was primarily due to lower achievement against full-year targeted
results in 2013 compared to 2012.

Adjusted Operating Income in 2013, which includes intersegment royalty revenue, intersegment expenses and the aforementioned
litigation settlement charge was $1,115.4 million, an increase of $124.7 million compared to 2012. Operating income in 2013 of $1,068.8 million increased $122.3 million from 2012. Adjusted Operating Margin and operating margin were 52.2% and 50.0%,
respectively, or 160bps and 170 bps higher compared to 2012.

The following is a discussion of external MA revenue and operating expenses:

Global MA revenue increased $69.6 million compared to 2012, with good growth across all LOBs. Recurring revenue comprised 78% and 77% of total MA revenue in 2013 and
2012, respectively.

In the U.S., revenue of $409.8 million in 2013 increased $50.2 million, and reflected growth across all three LOBs. International revenue of
$503.3 million in 2013 was $19.4 million higher than in 2012.

Global RD&A revenue, which comprised 58% of total external MA revenue in both 2013 and 2012,
increased $38.8 million over the prior year period. The growth was primarily due to increased sales of the CreditView product and solid growth from other data and analytic products as well as general market price increases.

Global ERS revenue in 2013 increased $19.9 million over 2012, primarily due to revenue from the sale and implementation of regulatory and compliance software to various
financial institutions. This growth is primarily due to demand for solutions to comply with an increasingly complex regulatory environment in the banking industry. Revenue in ERS is subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature
of project timing and the concentration of revenue in a relatively small number of engagements.

Revenue from PS, which included approximately $2 million in revenue
from the acquisition of Amba, increased $10.9 million compared to 2012, reflecting growth in revenue from Copal being partially offset by softness in the FSTC reporting unit. This growth in revenue from Copal reflects further penetration into the
market for outsourced research and analytical services. If the FSTC reporting unit does not achieve its financial forecast it could result in a goodwill impairment charge in future quarters.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2013 increased $42.1 million compared to 2012 reflecting both higher compensation and non-compensation costs of approximately $29
million and $13 million, respectively. The increase in compensation costs reflects higher headcount to support business growth coupled with annual compensation increases as well as higher headcount in support areas for which the costs are allocated
to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. The increase in non-compensation expenses is primarily due to higher contingent consideration costs of approximately $7 million relating to the acquisition of Copal and higher professional
service fees of approximately $7 million related to product delivery.

Adjusted Operating Income was $212.6 million in 2013 and increased $20.2 million compared to
the same period in 2012. Operating income of $165.8 million in 2013, which includes intersegment revenue and expenses, increased $34.9 million compared to the same period in 2012, which included a $12.2 million goodwill impairment charge. Adjusted
Operating Margin for 2013 was 23.0%, compared


MOODY’S

2013 10K


to 22.5% in 2012. Operating margin was 17.9%, or 260bps higher compared to the prior year, with the higher margin in 2013 reflecting the absence of the aforementioned goodwill impairment charge
and good revenue growth outpacing expense growth.

Year ended December 31, 2012 compared with year ended December 31, 2011

Executive Summary

Moody’s revenue in 2012 totaled $2,730.3 million,
an increase of $449.6 million compared to 2011 and reflected strong growth in both reportable segments. Excluding the unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates, revenue in 2012 increased $495.5 million compared to 2011. Total expenses
were $1,652.9 million, and increased $260.6 million compared to the prior year and reflected both higher compensation and non-compensation costs, a full-year of expenses related to the fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions of Copal and B&H and a
$12.2 million goodwill impairment charge relating to the Company’s FSTC reporting unit within MA. Operating income of $1,077.4 million in 2012, which included the aforementioned goodwill impairment charge, increased $189.0 million compared to
2011 and resulted in an operating margin of 39.5% in 2012 compared to 39.0% in the prior year period. Adjusted Operating Income of $1,183.1 million in 2012 increased $215.5 million compared to 2011 resulting in an Adjusted Operating Margin of 43.3%
compared to 42.4% in the prior year period. Diluted EPS of $3.05 in 2012, which included a $0.06 per share benefit related to the favorable resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter, increased $0.56 over the prior year period, which included a $0.03 per
share benefit related to favorable resolutions of Legacy Tax Matters as well as other tax benefits totaling $0.09 per share. Excluding the aforementioned impacts related to the favorable resolutions of Legacy Tax Matters in both years, Non-GAAP
Diluted EPS in 2012 increased $0.53 per share compared to the prior year.

Includes approximately 1,600 and 1,300 personnel as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, relating to the 2011 MA acquisitions, of which a majority are in low-cost jurisdictions.

Global revenue of $2,730.3 million in 2012 increased $449.6 million compared to 2011 reflecting strong growth in both segments. The increase in ratings revenue compared
to 2011 reflects growth across all ratings LOBs, most notably in CFG. The growth in MA reflects higher revenue across all LOBs and includes revenue from Copal and B&H, which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011. Transaction revenue
accounted for 50% and 46% of global MCO revenue in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

U.S. revenue of $1,472.4 million increased $295.4 million over 2011, primarily
reflecting growth across all ratings LOBs, most notably in CFG, coupled with growth in all LOBs within MA. Also contributing to the growth were changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases in the MIS segment.

Non-U.S. revenue increased $154.2 million over 2011, reflecting strong growth in PS and ERS revenue within MA due to the acquisitions of Copal and B&H in the
fourth quarter of 2011 as well as higher MIS revenue from rating investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate debt. Changes in FX translation rates had an approximate $45 million unfavorable impact on non-U.S. revenue in 2012.

Operating expenses were $795.0 million in 2012, an increase of $111.5 million from 2011 and reflected an increase in both compensation and non-compensation costs. The
increase in compensation costs of approximately $96 million reflects higher salaries and related employee benefits resulting from increases in headcount which includes the fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions of Copal and B&H as well as higher
headcount in both the MIS and MA base business. Also contributing to the increase in salaries and related employee benefits was the impact of annual merit increases. Additionally, the increase in compensation expense is due to higher incentive
compensation reflecting greater achievement against full-year targeted results compared to achievement in the prior year period. The increase in non-compensation costs of approximately $16 million is primarily due to higher costs to support
investment in IT infrastructure.

SG&A expenses of $752.2 million in 2012 increased $122.6 million from 2011 and reflected increases in both compensation and
non-compensation expenses. Compensation costs increased approximately $73 million primarily due to higher salaries and related employee benefits which reflects annual merit increases and headcount growth in sales personnel within MA as well as in
the support areas of compliance and IT. Also, the growth in compensation expenses reflects a full-year of costs for Copal and B&H which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011. Additionally, the increase in compensation expense is due to
higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement against full-year targeted results compared to achievement in the prior year period. Non-compensation expenses increased approximately $49 million over 2011 primarily reflecting higher
legal defense costs for certain matters which are more fully discussed in the “Contingencies” section of this MD&A below. The increase compared to 2011 also reflects a full-year of expenses relating to the fourth quarter 2011
acquisitions of Copal and B&H as well as investments in IT infrastructure and higher variable costs to support business growth.

The goodwill impairment charge of
$12.2 million relates to the FSTC reporting unit within MA. This impairment resulted from a decline in projected cash flows for this reporting unit as many individuals and global financial institutions have reduced spending on training and
certification services amidst macroeconomic uncertainties in North America and EMEA.

Depreciation and amortization of $93.5 million in 2012 increased $14.3 million
from 2011 reflecting higher amortization of: i) internal use software; and ii) intangible assets acquired as part of the fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions of Copal and B&H.

Operating income of $1,077.4 million increased $189.0 million from 2011, reflecting revenue growth outpacing the increase in total expenses. Adjusted Operating Income was
$1,183.1 million in 2012 and increased $215.5 million compared to 2011. Operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin in 2012 of 39.5% and 43.3%, respectively, increased 50bps and 90bps, respectively, compared to the prior year, and reflected
revenue growth exceeding expense growth. Changes in FX translation rates had an approximate $30 million unfavorable impact on both operating income and Adjusted Operating Income in 2012.

Interest income (expense), net in 2012 was ($63.8) million, a $1.7 million increase in expense compared to 2011. This increase is primarily due to higher interest on
borrowings reflecting the issuance of the 2012 Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2012 partially offset by an approximate $7 million reversal of interest on UTPs in 2012 due to the settlement of state and local tax audits.


MOODY’S

2013 10K


Other non-operating income (expense), net was $10.4 million in 2012, or $3.1 million lower compared to 2011 and reflected
approximately $6 million in FX losses in 2012 compared to FX gains of approximately $3 million in 2011. The FX losses in 2012 related primarily to the decline of the euro relative to the British pound. The FX losses were partially offset by a higher
Legacy Tax benefit in 2012 compared to 2011 ($12.8 million in 2012 compared to $6.4 million in 2011).

The Company’s ETR was 31.7% in 2012, up slightly from
31.2% in 2011. The increase was primarily due to the reversal of UTPs in the prior year resulting from a foreign tax ruling as well as benefits from the settlement of state tax audits in 2011. These items were partially offset by the favorable
impact of tax planning initiatives in 2012.

Net Income in 2012 was $690.0 million, or $3.05 per diluted share and included a $12.8 million benefit from the favorable
settlement of a Legacy Tax Matter and a $12.2 million goodwill impairment charge. This is an increase of $118.6 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to 2011 when Net Income included a $7.0 million net benefit, or $0.03 per diluted share,
relating to the favorable resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter as well as other tax benefits totaling $0.09. Excluding benefits from the favorable resolutions of Legacy Tax Matters in both 2012 and 2011, Non-GAAP Diluted EPS increased $0.53 per diluted
share, compared to the prior year.

The following is a discussion of external MIS revenue and operating expenses:

Global MIS revenue of $1,886.8 million in 2012 increased $317.9 million compared to 2011 and reflected growth in all ratings LOBs. The growth over the prior year period
reflected robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as investment-grade corporate debt. Additionally, the growth reflects higher rated issuance within public finance. The growth also reflected changes in the
mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, primarily in the U.S. Transaction revenue for MIS was 62% and 58% in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

In the U.S., revenue was $1,112.9 million in 2012, an increase of $233.8 million, or 27% compared to 2011. The increase reflects the aforementioned robust rated issuance
volumes in the high-yield and investment-grade corporate debt sectors as well as the public finance sector. The increase also reflects growth in rated issuance volumes for CMBS within SFG and the aforementioned changes in the mix of fee type, new
fee initiatives and certain pricing increases.

MOODY’S

2013 10K



Non-U.S. revenue was $773.9 million in 2012, an increase of $84.1 million compared to 2011. The growth over 2011 reflects
higher rated issuance volumes for investment grade corporate debt as well as high-yield corporate debt and bank loans across all regions. Additionally, there was higher banking-related revenue across all regions coupled with higher infrastructure
finance issuance in EMEA. Also contributing to the growth over 2011 were benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases. Partially offsetting these increases were declines across most asset classes
within SFG in the EMEA region. Changes in FX translation rates had an approximate $37 million unfavorable impact on non-U.S. MIS revenue in 2012.

Global CFG revenue
of $857.6 million in 2012 increased $205.5 million from 2011 reflecting growth in rated issuance volumes for high-yield and investment-grade corporate debt across all regions as well as an increase in both monitoring fees as well as fees for
commercial paper and medium term note programs. Also contributing to the growth in revenue were changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, primarily in the U.S. The aforementioned higher rated issuance volumes
for investment grade corporate debt largely reflected issuers taking advantage of the overall low interest rate environment to issue new debt as well as refinance existing borrowings. The increase in U.S. rated issuance volumes in the high-yield
sector reflects the current low interest rate environment coupled with an increase in investor demand for higher-yielding securities. Transaction revenue represented 74% of total CFG revenue in 2012, compared to 71% in 2011. In the U.S., revenue in
2012 was $561.8 million, or $139.5 million higher than 2011. Internationally, revenue of $295.8 million in 2012 increased $66.0 million compared to 2011. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates had an approximate $14 million impact on
international CFG revenue in 2012.

Global SFG revenue of $381.0 million in 2012 increased $36.4 million compared to 2011 and reflected higher rated issuance volumes
across most asset classes in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by revenue declines in all asset classes in the EMEA region. The aforementioned increases in the U.S. resulted in transaction revenue increasing to 58% of total SFG revenue
in 2012 compared to 52% in 2011. In the U.S., revenue of $207.4 million increased $45.8 million compared to 2011, reflecting growth in REIT, CMBS, collateralized loan obligation and asset-backed securities rated issuance volumes. The growth in these
asset classes reflects the current low interest rate environment and narrow credit spreads for these securities. The growth in CMBS rated issuance volumes also reflects increasing activity in bank conduit operations. Non-U.S. revenue in 2012 of
$173.6 million decreased $9.4 million compared to 2011. This decrease was primarily due to lower asset-backed securities issuance in EMEA reflecting strong issuance in 2011 when issuers were requesting a second rating for these securities in the
first quarter of 2011, which was a new requirement by the ECB for existing asset-backed securities that could be used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. The decrease also reflects lower covered bond issuance in the EMEA region reflecting
continued macroeconomic uncertainties in Europe. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates had an approximate $11 million impact on international SFG revenue in 2012.

Global FIG revenue of $325.5 million in 2012 was $30.6 million higher compared to 2011 reflecting higher banking-related issuance in the U.S. as well as the Asia and
Americas regions coupled with benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases, primarily in the U.S. Also contributing to the increase was higher insurance revenue in the U.S. reflecting issuers
opportunistically refinancing debt amidst favorable interest rate conditions coupled with issuance to fund M&A activity in the sector. Transaction revenue was 37% of total FIG revenue in 2012 compared to 34% in 2011. In the U.S. and
internationally, revenue was $135.0 million and $190.5 million, respectively, for 2012, or 14% and 8% higher, respectively, compared to 2011. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates had an approximate $8 million impact on international FIG
revenue in 2012.

Global PPIF revenue was $322.7 million in 2012, an increase of $45.4 million compared to 2011, primarily reflecting both increases in U.S. public
and project finance rated issuance volumes as well as the favorable impact of the aforementioned changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases, primarily in the U.S. Revenue generated from new transactions was 61% and 58%
of total PPIF revenue in 2012 and 2011, respectively. In the U.S., revenue in 2012 was $208.7 million and increased $32.2 million compared to 2011 and reflected higher rated issuance volumes in PFG and project finance as well as the aforementioned
pricing increases. The increase in rated issuance volumes within PFG reflects issuers opportunistically refinancing obligations ahead of scheduled maturities in the current low interest rate environment as well as a challenging prior year period
when issuance had declined reflecting the expiration of the Build America Bond Program in the fourth quarter of 2010. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue increased 13% compared to 2011 due to growth in infrastructure finance rated issuance volumes in the
EMEA region which reflects a partial easing of macroeconomic concerns following the ECB’s bond purchasing program announced in the third quarter of 2012. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates had an approximate $5 million impact on
international PPIF revenue in 2012.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2012 increased $134.1 million compared to 2011 and reflected increases in compensation and
non-compensation costs of approximately $87 million and $47 million, respectively. The increase in compensation costs reflects higher salaries and employee benefits resulting from annual merit increases, headcount growth in the ratings LOBs as well
as in support areas such as IT, finance and human resources for which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. The increase in compensation costs is also due to higher incentive compensation which reflects
greater achievement against full-year 2012 targeted results compared to achievement in 2011. Compensation costs also increased due to higher pension expense resulting from a decrease in the discount rate used to value the Company’s obligation
and higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase in non-


MOODY’S

2013 10K


compensation expenses reflected higher costs resulting from the Company’s continued investment in improving IT infrastructure and regulatory and compliance initiatives coupled with higher
variable costs reflecting improving business conditions. Additionally, the increase in non-compensation expenses reflects higher legal defense costs relating to ongoing matters, which are more fully discussed in the “Contingencies” section
of this MD&A.

Adjusted Operating Income in 2012 was $990.7 million, an increase of $188.3 million compared to 2011. Operating income in 2012 of $946.5 million,
which includes intersegment royalty revenue and intersegment expenses, increased $185.3 million from 2011 and reflects the $323.6 million increase in total MIS revenue outpacing the $135.3 million increase in total expenses. Adjusted Operating
Margin and operating margin and were 50.6% and 48.4%, respectively, or 150bps and 180bps higher compared to 2011 reflecting revenue growth exceeding the increase in expenses.

The following is a discussion of external MA revenue and operating expenses:

Global MA revenue increased $131.7 million compared to 2011, with 60% of the growth generated internationally, and included revenue from Copal and B&H which were
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011. Recurring revenue comprised 77% of total MA revenue in 2012 compared to 80% in 2011.

In the U.S., revenue of $359.6 million
in 2012 increased $61.6 million, and reflected growth across all three LOBs. International revenue of $483.9 million in 2012 was $70.1 million higher than in 2011, and reflected growth across all LOBs.

Global RD&A revenue, which comprised 58% and 64% of MA external revenue in 2012 and 2011, respectively, increased $39.3 million in 2012. The growth was primarily due
to increased sales of credit research via the CreditView product and solid growth from other data and analytic products. Global ERS revenue in 2012 increased $46.5 million over 2011, due to revenue from the acquisition of B&H in the fourth
quarter of 2011 coupled with good growth in the base business. Revenue from the PS LOB increased $45.9 million compared to 2011, with substantially all of the growth reflecting the acquisition of Copal in the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenue in the
ERS and PS LOBs are subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of revenue in a relatively small number of engagements.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2012 increased $100.0 million compared to 2011 reflecting both higher compensation and non-compensation costs of approximately $82
million and $18 million, respectively. The increase in compensation costs reflects an increase in headcount relating to the acquisitions of Copal and B&H in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as to support business growth coupled with annual
merit increases. The increase in non-compensation costs reflects expenses related to the acquisitions of Copal and B&H which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as increases in certain variable costs that are correlated with
business growth.

Depreciation and amortization of $49.3 million in 2012 increased $11.3 million from 2011 reflecting higher amortization
related to intangible assets acquired as part of the fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions of Copal and B&H.

The goodwill impairment charge of $12.2 million relates
to the FSTC reporting unit within MA. This impairment resulted from lower than expected projected growth for this reporting unit as many individuals and global financial institutions have reduced spending on training and certification services
amidst macroeconomic uncertainties in North America and EMEA.

Adjusted Operating Income was $192.4 million in 2012, including intersegment revenue and expenses, and
increased $27.2 million compared to 2011. Adjusted Operating Margin for 2012 was 22.5%, compared to 22.9% in 2011. Operating income of $130.9 million in 2012, which includes intersegment revenue and expenses, increased $3.7 million compared to 2011
and resulted in an operating margin of 15.3%, a decline of 230bps from the prior year reflecting the aforementioned increase in depreciation and amortization and goodwill impairment charge being partially offset by strong total revenue growth.

MARKET RISK

Foreign exchange risk:

Moody’s maintains a presence in 30 countries outside the U.S. In 2013, approximately 48% and 59% of the Company’s revenue and expenses, respectively, were in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally in the GBP and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 55% of Moody’s assets were located outside the U.S.
making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in FX rates. The effects of translating assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with non-U.S. functional currencies to the U.S. dollar are charged or credited to the cumulative translation
adjustment account in the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity (deficit).

The effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in
currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are charged to other non-operating income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign exchange forwards to
mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency. If foreign currencies in the Company’s foreign exchange forward portfolio were to devalue 10%
compared to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $7 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts. Additionally, if foreign currencies in the Company’s foreign exchange forward portfolio were to devalue
10% compared to the euro, there would be an approximate $4 million favorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by FX revaluation gains or losses in
future earnings on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency. Additional information on the Company’s forward contracts can be found in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10K.

Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure related to
non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Any change in the fair value of these hedges that is the result of ineffectiveness would be recognized immediately in other
non-operating (expense) income in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2013 all gains and losses on these derivatives designated as net investment hedges were recognized in OCI. If all
foreign currencies in the Company’s net investment hedge portfolio were to appreciate 10% compared to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $29 million unfavorable impact to the currency translation adjustment component of AOCI.

Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $2,106.3 million at December 31, 2013 consisted of approximately $881 million
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the euro and GBP, could reduce the reported amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments.

Credit and Interest rate risk:

The Company’s interest
rate risk management objective is to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. Moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing this
objective.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt
fluctuates based on changes in interest rates. The Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 to convert the fixed rate of interest on its $300 million Series 2005-1 Notes to a
floating interest rate based on the 3 month LIBOR. These swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying
value of the Series 2005-1 Notes, while net interest payments are recorded as interest expense/income in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. A hypothetical change of 100bps in the LIBOR-based swap rate would result in an
approximate $5 million change to the fair value of these interest rate swaps. Additional information on this interest rate swap is disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10K.

Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high-quality investment-grade securities within and outside the U.S.
with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high-grade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it
can invest with any single issuer. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit.

Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities

Year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012:

The following changes in non-cash items impacted cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012, relative to net income:

»

A $63.3 million decrease in deferred income taxes primarily due to the utilization of deferred tax assets relating to the settlement of UTPs in the first quarter of 2012;

»

a $12.2 million goodwill impairment charge in 2012 related to the FSTC reporting unit within MA;

In addition to the
non-cash items discussed above and an increase in net income of $116.2 million, the change in net cash flows provided by operating activities also reflected:

»

Payments of approximately $121 million in the first quarter of 2012, reflecting the settlement of state and local tax audits;

»

a $61.2 million increase in cash flow from changes in accounts receivable balances primarily reflecting a larger increase in accounts receivable balances in 2012 compared to 2013. The increase in 2012 reflected lower
accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2011 resulting from declines in corporate finance issuance in the fourth quarter of 2011. Approximately 26% and 23% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2013
and 2012, respectively, represents unbilled receivables which primarily reflect certain annual fees in MIS which are invoiced in arrears;

»

a $45.2 million increase in cash flows from changes in deferred revenue balances primarily reflecting overall growth in both segments;

Partially offset by:

»

an approximate $100 million decrease relating to higher incentive compensation payouts (including profit sharing and related payroll taxes) in 2013 compared to 2012 reflecting higher achievement against full-year
targeted results in 2012 compared to achievement in the prior year period;

»

an approximate $45 million decrease in cash flows relating to the timing of income tax payments primarily resulting from IRS relief due to Hurricane Sandy which allowed for the delay of fourth quarter 2012 estimated tax
payments to the first quarter of 2013;

»

a $23.1 million decrease relating to greater excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation plans primarily due to a higher intrinsic value of awards exercised in 2013 resulting from a higher Moody’s stock
price.

Y

ear ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011:

The following changes in non-cash items impacted cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011, relative to net income:

»

A $14.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense reflecting higher amortization of intangible assets due to the fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions of Copal and B&H as well as higher amortization
related to the Company’s continued investment in IT infrastructure;

»

A $25.8 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to the utilization of deferred tax assets relating to the settlement of UTPs in the first quarter of 2012;

»

A $12.8 million non-cash reduction of a liability related to the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter in 2012 compared to a $6.4 million non-cash reduction of a Legacy Tax liability in 2011;

»

$12.2 million non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge in 2012 related to the FSTC reporting unit within MA.

In
addition to the non-cash items discussed above and an increase in net income of $121.7 million, the change in net cash flows provided by operating activities also reflected:

»

Payments of approximately $121 million in the first quarter of 2012, reflecting the settlement of state and local tax audits;

»

A $145.3 million decrease in cash flow from changes in accounts receivable balances primarily reflecting higher billings in both reportable segments. The higher accounts receivable balances in the ratings segment
reflect an increase in rated issuance volumes compared to the prior year. The higher balances in MA primarily reflect the timing of billings for annual software maintenance fees. Approximately 23% and 25% of the Company’s accounts receivable
balance at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, represent unbilled receivables which primarily reflect certain annual fees in MIS which are invoiced in arrears;

Partially offset by:

»

An approximate $69 million increase in cash flows reflecting higher incentive compensation accruals compared to the prior year period resulting from greater achievement against targeted results compared to achievement
in 2011;

»

An approximate $25 million increase in cash flows reflecting higher accruals for legal defense costs which is primarily due to two matters related to SIVs rated by MIS which are more fully discussed in the
“Contingencies” section of this MD&A.

Net Cash Used In Investing Activities

Year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012:

The $211.7 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities compared to 2012 primarily reflects :

»

A $169.7 million increase in cash used to purchase short-term investments with excess non-U.S. cash;

»

cash paid, net of cash acquired, of $50.7 million relating to the acquisition of Amba in December 2013.

Year ended
December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011:

The $217.4 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities compared to 2011
primarily reflects payments in 2011, net of cash acquired, for the Copal and B&H acquisitions. The decrease also reflects lower capital additions of $22.7 million due to project timing of certain of the Company’s IT infrastructure
initiatives.

Net Cash Used In Financing Activities

Year ended
December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012:

The $701.4 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily
attributed to:

»

Treasury shares repurchased of $893.1 million in 2013 compared to $196.5 million repurchased in the prior year period;

»

Higher dividends paid to MCO shareholders of $54.3 million reflecting $0.90 per share paid in 2013 compared to $0.64 per share paid in the prior year;

Partially offset by:

»

an increase in net proceeds from stock-based compensation plans of $19.3 million reflecting higher strike prices for options exercised in 2013 compared to the prior year. These proceeds were partially offset by a
greater number of shares repurchased from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock in March 2013;

»

Higher excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation plans of $23.1 million due to due to a higher intrinsic value of awards exercised in 2013 resulting from a higher Moody’s stock price.

2013 10K


Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011:

The $620.3 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributed to:

»

A $496.1 million increase relating to proceeds received from the issuance of the 2012 Senior Notes;

»

Treasury shares repurchased of $196.5 million in 2012 compared to $333.8 million in 2011;

»

Higher net proceeds from stock-based compensation plans of $70.3 million reflecting a greater number of stock option exercises in 2012 compared to the prior year due to the Company’s higher trading price for its
common stock;

Partially offset by:

»

Higher dividends paid of $22.0 million due to an increase in the Company’s annual dividend paid per share from $0.535 cents in 2011 to $0.64 cents in 2012;

»

Repayments on the 2008 Term Loan of $71.3 million in 2012 compared to $11.3 million in 2011.

Cash held in non-U.S.
jurisdictions

The Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.1 billion at December 31, 2013 consisted of
approximately $1.2 billion located outside of the U.S., a majority of which is denominated in euros and British pounds. Over 95% of the cash and short-term investments in the Company’s non-U.S. operations are held by entities whose
undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested in the Company’s foreign operations. Accordingly, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. A future distribution or change in assertion
regarding reinvestment by the foreign subsidiaries relating to these earnings could result in additional tax liability to the Company. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the potential additional tax liability due to complexities in the
tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made. The Company manages both its U.S. and international cash flow to maintain sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs.

Future Cash Requirements

The Company believes that it has the financial
resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow for the next twelve months. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Company’s
profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources.

The Company remains committed to using its
strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by investing in growing areas of the business, reinvesting in ratings quality initiatives, making selective acquisitions in related businesses, repurchasing stock and paying a dividend, all in the
manner consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity. In December 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share of Moody’s common stock, payable on March 10, 2014 to shareholders of
record at the close of business on February 20, 2014. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board. On February 12, 2013, the Board approved an additional $1.0 billion of share
repurchase authority. At December 31, 2013, the Company had $0.8 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under this program, which does not have an established expiration. On February 11, 2014, the Board approved an additional $1.0
billion of share repurchase authority which will be utilized once the February 12, 2013 authorization is exhausted. The Company expects to complete approximately $1 billion of share repurchases in 2014. Share repurchase activity in the near
term is subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other capital allocation decisions.

As part of the Copal acquisition in November 2011, Moody’s and
the non-controlling shareholders entered into a put/call arrangement whereby the noncontrolling shareholders have the option to sell the portion of Copal that Moody’s does not currently own and Moody’s has the option to purchase this
portion from the noncontrolling shareholders. The exercise price of this option was valued at $68 million at the time of acquisition and will fluctuate based on the entity’s financial results subject to a floor exercise price of approximately
$46 million. The redemption value of this redeemable noncontrolling interest was $80.0 million at December 31, 2013. There is no limit as to the amount of the strike price on the put/call option. It is estimated that the exercise of the
put/call arrangement will take place in the next one to four years based on a Monte Carlo simulation. This put/call arrangement expires on the sixth anniversary date of the acquisition.

At December 31, 2013, Moody’s had $2.1 billion of outstanding debt, which is further described in the “Indebtedness” section of this MD&A below,
with $1.0 billion of additional capacity available under the 2012 Facility. Principal payments on the Company’s borrowings will be made in accordance with the schedule of payments outlined in the “Indebtedness” section of this
MD&A below.

On February 6, 2008, the Company entered into a 17.5 year operating lease agreement to occupy six floors of an office tower located in the
Canary Wharf district of London, England. The total base rent of the Canary Wharf Lease over its 17.5-year term is approximately £134 million, and the Company began making base rent payments in 2011. In addition to the base rent payments
the Company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for its share of operating expenses and tax obligations. The total remaining lease payments as of December 31, 2013 are approximately £109 million, of which approximately
£10 million will be paid in the next twelve months.

On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945
square-feet of an office building located at 7WTC at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which is serving as Moody’s headquarters. The 7WTC Lease has an initial term of 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base
rent of 7WTC Lease over its initial 21-year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. On March 28, 2007, the 7WTC lease
agreement was amended for the Company to lease an additional 78,568 square-feet at 7WTC. The additional base rent is approximately $106 million over a 20-year term. The total remaining lease payments as of December 31, 2013, including the
aforementioned rent credits, are approximately $479 million, of which approximately $33 million will be paid during the next twelve months.

On October 21, 2013,
the Company entered into a fourteen-year lease for three additional floors at its 7WTC headquarters. The total net commitment for this lease is approximately $74 million, including capital expenditures to build-out the space. The lease
became effective in January 2014.

During the year ending December 31, 2014, the Company anticipates making contributions of approximately $20 million to its
funded U.S. pension plan and anticipates making payments of $6.2 million related to its unfunded U.S. pension plans and $0.8 million related to its Other Retirement Plans.

On February 21, 2014, the Company made a conditional open offer to acquire up to 2,650,000 equity shares of ICRA Limited, a leading provider of credit ratings and
research in India. The offer is conditional upon acquiring at least 2,149,101 equity shares, which would increase Moody’s ownership stake from 28.5% to just over 50.0%. Full acceptance of the offer would increase Moody’s ownership stake in
ICRA to approximately 55.0%. The offer price, payable in cash, is 2,000 Indian rupees per share. The tender period is expected to begin in April 2014, subject to completion of a review of the transaction by Indian regulatory authorities. Subject to
completion of the offer and based on exchange rates in effect as of the date of the offer, the cash payment would be between $69 million and $85 million depending on the number of shares acquired.

2012 Facility

On April 18, 2012,
the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a $1 billion five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion that expires in April 2017. The 2012 Facility replaced the $1 billion 2007
Facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2012. The proceeds from the 2012 Facility will be used for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, share repurchases and acquisition financings. Interest on borrowings under the
facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium that can range from 77.5 basis points to 120 basis points per annum of the outstanding amount, depending on the Company’s Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also pays quarterly
facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the 2012 Facility. These quarterly fees can range from 10 basis points of the facility amount to 17.5 basis points, depending on the Company’s Debt/ EBITDA Ratio.

The 2012 Facility contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in
mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as set forth in the facility agreement. The 2012 Facility also contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain
a Debt to EBITDA Ratio of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the 2012
Facility, all loans outstanding under the facility (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the facility may be terminated.

Commercial Paper

On
October 3, 2007, the Company entered into a private placement commercial paper program under which the Company could issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. In October 2013, the Company terminated its CP program.

Notes Payable

On September 30, 2005, the Company issued and sold
through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2015 pursuant to the 2005 Agreement. The Series 2005-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate
of 4.98%, payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30. Proceeds from the sale of the Series 2005-1 Notes were used to refinance $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s outstanding 7.61% senior notes which
matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moody’s pays all, or part, of the Series 2005-1 Notes in advance of their maturity, such prepayment will be subject to a Make Whole Amount. The Series 2005-1 Notes are subject to certain
covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback
transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements.

On September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction,
$300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.06% Series 2007-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 pursuant to the 2007 Agreement. The Series 2007-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 6.06%, payable
semi-annually on March 7 and September 7. Under the terms of the 2007 Agreement, the Company may, from time to time within five years, in its sole discretion, issue additional series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of up
to $500.0 million pursuant to one or more supplements to the 2007 Agreement. The Company may prepay the Series 2007-1 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and a Make Whole Amount. The 2007 Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: enter into transactions with affiliates, dispose of assets, incur or create
liens, enter into any sale-leaseback transactions, or merge with any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. The Company must also not permit its Debt/EBITDA ratio to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any
fiscal quarter.

On August 19, 2010, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a public offering. The 2010 Senior
Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% and mature on September 1, 2020. Interest on the 2010 Senior Notes will be due semi-annually on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2011. The Company may prepay
the 2010 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make-Whole Amount. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the notes, the Company
may be required to purchase all or a portion of the notes upon occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event,” as defined in the 2010 Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of purchase. The 2010 Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition,
the 2010 Indenture contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company to consolidate or merge with another entity or to sell all or substantially all of its assets to another entity. The 2010 Indenture contains customary default provisions.
In addition, an event of default will occur if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fail to pay the principal of any indebtedness (as defined in the 2010 Indenture) when due at maturity in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more, or a
default occurs that results in the acceleration of the maturity of the Company’s or certain of its subsidiaries’ indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of
default under the 2010 Indenture, the notes may become immediately due and payable either automatically or by the vote of the holders of more than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the notes then outstanding.

On November 4, 2011, in connection with the acquisition of Copal, a subsidiary of the Company issued a $14.2 million non-interest bearing note to the sellers which
represented a portion of the consideration transferred to acquire the Copal entities. If a seller subsequently transfers to the Company all of its shares, the Company must repay the seller its proportion of the principal on the later of (i) the
fourth anniversary date of the note or (ii) within a time frame set forth in the acquisition agreement relating to the resolution of certain income tax uncertainties pertaining to the transaction. Otherwise, the Company must repay any amount
outstanding on the earlier of (i) two business days subsequent to the exercise of the put/call option to acquire the remaining shares of Copal of (ii) the tenth anniversary date of the issuance of the note. The Company has the right to
offset payment of the note against certain indemnification assets associated with UTPs related to the acquisition, which are more fully discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has offset the liability
for this note against the indemnification asset, thus no balance for this note is carried on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013 and 2012. In the event that the Company would not be required to settle amounts
related to the UTPs, the Company would be required to pay the sellers the principal in accordance with the note agreement. The Company may prepay the note in accordance with certain terms set forth in the acquisition agreement.

On August 20, 2012, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering. The 2012 Senior Notes bear interest at a
fixed rate of 4.50% and mature on September 1, 2022. Interest on the 2012 Senior Notes will be due

100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make-Whole Amount. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the notes, the Company may be required to purchase all or a portion of the notes upon occurrence of a
“Change of Control Triggering Event,” as defined in the 2012 Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The 2012 Indenture contains covenants that limit
the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the 2012 Indenture contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company to
consolidate or merge with another entity or to sell all or substantially all of its assets to another entity. The 2012 Indenture contains customary default provisions. In addition, an event of default will occur if the Company or certain of its
subsidiaries fail to pay the principal of any indebtedness (as defined in the 2012 Indenture) when due at maturity in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more, or a default occurs that results in the acceleration of the maturity of the
Company’s or certain of its subsidiaries’ indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the 2012 Indenture, the 2012 Senior notes may become
immediately due and payable either automatically or by the vote of the holders of more than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the notes then outstanding.

On August 12, 2013, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a public offering. The 2013 Senior Notes bear interest at
a fixed rate of 4.875% and mature on February 15, 2024. Interest on the 2013 Senior Notes will be due semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2014. The Company may prepay the 2013 Senior
Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make-Whole Amount. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Company may redeem the 2013
Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time on or after November 15, 2023 (three months prior to their maturity), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the redemption date. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the notes, the Company may be required to purchase all or a portion of the notes upon occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering
Event,” as defined in the 2013 Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The 2013 Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the 2013 Indenture contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company to consolidate or merge with another
entity or to sell all or substantially all of its assets to another entity. The 2013 Indenture contains customary default provisions. In addition, an event of default will occur if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fail to pay the principal
of any indebtedness (as defined in the 2013 Indenture) when due at maturity in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more, or a default occurs that results in the acceleration of the maturity of the Company’s or certain of its
subsidiaries’ indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the 2013 Indenture, the 2013 Senior Notes may become immediately due and payable either
automatically or by the vote of the holders of more than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the notes then outstanding.

2008 Term Loan

On May 7, 2008, Moody’s entered into a five-year, $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan with several lenders due at various times through
May 7, 2013. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay off a portion of the CP outstanding. Interest on borrowings under the 2008 Term Loan was payable quarterly at rates that were based on LIBOR plus a margin that could range from 125 basis
points to 175 basis points depending on the Company’s Debt/EBITDA ratio.

The 2008 Term Loan contained restrictive covenants that, among other things, restricted
the ability of the Company to engage or to permit its subsidiaries to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur, or permit its subsidiaries to incur, liens, in each case,
subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The 2008 Term Loan also limited the amount of debt that subsidiaries of the Company may incur. In addition, the 2008 Term Loan contained a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a
Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The 2008 Term Loan was repaid in full in May 2013.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million which will
convert the fixed rate of interest on the Series 2005-1 Notes to a floating LIBOR-based interest rate.

At December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with
all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. In addition to the covenants described above, the 2012 Facility, the 2005 Agreement, the 2007 Agreement, the 2013 Indenture, the 2012 Indenture and the 2010 Indenture contain cross default
provisions. These provisions state that default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable.
As of December 31, 2013, there are no such cross defaults.

The fair value of the long-term debt is estimated using discounted cash flows based on prevailing interest rates available
to the Company for borrowings with similar maturities.

Management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash
requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities which would result in higher financing costs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2013, Moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often
referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moody’s is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
purposes. As such, Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.

described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements

(2)

Reflects a $4.3 million contingent cash payment related to the December 10, 2013 acquisition of Amba that is dependent on the acquired entity achieving certain revenue targets for its fiscal year ended
March 31, 2014. Also, reflects a $2.4 million contingent cash payment related to the November 18, 2010 acquisition of CSI Global Education, Inc. The cash payment is dependent upon the achievement of a certain contractual milestone by
January 2016.

Reflects projected benefit payments for the next ten years relating to the Company’s U.S. unfunded Retirement Benefit Plans described in Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements

(4)

Reflects the minimum number of shares to be acquired pursuant to the Company’s open offer to acquire additional shares of ICRA Limited, which is more fully discussed in Note 24 to the consolidated financial
statements. If the Company were to acquire the maximum amount of 2.7 million shares set forth in the open offer, the total cash payment in 2014 would be approximately $85 million. The estimated commitments were calculated using exchange rates on the
day of the offer.

(5)

The table above does not include the Company’s net long-term tax liabilities of $211.0 million relating to UTP and Legacy Tax Matters, since the expected cash outflow of such amounts by period cannot be reasonably
estimated. This amount is excluded as the exact amount of the payment is still uncertain. The table above does not include the following relating to the acquisition of Copal; (i) the $14.2 million note payable as described in Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements, (ii) the $10.8 million contingent consideration obligation and the (iii) the $80.0 million Redeemable Non Controlling Interest, as the expected cash outflow of such amounts by period cannot be reasonably
estimated

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

In addition to its
reported results, Moody’s has included in this MD&A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as “non-GAAP financial measures.” Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the
Company’s reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the Company’s performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide
greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by the Company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of
other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other GAAP measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the Company. Below are brief descriptions of the
Company’s non-GAAP financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure:

Adjusted
Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin

:

The Company presents Adjusted Operating Income because management deems this metric to be a
useful measure of assessing the operating performance of Moody’s, measuring the Company’s ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand its business. Adjusted Operating Income excludes depreciation and amortization as well
as goodwill impairment charges because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring productive assets including goodwill. Companies also have different methods of depreciating and amortizing productive
assets as well as different methods of valuing goodwill. Management

Non-GAAP Diluted EPS

The Company presents this
non-GAAP measure to exclude the impact of litigation settlements, Legacy Tax Matters and restructuring items to allow for a more meaningful comparison of Moody’s diluted earnings per share from period to period. The Legacy Tax items are
specific to the Company resulting from the 2000 Distribution. The restructuring items relate to the certain costs incurred in connection with the 2007 Restructuring Plan and the 2009 Restructuring Plan. The impact of litigation settlement relates to
the settlement of two legal matters in the first quarter of 2013 which are more fully discussed in the “Contingences” section of this MD&A. Below is a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP amount:

Free Cash Flow:

The Company defines
free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions. Management believes that free cash flow is a useful metric in assessing the Company’s cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to fund
acquisitions and share repurchases. Management deems capital expenditures essential to the Company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of Moody’s operational capabilities. Accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a
recurring use of Moody’s cash flow. Below is a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow:

2014 OUTLOOK

Moody’s outlook for 2014 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business
investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, and, if actual conditions differ, Moody’s
results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.

MOODY’S

2013 10K



For Moody’s overall, the Company expects full-year 2014 revenue to grow in the high-single-digit percent range.
Full-year 2014 operating expenses are projected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Full-year 2014 operating margin is projected to be between 42 and 43 percent and adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be between 45
and 46 percent. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 33 percent due to various tax law changes. The Company expects diluted earnings per share for full-year 2014 of $3.90 to $4.00. Full-year 2014 share repurchases are expected to
be approximately $1.0 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $90 million, reflecting ongoing infrastructure maintenance, fit-out of
additional floors at 7 World Trade Center and investments in our business for efficiency and growth. The Company expects approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Growth in compliance and regulatory expense in 2014 is
projected to be less than $5 million. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $900 million.

For the global MIS business, revenue for full-year 2014 is
expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Corporate
finance revenue is projected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range. Revenue from structured finance is expected to grow in the low-single-digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit
percent range. Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range.

For MA, full-year 2014 revenue
including the recent acquisition of Amba Investment Services is expected to increase in the low-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase
in the high-teens percent range. Revenue from research, data and analytics is projected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range, while revenue for enterprise risk solutions is expected to grow in the low-teens percent range. Professional
services revenue, including Amba Investment Services, is projected to grow in the mid-forties percent range. Excluding the acquisition of Amba Investment Services, organic revenue for professional services and MA is expected to grow in the
low-double-digit and high-single-digit percent ranges, respectively.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, “Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”. The objective of
this ASU is to improve reporting by requiring entities to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in the statement of operations. The amendments in this ASU
are required to be applied prospectively and are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company has fully adopted all provisions of this ASU as of January 1, 2013, and the implementation did not have
any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements other than to provide additional footnote disclosure which in included in Note 11.

CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation that
are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities
and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

Following the global credit crisis of 2008, MIS and other credit rating agencies have been the subject of intense scrutiny, increased regulation, ongoing inquiry and
governmental investigations, and civil litigation. Legislative, regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation, regulation and enforcement actions, including with respect to MIS’s compliance with
newly imposed regulatory standards. Moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries.

In addition, the Company is facing litigation from market participants relating to the performance of MIS rated securities. Although Moody’s in the normal course
experiences such litigation, the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased following the events in the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and global credit markets more broadly over the last several years.

Two purported class action complaints were filed by purported purchasers of the Company’s securities against the Company and certain of its senior officers,
asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The first was filed by Raphael Nach in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 19, 2007. The second was filed by Teamsters Local 282 Pension Trust Fund in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 26, 2007. Both actions were consolidated into a single proceeding entitled In re Moody’s Corporation Securities Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York. On June 27, 2008, a consolidated amended complaint was filed, purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities during the period February 3, 2006 through October 24, 2007.
Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants issued false and/or misleading statements


MOODY’S

2013 10K


concerning the Company’s business conduct, business prospects, business conditions and financial results relating primarily to MIS’s ratings of structured finance products including
RMBS, CDO and constant-proportion debt obligations. The plaintiffs sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case. The Company moved for dismissal of the consolidated
amended complaint in September 2008. On February 23, 2009, the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims and sustaining others. On January 22, 2010, plaintiffs moved to certify a class of individuals who purchased Moody’s
Corporation common stock between February 3, 2006 and October 24, 2007, which the Company opposed. On March 31, 2011, the court issued an opinion denying plaintiffs’ motion to certify the proposed class. On April 14, 2011,
plaintiffs filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seeking discretionary permission to appeal the decision. The Company filed its response to the petition on April 25, 2011. On July 20, 2011, the
Second Circuit issued an order denying plaintiffs’ petition for leave to appeal. On September 14, 2012, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment, which was fully briefed on December 21, 2012. On August 23, 2013, the court
issued an opinion granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Judgment was entered in Moody’s favor on August 26, 2013. On September 23, 2013, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the judgment and from the March 2011
decision denying class certification. On December 19, 2013, that appeal was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement, thereby concluding this litigation.

On August 25, 2008, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank filed a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting
numerous common-law causes of action against two subsidiaries of the Company, another rating agency, and Morgan Stanley & Co. The action related to securities issued by a structured investment vehicle called Cheyne Finance (the
“Cheyne SIV”) and sought, among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. The central allegation against the rating agency defendants was that the credit ratings assigned to the securities issued by the Cheyne SIV were false
and misleading. In early proceedings, the court dismissed all claims against the rating agency defendants except those for fraud and aiding and abetting fraud. In June 2010, the court denied plaintiff’s motion for class certification,
and additional plaintiffs were subsequently added to the complaint. In January 2012, the rating agency defendants moved for summary judgment with respect to the fraud and aiding and abetting fraud claims. Also in January 2012, in light of
new New York state case law, the court permitted the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint that reasserted previously dismissed claims against all defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and related aiding
and abetting claims. In May 2012, the court, ruling on the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss, dismissed all of the reasserted claims except for the negligent misrepresentation claim, and on September 19, 2012, after further
proceedings, the court also dismissed the negligent misrepresentation claim. On August 17, 2012, the court ruled on the rating agencies’ motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ remaining claims for fraud and aiding and abetting
fraud. The court dismissed, in whole or in part, the fraud claims of four plaintiffs as against Moody’s but allowed the fraud claims to proceed with respect to certain claims of one of those plaintiffs and the claims of the remaining 11
plaintiffs. The court also dismissed all claims against Moody’s for aiding and abetting fraud. Three of the plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed filed motions for reconsideration, and on November 7, 2012, the court granted two of these
motions, reinstating the claims of two plaintiffs that were previously dismissed. On February 1, 2013, the court dismissed the claims of one additional plaintiff on jurisdictional grounds. Trial on the remaining fraud claims against the rating
agencies, and on claims against Morgan Stanley for aiding and abetting fraud and for negligent misrepresentation, was scheduled for May 2013. On April 24, 2013, pursuant to confidential settlement agreements, the 14 plaintiffs with claims that
had been ordered to trial stipulated to the voluntary dismissal, with prejudice, of these claims as against all defendants, and the Court so ordered that stipulation on April 26, 2013. The settlement did not cover certain claims of two
plaintiffs that were previously dismissed by the Court. On May 23, 2013, these two plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the Second Circuit, seeking reversal of the dismissal of their claims and also seeking reversal of the Court’s denial
of class certification. According to pleadings filed by plaintiffs in earlier proceedings, they seek approximately $76 million in total compensatory damages in connection with the two claims at issue on the appeal.

In October 2009, plaintiffs King County, Washington and Iowa Student Loan Liquidity Corporation each filed substantially identical putative class actions in the Southern
District of New York against two subsidiaries of the Company and several other defendants, including two other rating agencies and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG. These actions arose out of investments in securities issued by a structured
investment vehicle called Rhinebridge Plc (the “Rhinebridge SIV”) and sought, among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. Each complaint asserted a claim for common law fraud against the rating agency defendants, alleging,
among other things, that the credit ratings assigned to the securities issued by the Rhinebridge SIV were false and misleading. The case was assigned to the same judge presiding over the litigation concerning the Cheyne SIV, described above. In
April 2010, the court denied the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss. In June 2010, the court consolidated the two cases and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that, among other things, added Morgan Stanley & Co. as
a defendant. In January 2012, in light of new New York state case law, the court permitted the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint that asserted claims against the rating agency defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, negligent
misrepresentation, and aiding and abetting claims. In May 2012, the court, ruling on the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss, dismissed all of the new claims except for the negligent misrepresentation claim and a claim for aiding
and abetting fraud; on September 28, 2012, after further proceedings, the court also dismissed the negligent misrepresentation claim. Plaintiffs did not seek class certification. On September 7, 2012 the rating agencies filed a motion
for summary judgment dismissing the remaining claims against them. On January 3, 2013, the Court issued an order dismissing the claim for aiding and abet-

ting fraud against the rating agencies but allowing the claim for fraud to proceed to trial. In June 2012 and March 2013, respectively, defendants IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (and a related
entity) and Fitch, Inc. informed the court that they had executed confidential settlement agreements with the plaintiffs. On April 24, 2013, pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement, the plaintiffs stipulated to the voluntary dismissal,
with prejudice, of all remaining claims as against the remaining defendants, including Moody’s, and the Court so ordered that stipulation on April 26, 2013.

Legacy Tax Matters

Moody’s continues to have exposure to potential
liabilities arising from Legacy Tax Matters. As of December 31, 2013, Moody’s has recorded liabilities for Legacy Tax Matters totaling $17.6 million. This includes liabilities and accrued interest due to New D&B arising from the 2000
Distribution Agreement. It is possible that the ultimate liability for Legacy Tax Matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moody’s future reported
results, financial position and cash flows.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, certain Legacy Tax Matters were resolved, resulting in a $19.2 million reduction of Legacy
Tax liabilities and a $3.6 million reduction of related accrued interest expense. Similarly, in the third quarter of 2012, certain Legacy Tax Matters were resolved, resulting in a $12.8 million reduction of Legacy Tax liabilities and a $4.4 million
reduction of related accrued interest expense.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for the
Company’s business and operations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially
from those contemplated, expressed, projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Those statements appear at various places throughout this annual report on Form 10-K, including in the sections entitled “2014
Outlook” and “Contingencies” under Item 7. “MD&A”, commencing on page 28 of this annual report on Form 10-K, under “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3, of this Form 10-K, and elsewhere in the
context of statements containing the words “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “will”, “predict”, “potential”, “continue”,
“strategy”, “aspire”, “target”, “forecast”, “project”, “estimate”, “should”, “could”, “may” and similar expressions or words and variations thereof relating to
the Company’s views on future events, trends and contingencies. Stockholders and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements and other information are made as of the
date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and the Company undertakes no obligation (nor does it intend) to publicly supplement, update or revise such statements on a going-forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed
expectations or otherwise. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying examples of factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward-looking statements.

Those factors, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the
current world-wide credit market disruptions and economic slowdown, which is affecting and could continue to affect the volume of debt and other securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets; other matters that could affect the volume
of debt and other securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets, including credit quality concerns, changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; the uncertain effectiveness and possible collateral
consequences of U.S. and foreign government initiatives to respond to the current world-wide credit market disruptions and economic slowdown; concerns in the marketplace affecting our credibility or otherwise affecting market perceptions of the
integrity or utility of independent credit agency ratings; the introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressure from competitors and/or customers; the impact of regulation as an NRSRO, the potential for new
U.S., state and local legislation and regulations, including provisions in the Financial Reform Act and anticipated regulations resulting from that Act; the potential for increased competition and regulation in the EU and other foreign
jurisdictions; exposure to litigation related to our rating opinions, as well as any other litigation to which the Company may be subject from time to time; provisions in the Financial Reform Act legislation modifying the pleading standards, and EU
regulations modifying the liability standards, applicable to credit rating agencies in a manner adverse to credit rating agencies; provisions of EU regulations imposing additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services;
the possible loss of key employees; failures or malfunctions of our operations and infrastructure; any vulnerabilities to cyber threats or other cybersecurity concerns; the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Company’s
global tax planning initiatives; the outcome of those Legacy Tax Matters and legal contingencies that relate to the Company, its predecessors and their affiliated companies for which Moody’s has assumed portions of the financial responsibility;
the ability of the Company to successfully integrate acquired businesses; currency and foreign exchange volatility; and a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions. These factors, risks and uncertainties as
well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moody’s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated, expressed, projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements are described in greater detail under
“Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K, and in other filings made by the Company from time to time with the SEC or in materials incorporated herein or therein. Stockholders and investors are cautioned
that the occurrence of any of these factors, risks and uncertainties may cause the Company’s actual results

to differ materially from those contemplated, expressed, projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s
business, results of operations and financial condition. New factors may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict new factors, nor can the Company assess the potential effect of any new factors on it.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Moody’s Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the SEC in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Moody’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Moody’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company has undertaken an assessment of the design and operational effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2013 based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The COSO framework is based upon five
integrated components of control: risk assessment, control activities, control environment, information and communications and ongoing monitoring.

Based on the
assessment performed, management has concluded that Moody’s maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Moody’s Corporation:

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Moody’s Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013. We also have audited Moody’s Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Moody’s Corporation’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Moody’s Corporation as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion,
Moody’s Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992)

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

MOODY’S CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(tabular dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share data)

NOTE 1

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit, capital markets and economic research, data and analytical tools,
(iii) software solutions and related risk management services, (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, financial services training and certification services and (v) outsourced research and analytical services to institutional
customers. Moody’s has two reportable segments: MIS and MA.

MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the
entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors.

MA, which includes all of the Company’s non-rating commercial activities, develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk
management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its Research, Data and Analytics business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major
debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit-related events. The RD&A business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores. Within its Enterprise Risk Solutions
business (formerly referred to as Risk Management Software), MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. The Professional Services business provides outsourced research and analytical services along with financial
training and certification programs.

NOTE 2

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements
include those of Moody’s Corporation and its majority- and wholly-owned subsidiaries. The effects of all intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies for which the Company has significant influence over operating and
financial policies but not a controlling interest are accounted for on an equity basis whereby the Company records its proportional share of the investment’s net income or loss as part of other non-operating income (expense), net and any
dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment. The Company applies the guidelines set forth in Topic 810 of the ASC in assessing its interests in variable interest entities to decide whether to consolidate that entity. The
Company has reviewed the potential variable interest entities and determined that there are no consolidation requirements under Topic 810 of the ASC.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents principally consist of investments in money market mutual funds and high-grade commercial paper with maturities of three months
or less when purchased.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are
stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not extend the economic useful life of the related assets are charged to expense as incurred.

Research and Development Costs

All research and development costs are expensed
as incurred. These costs primarily reflect the development of credit processing software and quantitative credit risk assessment products sold by the MA segment.

Research and development costs were $22.8 million, $16.1 million, and $29.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are
included in operating expenses within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. These costs generally consist of professional services provided by third parties and compensation costs of employees.

Costs for internally developed computer software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established.
These costs primarily relate to the development or enhancement of credit processing software and quantitative credit risk assessment products sold by the MA segment, to be licensed to customers and generally consist of professional services provided
by third parties and compensation costs of employees that develop the software. Judgment is required in determining


MOODY’S

2013 10K


when technological feasibility of a product is established and the Company believes that technological feasibility for its software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have
been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to customers. Accordingly, costs for internally developed computer software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed that were eligible
for capitalization under Topic 985 of the ASC as well as the related amortization expense related to such costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

The Company
capitalizes costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use. These assets, included in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets, relate to the Company’s accounting, product delivery and other systems. Such
costs generally consist of direct costs for third-party license fees, professional services provided by third parties and employee compensation, in each case incurred either during the application development stage or in connection with upgrades and
enhancements that increase functionality. Such costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage of development as well as maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.

Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, annually as of
July 31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with ASC Topic 350.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a
three-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a determination is
made that, based on the qualitative factors, an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying
value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must perform a third step of the
impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the
identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. For the reporting units where the Company is consistently
able to conclude on impairment using only a qualitative approach, the Company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years. Goodwill is assigned to a
reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units, and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.

For purposes of assessing the recoverability of goodwill, the Company has five reporting units at December 31, 2013: one in MIS that encompasses all of Moody’s
ratings operations and four reporting units within MA: RD&A, ERS, Financial Services Training and Certifications and Copal Amba. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as
part of its ratings process, in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The ERS reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software
that is sold on a license or subscription basis as well as related advisory services for implementation and maintenance. The FSTC reporting unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other
professional development training and certification services. The Company acquired Copal and Amba in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2013, respectively. On the date of the acquisition of Amba, it was combined with the Copal reporting unit to form the
new Copal Amba reporting unit.

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable.

Rent Expense

The Company records rent
expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. In cases where there is a free rent period or future fixed rent escalations the Company will record a deferred rent liability. Additionally, the receipt of any lease incentives will be
recorded as a deferred rent liability which will be amortized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records compensation expense for all share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time
of grant. This includes shares issued under stock option and restricted stock plans. The Company has also established a pool of additional paid-in capital related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb
any recognized tax deficiencies.

2013 10K



Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Based on the Company’s risk management policy, from time to time the Company may use derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to changes in foreign
exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The changes in the
value of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are recorded currently into earnings. Changes in the derivative’s fair value that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded to other comprehensive income or loss, to the extent the hedge is
effective, and such amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. Changes in the derivative’s fair value that qualify
as net investment hedges are recorded to other comprehensive income or loss, to the extent the hedge is effective.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when
applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.

Pursuant to ASC Topic 605, when a sales arrangement contains
multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or
estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

The Company’s products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate units of
accounting under ASC Topic 605. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the
customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. In instances
where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.

The
Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the VSOE criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. In instances where the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables
in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history, the Company attempts to establish
TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining third
party pricing, possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable
pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASC Topic 605, when the Company is unable to establish selling price
using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best estimate of ESP considering internal
factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service, and customer segment
and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.

In the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or
issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, derivatives, international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed
securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities, which was approximately 30 years on a weighted average
basis at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $97 million, $82 million, and $79 million.

Multiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. Beginning January 1, 2010,
in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The Company
generally uses ESP in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings. Prior
to January 1, 2010 and pursuant to the previous accounting standards, for these types of arrangements the initial rating fee was first allocated to the monitoring service determined based on the estimated fair market value of monitoring
services, with the residual amount allocated to the initial rating. Under ASU 2009-13 this practice can no longer be used for non-software deliverables upon the adoption of ASU 2009-13.


MOODY’S

2013 10K


MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are
billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly
data. At December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, accounts receivable included approximately $21 million, $22 million, and $24 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences
between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period.

In the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from
subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from
sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the
product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from services rendered within the professional services line of business is
generally recognized as the services are performed. A large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.

Products and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element arrangement
includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the
aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.

If the arrangement
contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to determine VSOE for
all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an undelivered element, the
Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements. In cases where software implementation services are considered
essential and VSOE of fair value exists for post-contract customer support (“PCS”), once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as
implementation services are performed, while PCS is recognized over the coverage period. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for PCS, once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero
profit margin basis until essential services are complete, at which point total arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining PCS coverage period.

Accounts Receivable Allowances

Moody’s records an allowance for estimated
future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts
are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are recorded against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable
allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic
perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances.

Contingencies

From time to time, Moody’s is involved in legal and tax
proceedings, governmental investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal
course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to
SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquires not
related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as
appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In other instances,
because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes

MOODY’S

2013 10K



available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental
investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters , particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company
cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its
competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to
predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law
asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.

The
Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the Company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation, employment practices litigation and employee medical claims and terrorism, for which
the claims are not material to the Company. In addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the Company for defense costs related to professional liability claims. For matters insured by the Company’s insurance
subsidiary, Moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion. The Company determines liabilities based on an assessment of
management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates. The Cheyne SIV and Rhinebridge SIV matters more fully discussed in Note 18 are both cases from the 2008/2009 claims period, and
accordingly these matters are covered by the Company’s insurance subsidiary. Defense costs for matters not self-insured by the Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided.

For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is
more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full
knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement
with a taxing authority.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses include
costs associated with the development and production of the Company’s products and services and their delivery to customers. These expenses principally include employee compensation and benefits and travel costs that are incurred in connection
with these activities. Operating expenses are charged to income as incurred, except for certain costs related to software implementation services which are deferred until related revenue is recognized. Additionally, certain costs incurred to
develop internal use software are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses include such items as compensation and benefits for corporate officers and staff and compensation and other expenses related to sales of products. They
also include items such as office rent, business insurance, professional fees and gains and losses from sales and disposals of assets. SG&A expenses are charged to income as incurred, except for certain expenses incurred to develop internal use
software are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

The Company records its redeemable noncontrolling interest at fair value on the date of the related business combination transaction. The redeemable noncontrolling
interest represents noncontrolling shareholders’ interest in entities which are controlled but not wholly-owned by Moody’s and for which Moody’s obligation to redeem the minority shareholders’ interest is governed by a put/call
relationship. Subsequent to the initial measurement, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is recorded at the greater of its redemption value or its carrying value at the end of each reporting period. If the redeemable noncontrolling interest is
carried at its redemption value, the difference between the redemption value and the carrying value would be adjusted through capital surplus at the end of each reporting period. The Company also performs a quarterly assessment to determine if the
aforementioned redemption value exceeds the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest. If the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest were to exceed its fair value, the excess would reduce the net income attributable to
Moody’s shareholders.

Foreign Currency Translation

For all operations
outside the U.S. where the Company has designated the local currency as the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of year exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange
rates for the year. For these foreign operations, currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income represents the change in net assets of a business enterprise during a period due to transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources including foreign currency translation impacts, net actuarial losses and net prior service costs related to pension and other retirement plans and gains and losses on derivative instruments.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that
are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.

The Company classifies interest related to unrecognized
tax benefits as a component of interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties are recognized in other non-operating expenses. For UTPs, the Company first determines whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a
likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A
tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

For certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, the Company has deemed the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its
foreign operations. Accordingly, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. It is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings
were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, all of which are short-term in nature and,
accordingly, approximate fair value. Additionally, the Company invests in short-term investments that are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. Also, the Company uses derivative instruments, as further
described in Note 5, to manage certain financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. These derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company also is subject to
contingent consideration obligations related to certain of its acquisitions as more fully discussed in Note 9. These obligations are carried at their estimated fair value within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Fair value is defined by the ASC as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The determination of this fair value is based on the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company could commence transactions and considers assumptions that market participants would
use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. Also, determination of fair value assumes that market participants will consider the highest and best use of the asset.

The ASC establishes a fair value hierarchy whereby the inputs contained in valuation techniques used to measure fair value are categorized into three broad levels as
follows:

Level 1

: quoted market prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the date of the fair value measurement;

Level 2

: inputs other than quoted market prices described in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted
prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities;

Level 3

: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value measurement of the assets or liabilities.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade
receivables and derivatives.

Cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment-grade securities within and outside the U.S. The Company manages its
credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high- grade commercial paper. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.
The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short-term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. No customer accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable at December 31, 2013 or 2012.

Earnings per Share of Common Stock

Basic shares outstanding is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted shares outstanding
is calculated giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, assuming that such shares were outstanding during the reporting period.

Pension and Other
Retirement Benefits

Moody’s maintains various noncontributory DBPPs as well as other contributory and noncontributory retirement plans. The expense and
assets/liabilities that the Company reports for its pension and other retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions represent the Company’s best estimates and
may vary by plan. The differences between the assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and actual experience is spread over a five-year period to the market related value of plan assets which is used in determining the
expected return on assets component of annual pension expense. All other actuarial gains and losses are generally deferred and amortized over the estimated average future working life of active plan participants.

The Company recognizes as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheet the funded status of its defined benefit retirement plans, measured on a plan-by-plan
basis. Changes in the funded status due to actuarial gains/losses are recorded as part of other comprehensive income during the period the changes occur.

Use of
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates
are used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, income taxes, contingencies, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, goodwill, pension and other retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, and
depreciation and amortization rates for property and equipment and computer software.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, “Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”. The objective of
this ASU is to improve reporting by requiring entities to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in the statement of operations. The amendments in this ASU
are required to be applied prospectively and are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company has fully adopted all provisions of this ASU as of January 1, 2013, and the implementation did not have
any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements other than to provide additional footnote disclosure which in included in Note 11.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

Short-term investments are securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase that are available for use in the Company’s
operations in the next twelve months. The short-term investments, primarily consisting of certificates of deposit, are classified as held-to-maturity and therefore are carried at cost. The remaining contractual maturities of the short-term
investments were one to nine months and one to 11 months as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Interest and dividends are recorded into income when earned.

NOTE 5

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company is exposed to global market risks, including risks from changes in FX rates and changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the Company uses
derivatives in certain instances to manage the aforementioned financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Swaps

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company entered
into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million to convert the fixed interest rate on the Series 2005-1 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the 3-month LIBOR. The purpose of this hedge was to mitigate the risk associated
with changes in the fair value of the Series 2005-1 Notes, thus the Company has designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The fair value of the swaps is adjusted quarterly with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the Series 2005-1
Notes. The changes in the fair value of the hedges and the underlying hedged item generally offset and the net cash settlements on the swaps are recorded each period within interest income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statements
of operations.

In May 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150 million to protect against fluctuations in the
LIBOR-based variable interest rate on the 2008 Term Loan further described in Note 15. These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these swaps were recorded to other comprehensive income
or loss, to the extent that the hedge was effective, and such amounts were reclassified to earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected income. The 2008 Term Loan was repaid in full in May 2013 and the interest rate swaps
have matured. Accordingly, all amounts in AOCI have been reclassified to interest income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Foreign Exchange Forwards

The Company also enters into foreign exchange
forwards to mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under the applicable
sections of Topic 815 of the ASC. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately in other non-operating income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations along with the FX gain or
loss recognized on the assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary’s functional currency. These contracts have expiration dates at various times through March 2014.

Net Investment Hedges

The Company
enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are designated as hedging
instruments under the applicable sections of Topic 815 of the ASC. Hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the overall changes in the fair value of the forward contracts on a pre-tax basis. For hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, any
change in fair value for the hedge is recorded in OCI. Any change in the fair value of these hedges that is the result of ineffectiveness would be recognized immediately in other non-operating (expense) income in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations. These outstanding contracts expire in March 2014 for contracts to sell euros for USD and in November 2014 for contracts to sell Japanese yen for USD.

NOTE 7

ACQUISITIONS

All of the acquisitions described below were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting whereby assets acquired and liabilities assumed
were recognized at their acquisition date fair value. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded to goodwill. For all of the acquisitions described below, the Company has not
presented proforma combined results for the acquisitions because the impact on previously reported statements of operations would not have been material. Furthermore, for all acquisitions described below, the amount of revenue and expenses in
the year of acquisition from the acquisition date through the end of the year was not material. These acquisitions are discussed below in more detail.

Amba
Investment Services

On December 10, 2013, Copal Partners Limited, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired 100% of Amba Investment Services, a
provider of investment research and quantitative analytics for global financial institutions. Amba currently operates within the PS LOB of MA and will bolster the research and analytical capabilities offered by MA through Copal, a majority of which
was acquired in December 2011.

The cash payment to the sellers was funded by using Moody’s non-U.S. cash on hand.

The purchase agreement contains a provision for a contingent cash payment to the sellers valued at $4.3 million at the acquisition date. This contingent cash payment is
dependent on Amba achieving certain revenue targets for the period from the acquisition date through March 31, 2014. At December 31, 2013, financial projections for Amba indicate that it will achieve the revenue targets set forth in the
purchase agreement. Any contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of Amba will be paid to the sellers during 2014.

The Company incurred approximately $1
million of costs directly related to the acquisition of Amba during the year ended December 31, 2013. These costs, which primarily consist of consulting and legal fees, are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Copal Partners

On
November 4, 2011, subsidiaries of the Company acquired a 67% interest in Copal Partners Limited and a 100% interest in two related entities that were wholly-owned by Copal Partners Limited (together herein referred to as “Copal”).
These acquisitions resulted in the Company obtaining an approximate 75% economic ownership interest in the Copal group of companies. Copal is a provider of outsourced research and consulting services to the financial services industry. Copal
operates within the PS LOB of MA and complements the other product and services offered by MA. The table below details the total consideration transferred to the sellers of Copal:

In conjunction with the purchase, the Company and the non-controlling shareholders entered into a put/call option agreement whereby the
Company has the option to purchase from the non-controlling shareholders and the non-controlling shareholders have the option to sell to the Company the remaining 33% ownership interest of Copal Partners Limited based on a strike price to be
calculated on pre-determined formulas using a combination of revenue and EBITDA multiples when exercised. The value of the estimated put/call option strike price on the date of acquisition was based on a Monte Carlo simulation model. This model
contemplated multiple scenarios which simulated certain of Copal’s revenue, EBITDA margins and equity values to estimate the present value of the expected strike price of the option. In connection with the acquisition of Amba in December 2013,
which was combined with Copal to form the Copal Amba reporting unit, the aforementioned revenue and EBITDA multiples set forth in the original put/call option agreement were modified to include the results of Amba. The option is subject to a minimum
exercise price of $46 million. There is no limit as to the maximum amount of the strike price on the put/call option.

Additionally, as part of the consideration
transferred, the Company issued a note payable of $14.2 million to the sellers which is more fully discussed in Note 15. The Company has a right to reduce the amount payable under this note in accordance with certain indemnification arrangements
which are more fully discussed below. Accordingly, this note payable is not carried on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 in accordance with these indemnification arrangements.

Also, the purchase agreement contains several different provisions for contingent cash payments to the sellers valued at $6.8 million at the acquisition date. A portion
of the contingent cash payments are based on revenue and EBITDA growth for certain of the acquired Copal entities. This growth is calculated by comparing revenue and EBITDA in the year immediately prior to the exercise of the aforementioned put/call
option to revenue and EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2011. There are no limitations set forth in the acquisition agreement relating to the amount payable under this contingent payment arrangement. Payments under this arrangement, if any,
would be made upon the exercise of the put/call option. Other contingent cash payments, which have been fully settled as of December 31, 2013, were based on the achievement of revenue targets for 2012 and 2013, with certain limits on the amount
of revenue that can be applied to the calculation of the contingent payment. Further information on the inputs and methodologies utilized to derive the fair value of these contingent consideration liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2013
are discussed in Note 9.

The Company incurred approximately $7 million of costs directly related to the acquisition of Copal during the year ended December 31,
2011. These costs, which primarily consist of consulting and legal fees, are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

escrow agent for various uncertainties associated with the transaction of which a portion relates to these UTPs. Additionally, the Company is contractually indemnified for payments in excess of the amount paid into escrow via a reduction to the
amount payable under the aforementioned note payable issued to the sellers. Accordingly, the Company carries an indemnification asset on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013 and 2012 for which a portion has been offset by the
note payable in the amount of $14.2 million.

As of the date of this acquisition through the Amba acquisition date, Copal operated as its own reporting unit.
Accordingly, goodwill associated with the acquisition was part of the Copal reporting unit within the MA segment through December 10, 2013. On December 10, 2013, Amba was combined with the Copal reporting unit to form the new Copal Amba
reporting unit.

The 2013 additions for the MA segment relate to the acquisition of Amba in the fourth quarter of 2013. The 2012 additions/adjustments for
the MA segment relate to the acquisitions of Copal and B&H in the fourth quarter of 2011, more fully discussed in Note 7.

The impairment charge in the table
above relates to goodwill in the FSTC reporting unit within MA. The Company evaluates its goodwill for potential impairment annually on July 31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise throughout the year. Projected operating results
for the FSTC reporting unit at December 31, 2012 were lower than projections utilized for the annual impairment analysis performed at July 31, 2012 reflecting a contraction in spending for training and certification services at the time
for many individuals and global financial institutions amidst macroeconomic uncertainties in the prior year. Based on this trend and overall macroeconomic uncertainties at the time, the Company lowered its cash flow forecasts for this reporting unit
in the fourth quarter of 2012. Accordingly, the Company performed another goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2012 which resulted in an impairment charge of $12.2 million. The fair value of the FSTC reporting unit utilized in the
impairment assessment was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. There was no goodwill impairment in 2013.

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. In conjunction with the assessment of goodwill impairment at July 31, 2012, the Company reviewed the recoverability of certain customer lists within its FSTC reporting unit. This review resulted in an impairment
of approximately $1 million in the third quarter of 2012 which is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of these customer lists was determined using a discounted cash flow
analysis. The Company again reviewed the recoverability of these customer lists in the fourth quarter of 2012 in conjunction with the quantitative goodwill impairment test performed at December 31, 2012 for the FSTC reporting unit. Based on
this assessment, there was no further impairment of the customer lists in the fourth quarter of 2012. For all intangible assets, there were no such events or changes during 2013 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible
assets in any of the Company’s reporting units may not be recoverable. This determination was made based on improving market conditions for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides and an assessment of projected cash flows for all
reporting units. Additionally, there were no events or circumstances during 2013 that would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of these amortizable intangible assets.

The losses included in earnings in the table above are recorded within SG&A expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations and relate to contingent consideration obligations outstanding at December 31, 2013.

Of the $17.5 million of contingent consideration
obligations as of December 31, 2013, $4.3 million is classified in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $13.2 million is classified in other liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

The following are descriptions of the methodologies utilized by the Company to estimate the fair value of its derivative contracts and contingent consideration
obligations:

Derivatives:

In determining the fair value of the derivative
contracts in the table above, the Company utilizes industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using spot rates, forward points, currency
volatilities, interest rates as well as the risk of non-performance of the Company and the counterparties with whom it has derivative contracts. The Company established strict counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with
financial institutions that adhere to these guidelines. Accordingly, the risk of counterparty default is deemed to be minimal.

Contingent Consideration:

At December 31, 2013, the Company has contingent consideration obligations related to the acquisitions of CSI, Copal and Amba which are carried at estimated fair
value, and are based on certain financial and non-financial metrics set forth in the acquisition agreements. These obligations are measured using Level 3 inputs as defined in the ASC. The Company has recorded the obligations for these contingent
consideration arrangements on the date of each respective acquisition based on management’s best estimates of the achievement of the metrics and the value of the obligations are adjusted quarterly.

The contingent consideration obligation for CSI is based on the achievement of a certain contractual milestone by January 2016. The Company utilizes a discounted cash
flow methodology to value this obligation. The future expected cash flow for this obligation is discounted using an interest rate available to borrowers with similar credit risk profiles to that of the Company. The most significant unobservable
input involved in the measurement of this obligation is the probability that the milestone will be reached by January 2016. At December 31, 2013, the Company expects that this milestone will be reached by the aforementioned date.


MOODY’S

2013 10K


For certain of the contingent consideration obligations relating to the acquisition of Copal, a portion of the contingent
cash payments are based on revenue and EBITDA growth for certain of the Copal entities. This growth is calculated by comparing revenue and EBITDA in the year immediately prior to the exercise of the put/call option to acquire the remaining 33%
ownership interest of Copal Partners Limited which the Company does not currently own, to revenue and EBITDA in Copal’s fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. There are no limitations set forth in the acquisition agreement relating to the
amount payable under this contingent consideration arrangement. Payments under this arrangement, if any, would be made upon the exercise of the aforementioned put/call option, which expires in November 2017. Other contingent cash payments were based
on the achievement of revenue targets for Copal’s fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and 2013, with certain limits on the amount of revenue that could be applied to the calculation of these contingent payments. Each of these contingent
payments had a maximum payout of $2.5 million and have been settled as of December 31, 2013. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow methodologies to value these obligations. The expected future cash flows for the outstanding obligations are
discounted using a risk-free interest rate plus a credit spread based on the option adjusted spread of the Company’s publicly traded debt as of the valuation date. The most significant unobservable input involved in the measurement of these
obligations is the projected future financial results of the applicable Copal entities. Also, the remaining outstanding obligations are dependent upon the exercise of the call/put option and the Company has utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model to
estimate when the option will be exercised, thus triggering the payment of contingent consideration.

For the contingent consideration obligations relating to the
acquisition of Amba, the payment is based on the acquired entity achieving a revenue target for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. The Company has utilized a discounted cash flow methodology to value this obligation. Due to the short
proximity from the Company’s year end to the anticipated payment date in 2014, the expected gross payments of $4.3 million due to the sellers approximates fair value at December 31, 2013. The most significant unobservable input involved in
the measurement of this obligation is the probability that Amba will meet the aforementioned revenue target. At December 31, 2013, the Company expects that Amba will meet this revenue target and that $4.3 million in contingent consideration
payments will be made in 2014.

A significant increase or decrease in any of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs related to the fair value measurement
of the Company’s contingent consideration obligations would result in a significantly higher or lower reported fair value for these obligations.

PENSION AND OTHER RETIREMENT BENEFITS

U.S. Plans

Moody’s maintains funded and unfunded
noncontributory Defined Benefit Pension Plans. The U.S. plans provide defined benefits using a cash balance formula based on years of service and career average salary or final average pay for selected executives. The Company also provides certain
healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired U.S. employees. The retirement healthcare plans are contributory; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. Moody’s funded and unfunded U.S. pension plans, the U.S. retirement healthcare
plans and the U.S. retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the “Retirement Plans”. The U.S. retirement healthcare plans and the U.S. retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the
“Other Retirement Plans”. Effective at the Distribution Date, Moody’s assumed responsibility for the pension and other retirement benefits relating to its active employees. New D&B has assumed responsibility for the Company’s
retirees and vested terminated employees as of the Distribution Date.

Through 2007, substantially all U.S. employees were eligible to participate in the
Company’s DBPPs. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company no longer offers DBPPs to employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 and new hires instead will receive a retirement contribution in similar benefit value under the
Company’s Profit Participation Plan. Current participants of the Company’s DBPPs continue to accrue benefits based on existing plan benefit formulas.

The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the Company’s best estimate of the long-term return on plan assets and is
determined by using a building block approach, which generally weighs the underlying long-term expected rate of return for each major asset class based on their respective allocation target within the plan portfolio, net of plan paid expenses. As
the assumption reflects a long-term time horizon, the plan performance in any one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence the Company’s evaluation. For 2013, the expected rate of return used in calculating the net periodic
benefit costs was 7.30%. For 2014, the Company reduced the expected rate of return assumption to 6.80% to reflect the Company’s current view of long-term capital market outlook and is commensurate with the returns expected to be generated by
the plan assets under Company’s current investment strategy.

The assumed health cost trend rate reflects different expectations for the medical and prescribed medication components of health care
costs for pre and post-65 retirees. As the Company subsidies for retiree healthcare coverage are capped at the 2005 level, for the majority of the retirement health plan participants, retiree contributions are assumed to increase at the same rate as
the healthcare cost trend rates. In 2013, the Company revised its trend rates to reflect current expectations of future health care inflation. A one percentage-point increase or decrease in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have affected
total service and interest cost and would have a minimal impact on the retiree medical benefit obligation.

In 2012, the Company amended its retiree medical plan to
modify its current design. Effective January 1, 2013, the newly implemented plan design provides current retirees age 65 and older with the option over the next three years to either enroll in a new Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) Program
and receive a fixed amount annual subsidy or continue to stay in the current retiree medical plan. All future retirees age 65 and older will have to participate in the new HRA Program. There is no change to pre-65 coverage. As the new plan was
designed to be cost neutral to the Company, the amendment of the plan had no significant impact to the plan.

Plan Assets

Moody’s investment objective for the assets in the funded pension plan is to earn total returns that will minimize future contribution requirements over the
long-term within a prudent level of risk. The Company works with its independent investment consultants to determine asset allocation targets for its pension plan investment portfolio based on its assessment of business and financial conditions,
demographic and actuarial data, funding characteristics, and related risk factors. Other relevant factors, including historical and forward looking views of inflation and capital market returns, are also considered. Risk management practices include
monitoring of the plan, diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. The Company’s monitoring of the plan includes ongoing reviews of investment performance, annual
liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and investment portfolio reviews.

The Company’s current target asset allocation is approximately 60%
(range of 50% to 70%) in equity securities, 30% (range of 25% to 35%) in fixed income securities and 10% (range of 7% to 13% ) in other investments and the plan will use a combination of active and passive investment strategies and different
investment styles for its investment portfolios within each asset class. The plan’s equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks of small, medium and large capitalization. The plan’s fixed income investments are
diversified principally across U.S. and non-U.S. government and corporate bonds which are expected to help reduce plan exposure to

MOODY’S

interest rate variation and to better align assets with obligations. Approximately 3% of total plan assets may be invested in funds which invest in debts rated below investment grade and 3% may
be invested in emerging market debt. The plan’s other investments are made through private real estate and convertible securities funds and these investments are expected to provide additional diversification benefits and absolute return
enhancement to the plan assets. The Company does not use derivatives to leverage the portfolio. The overall allocation is expected to help protect the plan’s funded status while generating sufficiently stable returns over the long-term.

Fair value of the assets in the Company’s funded pension plan by asset category at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

Cash and cash equivalent is primarily comprised of investment in money market mutual funds. In determining fair value, Level 1
investments are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Investments in common/collective trust funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) per unit in each fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying investments owned
by each trust, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Common/collective trust funds are categorized in Level 2 to the extent that they are readily redeemable at their NAV or else they are categorized in Level 3
of the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s investment in a private real estate fund is valued using the NAV per unit of funds that are invested in real property, and the real property is valued using independent market appraisals. Since
appraisals involve utilization of significant unobservable inputs and the private real estate fund is not readily redeemable for cash, the Company’s investment in the private real estate fund is categorized in Level 3.

The table below is a summary of changes in the fair value of the Plan’s Level 3 assets:

Defined Contribution Plans

Moody’s has a
Profit Participation Plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. The Profit Participation Plan provides for an employee salary deferral and the Company matches employee contributions equal to 50% of employee contribution up to a maximum of 3% of
the employee’s pay. Moody’s also makes additional contributions to the Profit Participation Plan based on year-to-year growth in the Company’s EPS. Effective January 1, 2008, all new hires are automatically enrolled in the Profit
Participation Plan when they meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. As the Company’s U.S. DBPPs are closed to new entrants effective January 1, 2008, all eligible new hires will instead receive a retirement
contribution into the Profit Participation Plan in value similar to the pension benefits. Additionally, effective January 1, 2008, the Company implemented a deferred compensation plan in the U.S., which is unfunded and provides for employee
deferral of compensation and Company matching contributions related to compensation in excess of the IRS limitations on benefits and contributions under qualified retirement plans. Total expenses associated with U.S. defined contribution plans were
$18.8 million, $24.5 million and $14.9 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2008, Moody’s has designated the Moody’s
Stock Fund, an investment option under the Profit Participation Plan, as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and, as a result, participants in the Moody’s Stock Fund may receive dividends in cash or may reinvest such dividends into the
Moody’s Stock Fund. Moody’s paid approximately $0.5 million and $0.4 million in dividends during

the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, for the Company’s common shares held by the Moody’s Stock Fund. The Company records the dividends as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit). The Moody’s
Stock Fund held approximately 520,000 and 580,000 shares of Moody’s common stock at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

International Plans

Certain of the Company’s international operations provide pension benefits to their employees. For defined contribution plans, company contributions are
primarily determined as a percentage of employees’ eligible compensation. Moody’s also makes contributions to non-U.S. employees under a profit sharing plan which is based on year-to-year growth in the Company’s diluted EPS. Expenses
related to these defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $19.7 million, $18.8 million and $16.3 million, respectively.

For defined benefit plans, the Company maintains various unfunded DBPPs and retirement health benefit plan for certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries located in Germany,
France and Canada. These unfunded DBPPs are generally based on each eligible employee’s years of credited service and on compensation levels as specified in the plans. The DBPP in Germany was closed to new entrants in 2002. Total defined
benefit pension liabilities recorded related to non-U.S. pension plans was $7.8 million, $7.2 million and $5.3 million based on a weighted average discount rate of 3.58%, 3.53% and 4.79% at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The
pension liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2013 represent the unfunded status of these pension plans and were recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as mostly non-current liabilities. Total pension expense recorded for the years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was approximately $0.6 million for each year. These amounts are not included in the tables above. As of December 31, 2013, the amount of net actuarial losses included in AOCI related to non-U.S.
pension plans was immaterial. The Company’s non-U.S. other retirement benefit obligation was also immaterial as of December 31, 2013.

NOTE 13

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

Under the 1998 Plan, 33.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance. The 2001 Plan, which is shareholder
approved, permits the granting of up to 50.6 million shares, of which not more than 14.0 million shares are available for grants of awards other than stock options. The Stock Plans also provide for the granting of restricted stock. The
Stock Plans provide that options are exercisable not later than ten years from the grant date. The vesting period for awards under the Stock Plans is generally determined by the Board at the date of the grant and has been four years except for
employees who are at or near retirement eligi-

bility, as defined, for which vesting is between one and four years. Additionally, the vesting period is three years for certain performance-based restricted stock that contain a condition
whereby the number of shares that ultimately vest are based on the achievement of certain non-market based performance metrics of the Company. Options may not be granted at less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the
date of grant.

The Company maintains the Directors’ Plan for its Board, which permits the granting of awards in the form of non-qualified stock options,
restricted stock or performance shares. The Directors’ Plan provides that options are exercisable not later than ten years from the grant date. The vesting period is determined by the Board at the date of the grant and is generally one year for
both options and restricted stock. Under the Directors’ Plan, 1.7 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. Any director of the Company who is not an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the date that
an award is granted is eligible to participate in the Directors’ Plan.

The fair value of each employee stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that
uses the assumptions noted below. The expected dividend yield is derived from the annual dividend rate on the date of grant. The expected stock volatility is based on an assessment of historical weekly stock prices of the Company as well as implied
volatility from Moody’s traded options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. government zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to the expected holding period. The expected holding period was determined by examining historical and
projected post-vesting exercise behavior activity.

In the year ended December 2013, the fair value of the delivered shares for the performance-based restricted stock plan was $25.5 million for which the tax benefit
realized was $9.7 million. These delivered shares vested in December 2012.

As of December 31, 2013, there was $13.6 million of total unrecognized
compensation expense related to this plan. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.9 years.

The Company has a policy of issuing
treasury stock to satisfy shares issued under stock-based compensation plans.

In addition, the Company also sponsors the ESPP. Under the ESPP, 6.0 million
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase common stock of the Company on a monthly basis at a discount to the average of the high and the low trading prices on the New York Stock Exchange on
the last trading day of each month. This discount was 5% in 2013, 2012

and 2011 resulting in the ESPP qualifying for non-compensatory status under Topic 718 of the ASC. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for the ESPP in 2013, 2012, and 2011. The
employee purchases are funded through after-tax payroll deductions, which plan participants can elect from one percent to ten percent of compensation, subject to the annual federal limit.

Amounts are primarily set to expire beginning in 2017, if unused.

As of December 31, 2013, the Company had
approximately $1,574.6 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that it intends to indefinitely reinvest in foreign operations. The Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. It is
not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future, due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

The Company had valuation allowances of $8.4 million and $15.2 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to foreign net operating
losses for which realization is uncertain. The decrease in the valuation allowances for 2013 primarily resulted from the expected utilization of losses in certain jurisdictions based on the Company’s evaluation of these future benefits.

As of December 31, 2013 the Company had $195.6 million of UTPs of which $136.3 million represents the amount
that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods.

The Company classifies interest related to UTPs in interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties, if incurred,
would be recognized in other non-operating expenses. During 2013, the Company incurred a net interest expense of $7.6 million related to UTPs. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the amount of accrued interest recorded in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets related to UTPs was $17.9 million and $10.6 million, respectively.

Moody’s Corporation and subsidiaries are subject to
U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2008 through 2010 are under examination and its 2011 and 2012 returns remain open to
examination. The Company’s New York State income tax returns for 2011 and 2012 remain open to examination. The Company’s New York City income tax returns have been examined through 2012. Tax filings in the U.K. remain open to examination
for tax years 2008 through 2012.

For current ongoing audits related to open tax years, the Company estimates that it is possible that the balance of UTPs could
decrease in the next twelve months as a result of the effective settlement of these audits, which might involve the payment of additional taxes, the adjustment of certain deferred taxes and/or the recognition of tax benefits. It is also possible
that new issues might be raised by tax authorities which might necessitate increases to the balance of UTPs. As the Company is unable to predict the timing of conclusion of these audits, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of changes to the
balance of UTPs at this time.

2012 Facility

On
April 18, 2012, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a $1 billion five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion that expires in April 2017. The 2012 Facility replaced
the $1 billion 2007 Facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2012. The proceeds from the 2012 Facility will be used for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, share repurchases and acquisition financings. Interest on
borrowings under the facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium that can range from 77.5 basis points to 120 basis points per annum of the outstanding amount, depending on the Company’s Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company
also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the 2012 Facility. These quarterly fees can range from 10 basis points of the facility amount to 17.5 basis points, depending on the Company’s Debt/ EBITDA Ratio.

The 2012 Facility contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in
mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as set forth in the facility agreement. The 2012 Facility also contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain
a Debt to EBITDA Ratio of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the 2012
Facility, all loans outstanding under the facility (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the facility may be terminated.

Commercial Paper

On October 3, 2007, the Company entered into a
private placement commercial paper program under which the Company could issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. In October 2013, the Company terminated its CP program.

Notes Payable

On September 30, 2005, the Company issued and sold
through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2015 pursuant to the 2005 Agreement. The Series 2005-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate
of 4.98%, payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30. Proceeds from the sale of the Series 2005-1 Notes were used to refinance $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s outstanding 7.61% senior notes which
matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moody’s pays all, or part, of the Series 2005-1 Notes in advance of their maturity, such prepayment will be subject to a Make Whole Amount. The Series 2005-1 Notes are subject to certain
covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback
transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements.

On September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction,
$300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.06% Series 2007-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 pursuant to the 2007 Agreement. The Series 2007-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 6.06%, payable
semi-annually on March 7 and September 7. Under the terms of the 2007 Agreement, the Company may, from time to time within five years, in its sole discretion, issue additional series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of up
to $500.0 million pursuant to one or more supplements to the 2007 Agreement. The Company may prepay the Series 2007-1 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and a Make Whole Amount. The 2007 Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: enter into transactions with affiliates, dispose of assets, incur or create
liens, enter into any sale-leaseback transactions, or merge with any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. The Company must also not permit its Debt/EBITDA ratio to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any
fiscal quarter.

On August 19, 2010, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a public offering. The 2010 Senior
Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% and mature on September 1, 2020. Interest on the 2010 Senior Notes will be due semi-annually on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2011. The Company may prepay
the 2010 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make-Whole Amount. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the notes, the Company
may be required to purchase all or a portion of the notes upon occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event,” as defined in the 2010 Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of purchase. The 2010 Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition,
the 2010 Indenture contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company to consolidate or merge with another entity or to sell all or substantially all of its assets to another entity. The 2010 Indenture contains customary default provisions.
In addition, an event of default will occur if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fail to pay the principal of any indebtedness (as defined in the 2010 Indenture) when due at maturity in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more, or a
default occurs that results in the acceleration of the maturity of the Company’s or certain of its subsidiaries’ indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of
default under the 2010

Indenture, the notes may become immediately due and payable either automatically or by the vote of the holders of more than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the notes then
outstanding.

On November 4, 2011, in connection with the acquisition of Copal, a subsidiary of the Company issued a $14.2 million non-interest bearing note to
the sellers which represented a portion of the consideration transferred to acquire the Copal entities. If a seller subsequently transfers to the Company all of its shares, the Company must repay the seller its proportion of the principal on the
later of (i) the fourth anniversary date of the note or (ii) within a time frame set forth in the acquisition agreement relating to the resolution of certain income tax uncertainties pertaining to the transaction. Otherwise, the Company
must repay any amount outstanding on the earlier of (i) two business days subsequent to the exercise of the put/call option to acquire the remaining shares of Copal of (ii) the tenth anniversary date of the issuance of the note. The
Company has the right to offset payment of the note against certain indemnification assets associated with UTPs related to the acquisition, which are more fully discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company
has offset the liability for this note against the indemnification asset, thus no balance for this note is carried on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013 and 2012. In the event that the Company would not be
required to settle amounts related to the UTPs, the Company would be required to pay the sellers the principal in accordance with the note agreement. The Company may prepay the note in accordance with certain terms set forth in the acquisition
agreement.

On August 20, 2012, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering. The 2012 Senior Notes bear
interest at a fixed rate of 4.50% and mature on September 1, 2022. Interest on the 2012 Senior Notes will be due semi-annually on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2013. The Company may prepay the 2012
Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make-Whole Amount. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the notes, the Company may be
required to purchase all or a portion of the notes upon occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event,” as defined in the 2012 Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of purchase. The 2012 Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the 2012
Indenture contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company to consolidate or merge with another entity or to sell all or substantially all of its assets to another entity. The 2012 Indenture contains customary default provisions. In
addition, an event of default will occur if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fail to pay the principal of any indebtedness (as defined in the 2012 Indenture) when due at maturity in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more, or a default
occurs that results in the acceleration of the maturity of the Company’s or certain of its subsidiaries’ indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default
under the 2012 Indenture, the 2012 Senior notes may become immediately due and payable either automatically or by the vote of the holders of more than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the notes then outstanding.

On August 12, 2013, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a public offering. The 2013 Senior Notes bear interest at
a fixed rate of 4.875% and mature on February 15, 2024. Interest on the 2013 Senior Notes will be due semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2014. The Company may prepay the 2013 Senior
Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make-Whole Amount. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Company may redeem the 2013
Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time on or after November 15, 2023 (three months prior to their maturity), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the redemption date. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the notes, the Company may be required to purchase all or a portion of the notes upon occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering
Event,” as defined in the 2013 Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The 2013 Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the 2013 Indenture contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company to consolidate or merge with another

2008 Term Loan

On May 7, 2008, Moody’s entered into a five-year, $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan with several lenders due at various times through
May 7, 2013. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay off a portion of the CP outstanding. Interest on borrowings under the

2013 10K



2008 Term Loan was payable quarterly at rates that were based on LIBOR plus a margin that could range from 125 basis points to 175 basis points depending on the Company’s Debt/EBITDA ratio.

The 2008 Term Loan contained restrictive covenants that, among other things, restricted the ability of the Company to engage or to permit its subsidiaries to engage
in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur, or permit its subsidiaries to incur, liens, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The 2008 Term Loan also
limited the amount of debt that subsidiaries of the Company may incur. In addition, the 2008 Term Loan contained a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal
quarter. The 2008 Term Loan was repaid in full in May 2013.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million which will
convert the fixed rate of interest on the Series 2005-1 Notes to a floating LIBOR-based interest rate.

At December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with
all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. In addition to the covenants described above, the 2012 Facility, the 2005 Agreement, the 2007 Agreement, the 2013 Indenture, the 2012 Indenture and the 2010 Indenture contain cross default
provisions. These provisions state that default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable.
As of December 31, 2013, there are no such cross defaults.

NOTE 16

CAPITAL STOCK

Authorized Capital Stock

The total number of shares of all
classes of stock that the Company has authority to issue under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation is 1.02 billion shares with a par value of $0.01, of which 1.0 billion are shares of common stock, 10.0 million are shares of preferred
stock and 10.0 million are shares of series common stock. The preferred stock and series common stock can be issued with varying terms, as determined by the Board.

Share Repurchase Program

The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase
program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5-1 program. Moody’s may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant. On July 30, 2007, the Board of the Company authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase
program, which the Company began utilizing in January 2008. The company completed this program in the third quarter of 2013. On February 12, 2013, the Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. On February 11, 2014, the
Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program which will commence following the completion of the existing program. There is no established expiration date for both the February 12, 2013 and February 11, 2014 authorizations. The
Company’s intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves their long-term interests. As a result, Moody’s share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter.

During 2013, Moody’s repurchased 14.2 million shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program and issued 5.5 million shares under employee
stock-based compensation plans.

three floors at its 7WTC headquarters which became effective on January 2, 2014. The total net commitment for the additional three floors is approximately $74 million, including capital expenditures to build-out the space. The total base rent
for the entire lease term, including rent credits, for the 7WTC lease and the additional floors is approximately $703 million. As of December 31, 2013, the company has a remaining obligation of $539.9 million.

On February 6, 2008, the Company entered into a 17.5 year operating lease agreement to occupy six floors of an office tower located in the Canary Wharf district of
London, England. The total base rent of the Canary Wharf Lease over its 17.5-year term is approximately 134 million GBP, and the Company began making base rent payments in 2011. As of December 31, 2013, the Company has a remaining
obligation of $181.4 million. In addition to the base rent payments the Company is obligated to pay certain customary amounts for its share of operating expenses and tax obligation.

CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation that are
incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and
contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

Following the global credit crisis of 2008, MIS and other credit rating agencies have been the subject of intense scrutiny, increased regulation, ongoing inquiry and
governmental investigations, and civil litigation. Legislative, regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation, regulation and enforcement actions, including with respect to MIS’s compliance with
newly imposed regulatory standards. Moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries.

In addition, the Company is facing litigation from market participants relating to the performance of MIS rated securities. Although Moody’s in the normal course
experiences such litigation, the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased following the events in the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and global credit markets more broadly over the last several years.

Two purported class action complaints were filed by purported purchasers of the Company’s securities against the Company and certain of its senior officers,
asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The first was filed by Raphael Nach in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 19, 2007. The second was filed by Teamsters Local 282 Pension Trust Fund in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 26, 2007. Both actions were consolidated into a single proceeding entitled In re Moody’s Corporation Securities Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York. On

June 27, 2008, a consolidated amended complaint was filed, purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities during the period February 3, 2006 through
October 24, 2007. Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants issued false and/or misleading statements concerning the Company’s business conduct, business prospects, business conditions and financial results relating primarily to MIS’s
ratings of structured finance products including RMBS, CDO and constant-proportion debt obligations. The plaintiffs sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case.
The Company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in September 2008. On February 23, 2009, the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims and sustaining others. On January 22, 2010, plaintiffs moved to certify a
class of individuals who purchased Moody’s Corporation common stock between February 3, 2006 and October 24, 2007, which the Company opposed. On March 31, 2011, the court issued an opinion denying plaintiffs’ motion to
certify the proposed class. On April 14, 2011, plaintiffs filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seeking discretionary permission to appeal the decision. The Company filed its response to the petition on
April 25, 2011. On July 20, 2011, the Second Circuit issued an order denying plaintiffs’ petition for leave to appeal. On September 14, 2012, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment, which was fully briefed on
December 21, 2012. On August 23, 2013, the court issued an opinion granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Judgment was entered in Moody’s favor on August 26, 2013. On September 23, 2013, plaintiffs filed a
notice of appeal from the judgment and from the March 2011 decision denying class certification. On December 19, 2013, that appeal was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement, thereby concluding this
litigation.

On August 25, 2008, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank filed a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York asserting numerous common-law causes of action against two subsidiaries of the Company, another rating agency, and Morgan Stanley & Co. The action related to securities issued by a structured investment vehicle called Cheyne
Finance (the “Cheyne SIV”) and sought, among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. The central allegation against the rating agency defendants was that the credit ratings assigned to the securities issued by the Cheyne SIV
were false and misleading. In early proceedings, the court dismissed all claims against the rating agency defendants except those for fraud and aiding and abetting fraud. In June 2010, the court denied plaintiff’s motion for class
certification, and additional plaintiffs were subsequently added to the complaint. In January 2012, the rating agency defendants moved for summary judgment with respect to the fraud and aiding and abetting fraud claims. Also in January
2012, in light of new New York state case law, the court permitted the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint that reasserted previously dismissed claims against all defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, negligent misrepresentation,
and related aiding and abetting claims. In May 2012, the court, ruling on the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss, dismissed all of the reasserted claims except for the negligent misrepresentation claim, and on September 19,
2012, after further proceedings, the court also dismissed the negligent misrepresentation claim. On August 17, 2012, the court ruled on the rating agencies’ motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ remaining claims for fraud and
aiding and abetting fraud. The court dismissed, in whole or in part, the fraud claims of four plaintiffs as against Moody’s but allowed the fraud claims to proceed with respect to certain claims of one of those plaintiffs and the claims of the
remaining 11 plaintiffs. The court also dismissed all claims against Moody’s for aiding and abetting fraud. Three of the plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed filed motions for reconsideration, and on November 7, 2012, the court granted
two of these motions, reinstating the claims of two plaintiffs that were previously dismissed. On February 1, 2013, the court dismissed the claims of one additional plaintiff on jurisdictional grounds. Trial on the remaining fraud claims
against the rating agencies, and on claims against Morgan Stanley for aiding and abetting fraud and for negligent misrepresentation, was scheduled for May 2013. On April 24, 2013, pursuant to confidential settlement agreements, the 14
plaintiffs with claims that had been ordered to trial stipulated to the voluntary dismissal, with prejudice, of these claims as against all defendants, and the Court so ordered that stipulation on April 26, 2013. The settlement did not cover
certain claims of two plaintiffs that were previously dismissed by the Court. On May 23, 2013, these two plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the Second Circuit, seeking reversal of the dismissal of their claims and also seeking reversal of
the Court’s denial of class certification. According to pleadings filed by plaintiffs in earlier proceedings, they seek approximately $76 million in total compensatory damages in connection with the two claims at issue on the appeal.

In October 2009, plaintiffs King County, Washington and Iowa Student Loan Liquidity Corporation each filed substantially identical putative class actions in the Southern
District of New York against two subsidiaries of the Company and several other defendants, including two other rating agencies and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG. These actions arose out of investments in securities issued by a structured
investment vehicle called Rhinebridge Plc (the “Rhinebridge SIV”) and sought, among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. Each complaint asserted a claim for common law fraud against the rating agency defendants, alleging,
among other things, that the credit ratings assigned to the securities issued by the Rhinebridge SIV were false and misleading. The case was assigned to the same judge presiding over the litigation concerning the Cheyne SIV, described above. In
April 2010, the court denied the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss. In June 2010, the court consolidated the two cases and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that, among other things, added Morgan Stanley & Co. as
a defendant. In January 2012, in light of new New York state case law, the court permitted the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint that asserted claims against the rating agency defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, negligent
misrepresentation, and aiding and abetting claims. In May 2012, the court, ruling on the rating agency defendants’ motion to dismiss, dismissed all of the new claims except for the negligent misrepresentation claim and a claim for aiding
and abetting fraud; on September 28, 2012, after further proceedings, the court also dismissed the negligent misrepresentation

claim. Plaintiffs did not seek class certification. On September 7, 2012 the rating agencies filed a motion for summary judgment dismissing the remaining claims against them. On
January 3, 2013, the Court issued an order dismissing the claim for aiding and abetting fraud against the rating agencies but allowing the claim for fraud to proceed to trial. In June 2012 and March 2013, respectively, defendants IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG (and a related entity) and Fitch, Inc. informed the court that they had executed confidential settlement agreements with the plaintiffs. On April 24, 2013, pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement, the plaintiffs
stipulated to the voluntary dismissal, with prejudice, of all remaining claims as against the remaining defendants, including Moody’s, and the Court so ordered that stipulation on April 26, 2013.

Legacy Tax Matters

Moody’s continues to have exposure to potential
liabilities arising from Legacy Tax Matters. As of December 31, 2013, Moody’s has recorded liabilities for Legacy Tax Matters totaling $17.6 million. This includes liabilities and accrued interest due to New D&B arising from the 2000
Distribution Agreement. It is possible that the ultimate liability for Legacy Tax Matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moody’s future reported
results, financial position and cash flows.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, certain Legacy Tax Matters were resolved, resulting in a $19.2 million reduction of Legacy
Tax liabilities and a $3.6 million reduction of related accrued interest expense. Similarly, in the third quarter of 2012, certain Legacy Tax Matters were resolved, resulting in a $12.8 million reduction of Legacy Tax liabilities and a $4.4 million
reduction of related accrued interest expense.

NOTE 19

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company is organized into three operating segments: (i) MIS, (ii) MA and (iii) an immaterial operating segment that provides fixed
income pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region. This aforementioned immaterial operating segment has been aggregated with the MA operating segment based on the fact that it has similar economic characteristics to MA. Accordingly, the Company
reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA. The MIS segment is comprised of all of the Company’s ratings activities. All of Moody’s other non-rating commercial activities are included in the MA segment.

The MIS segment consists of four lines of business – corporate finance, structured finance, financial institutions and public, project and infrastructure finance
– that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide.

The MA segment, which includes all of the Company’s non-rating commercial activities, develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management
activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. The MA segment consists of three lines of business – RD&A, ERS and PS.

In the first
quarter of 2013, a portion of a division within the PS LOB that provides solutions for structured finance securities was transferred to the RD&A LOB. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2012, a division within the PS LOB that provides
various financial modeling services was transferred to the ERS LOB. Accordingly, the prior year revenue by LOB for MA has been reclassified to reflect these transfers.

Revenue for MIS and expenses for MA include an intersegment royalty charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. The
royalty rate charged by MIS approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content, data and products and is generally based on comparable market transactions. Also, revenue for MA and expenses for MIS include an intersegment fee charged to MIS
from MA for certain MA products and services utilized in MIS’s ratings process. These fees charged by MA are generally equal to the costs incurred by MA to produce these products and services. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses
of the Company which exclusively benefit only one segment, are fully charged to that segment. Overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company which benefit both segments are allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology.
Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resources and information technology. Beginning on January 1, 2013, the Company refined its methodology for allocating
certain overhead departments to its segments to better align the costs allocated based on each segment’s usage of the overhead service. The refined methodology is reflected in the segment results for the year ended December 31, 2013 and
accordingly, the segment results for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. These reclassifications were not material. “Eliminations” in the table below represent
intersegment revenue/expense.

Moody’s does not report the Company’s assets by reportable segment as this metric is not used by the chief operating decision
maker to allocate resources to the segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by reportable segment.

In January 2014, the Company revised its operating segments to create the new Copal Amba operating segment. The new operating
segment will consist of all operations from Copal, a majority of which was acquired in December 2011, and the operations of Amba. The Copal Amba operating segment provides offshore research and analytic services to the global financial and
corporate sectors. The Company is currently in the process of determining whether the new Copal Amba segment has similar economic characteristics to MA as defined in ASC 280, and whether it will be combined with the MA segment into one
reportable segment beginning in 2014.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On February 21, 2014, the Company made a conditional open offer to acquire up to 2,650,000 equity shares of ICRA Limited, a leading provider of
credit ratings and research in India. The offer is conditional upon acquiring at least 2,149,101 equity shares, which would increase Moody’s ownership stake from 28.5% to just over 50.0%. Full acceptance of the offer would increase Moody’s
ownership stake in ICRA to approximately 55.0%. Upon the closing of the offer, the Company anticipates that it would consolidate the results of ICRA Limited into its financial statements subsequent to the acquisition of the shares.

The offer price, payable in cash, is 2,000 Indian rupees per share which, based on exchange rates on the date of the offer, would result in a cash payment to the
sellers ranging between approximately $69 million and $85 million depending on the number of shares acquired. The tender period is expected to begin in April 2014, subject to completion of a review of the transaction by Indian regulatory
authorities.
