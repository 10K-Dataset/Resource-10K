(i) credit ratings; (ii) credit, capital markets and economic research, data and analytical tools; (iii) software solutions that support financial risk management activities; (iv) quantitatively derived credit scores; (v)
financial services training and certification services; (vi) offshore financial research and analytical services; and (vii) company information and business intelligence products. Moody’s reports in two reportable segments: MIS and
MA. Financial information and operating results of these segments, including revenue, expenses and operating income, are included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements of this annual report, and are herein incorporated by reference.

MIS publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate and
governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. Ratings revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to
investors. MIS provides ratings in more than 120 countries. Ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media, including the Internet and real-time information systems widely used by securities
traders and investors. As of December 31, 2017, MIS had the following ratings relationships:

»

Approximately 4,700 rated

non-financial

corporate issuers;

»

Approximately 4,100 rated financial institutions issuers;

»

Approximately 18,000 rated public finance issuers (including sovereign,

sub-sovereign

and supranational issuers);

»

Approximately 11,000 rated structured finance transactions; and

»

Approximately 1,000 rated infrastructure and project finance issuers.

Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain

non-ratings-related

operations, which primarily consist of financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA

non-rating

operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.

The MA segment develops a wide
range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its Research, Data and Analytics business, MA distributes research and data developed by
MIS as part of its ratings process, including

in-depth

research on major debt issuers, industry studies, commentary on topical credit related events. The RD&A LOB also provides economic research and credit
data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores as well as business intelligence and company information products. Within its Enterprise Risk Solutions business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management
services. Within its Professional Services business it provides offshore research and analytical services along with financial training and certification programs. MA customers represent more than 10,500 institutions worldwide operating in over 155
countries. During 2017 Moody’s research website was accessed by over 252,000 individuals including 36,000 customer users.

PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH

Over recent decades, global
fixed-income markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and types of securities or other obligations outstanding. Beginning in

mid-2007,

there was a severe market disruption and associated
financial crisis both in the devel-

MOODY’S

oped and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in debt issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak economic performance in advanced economies. Since this financial
crisis, many markets and economies have recovered and Moody’s believes the overall long-term outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixed-income market and related financial information market, which includes information
such as credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services.

Moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact
financial information markets including:

»

Health of the world’s major economies;

»

Debt capital markets activity;

»

Disintermediation of credit markets;

»

Fiscal and monetary policy of governments; and

»

Business investment spending, including mergers and acquisitions.

In an environment of increasing financial complexity
and heightened attention to credit analysis and risk management, Moody’s is well positioned to benefit from continued growth in global fixed-income market activity and a more widespread use of credit ratings, research and related analytical
products. Moody’s expects that these developments will support continued long-term demand for high quality, independent credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services.

Strong secular trends should continue to provide long-term growth opportunities. For MIS, key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global GDP growth,
continued disintermediation of fixed-income markets in both developed and emerging economies driving issuance and demand for new ratings products and services. Growth in MA is likely to be driven by deeper and broader penetration of its customer
base as regulatory compliance and other analytical requirements drive demand for MA’s products and expertise. Moreover, pricing opportunities aligned with customer value creation and advances in information technology present growth
opportunities for Moody’s.

Growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including
interest rates, business investment spending, corporate refinancing needs, merger and acquisition activity, issuer profits, consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity. Rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of
MIS. Therefore, a substantial portion of MIS’s revenue is dependent upon the dollar-equivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets. MIS’s results can be affected by factors such as the
performance and prospects for growth of the major world economies, the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments, and the decisions of issuers to request MIS ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions. However, annual fee
arrangements with frequent debt issuers, annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and medium-term note programs, bank deposit ratings, insurance company financial strength ratings, mutual fund ratings, and other areas
partially mitigate MIS’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixed-income markets. Furthermore, the strong growth seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the

mid-1990’s

reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil, with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010, before stabilizing in 2011 with Moody’s experiencing revenue growth in this market beginning
in 2012. Despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels, Moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixed-income markets and provide opportunities for long-term revenue growth.

The pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and
facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and similarly investors’ ability to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets. Technology also allows issuers and investors the
ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell, which in the absence of the appropriate technology might not be readily or easily obtainable. This
availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide, giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of both established and newer capital markets. As technology provides broader access to
worldwide markets, it also results in a greater need for credible, globally comparable opinions about credit risk, data, analytics and related services. Additionally, information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global
platform to support Moody’s continued expansion in developing markets.

An ongoing trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation of
financial systems. Issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets, in addition to, or in substitution for, traditional financial intermediaries. Moreover, financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public
capital markets, in addition to, or instead of, retaining those assets. Moody’s believes that issuer use of global debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to traditional banking systems and that the trend of
increased disintermediation will continue. Further, disintermediation has continued because of the ongoing low interest rate environment and bank deleveraging, which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative
funding in the bond markets.


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


Moody’s also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking
system capacity. Thus, disintermediation is expected to continue over the longer-term, with Moody’s targeting investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust.

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, banking, insurance and capital markets authorities promulgated a wide range of new regulations to restore stability and
confidence in financial institutions under their oversight. Programs such as Basel III, Solvency II, and CCAR — among many others — prompted banks, insurers, securities dealers, and asset managers to invest in more robust risk management
practices and systems. Many of these investments drew on expertise and tools offered by MA, resulting in strong revenue growth in the post-crisis period. As banking and capital markets continue to stabilize, and with financial institutions better
capitalized, regulatory-driven demand for MA products will moderate. Nonetheless, we expect that MA products and services that enable compliance with financial regulation will continue to be adopted by institutions worldwide, prompted by periodic
revisions to regulatory frameworks such as the Basel capital adequacy protocols. Moreover, having responded to regulatory imperatives, financial institutions are increasingly seeking to leverage investments in regulatory compliance systems to gain
business insights and front-office efficiencies; MA is well-positioned to realize revenue growth by assisting in these efforts to apply back-office analytics in support of front-line business decisions. Finally, in order to respond to other sources
of demand and drive growth, MA is actively investing in new products, including enhanced data sets and improved delivery methods (e.g., software-as-a-service). These efforts will support broader distribution of MA’s capabilities, deepen
relationships with existing customers and facilitate more new customer acquisition.

Legislative bodies and regulators in the U.S., Europe and other jurisdictions
continue to conduct regulatory reviews of CRAs, which may result in, for example, an increased number of competitors, changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of MIS, removal of references to ratings in certain
regulations, or increased costs of doing business for MIS. Therefore, in order to broaden the potential for expansion of

non-ratings

services, Moody’s reorganized in January 2008 into two distinct
businesses: MIS, consisting primarily of the ratings business, and MA, which conducts activities including the sale of credit research produced by MIS and the production and sale of other economic and credit-related products and services. The
reorganization broadened the opportunities for expansion by MA into activities that may have otherwise been restricted for MIS, due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business. At present, Moody’s is unable to assess
the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities.

Moody’s operations are subject to various risks, as more fully
described in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” inherent in conducting business on a global basis. Such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization, expropriation, exchange and price controls, changes in the
availability of data from public sector sources, limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions.

COMPETITION

MIS competes with other CRAs and with
investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research. Many users of MIS’s ratings also have

in-house

credit research capabilities. MIS’s largest competitor in the global
credit rating business is S&P Global Ratings (S&P), a division of S&P Global. There are some rating markets, based on industry, geography and/or instrument type, in which Moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions
superior to S&P, while in other markets, the reverse is true.

In addition to S&P, MIS’s competitors include Fitch Ratings, Dominion Bond Rating Service
(DBRS), A.M. Best Company, Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd., Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc., Morningstar Inc. and Egan-Jones Ratings Company. In Europe, there are approximately 30 companies currently registered with ESMA, which include both purely
domestic European CRAs and International CRAs such as S&P, Fitch and DBRS. There are additional competitors in other regions and countries, for example, in China, where Moody’s participates through a joint venture. These competitors include
China Lianhe Credit Rating Co Ltd., Shanghai Brilliance Credit Rating & Investors Service Co Ltd., Dagong Global Credit Rating Co Ltd. and Pengyuan Credit Rating Co Ltd.

MA competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified competitors such as Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg, S&P Global Market Intelligence, Fitch
Solutions, Dun & Bradstreet, IBM, Wolters Kluwer, Fidelity National Information Services, SAS, Fiserv, MSCI and IHS Markit among others. MA’s main competitors within RD&A include S&P Global Market Intelligence, CreditSights,
Thomson Reuters, Intex, IHS Markit, BlackRock Solutions, FactSet and other providers of fixed income analytics, valuations, economic data and research. In ERS, MA faces competition from both large software providers such as IBM Algorithmics,
Fidelity National Information Services, SAS, Oracle, Misys, Oliver Wyman, Verisk Analytics and various other vendors and

in-house

solutions. Within Professional Services, MA competes with a host of financial
training and education firms such as Omega Performance and providers of offshore research and analytical services such as Evalueserve and CRISIL Global Research & Analytics.

MOODY’S STRATEGY

Moody’s corporate
strategy is to be the world’s most respected authority serving financial risk-sensitive markets. The key aspects to implement this strategy are to:

»

Defend and enhance the core ratings and research business of MIS;

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



»

Build MA’s position as a leading provider of data, analytics and risk management solutions to financial institutions, corporations, and governmental authorities; and

»

Invest in strategic growth opportunities.

Moody’s will make investments to defend and enhance its core businesses in
an attempt to position the Company to fully capture market opportunities resulting from global debt capital market expansion and increased business investment spending. Moody’s will also make strategic investments to achieve scale in attractive
financial information markets, move into attractive product and service adjacencies where the Company can leverage its brand, extend its thought leadership and expand its geographic presence in high growth emerging markets.

To broaden the Company’s potential, MA provides a wide range of products and services to enable financial institutions, corporations and governmental authorities to
better manage risk. As such, MA adds to the Company’s value proposition in three ways. First, MA’s subscription businesses provide a significant base of recurring revenue to offset cyclicality in ratings issuance volumes that may result in
volatility in MIS’s revenues. Second, MA products and services, such as financial training and professional services on research and risk management best practices, provide opportunities for entry into emerging markets before banking systems
and debt capital markets fully develop and thus present long-term growth opportunities for the ratings business. Finally, MA’s integrated risk management software platform embeds Moody’s solutions deep into the technology infrastructure of
banks and insurance companies worldwide.

Moody’s invests in initiatives to implement the Company’s strategy, including internally led organic development
and targeted acquisitions. Example initiatives include:

»

Enhancements to ratings quality and product extensions;

»

Investments that extend ownership and participation in joint ventures and strategic alliances;

»

New products, services, content (e.g., non-credit risk assessments such as ESG and cybersecurity risk), and technology capabilities to meet customer demands;

»

Selective bolt-on acquisitions that accelerate the ability to scale and grow Moody’s businesses; and

»

Expansion in emerging markets.

During 2017, Moody’s continued to invest in and acquire complementary businesses in
MIS and MA. In February 2017, Moody’s acquired the structured finance data and analytics business of SCDM, a leading provider of analytical tools for participants in securitization markets in Europe. The acquisition further extended the
geographic footprint of MA’s structured finance analytics business, which includes extensive loan- and pool-level data for securitized assets, as well as cash flow analytics, risk monitoring and credit modelling tools that cover all major asset
classes worldwide. In June 2017, Moody’s invested in CompStak, a provider of commercial real estate lease information. Leveraging lease data provided by CompStak will help MA expand its product offering and develop new products and technologies
that serve the needs of commercial real estate finance and risk professionals. In August 2017, Moody’s completed the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk, a global provider of business intelligence and company information, for

€

3.0 billion. The acquisition of Bureau van Dijk extended MA’s offerings of small and medium size enterprise and private company information, strengthening Moody’s position as a leader in
financial risk data and analytical insight. Also in August 2017, Moody’s invested in SecurityScorecard, a leading provider of cybersecurity ratings. SecurityScorecard’s innovative cyber risk ratings, data and analytics are used by
information security, risk management, supply chain, and compliance practitioners to assess and monitor their security posture and secure their partner and vendor ecosystem. In November 2017, Moody’s invested in Rockport VAL, a provider of
cloud-based commercial real estate valuation and cash flow modeling tools.

Regulation

MIS and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries (including by state and local authorities). Thus,
existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being
considered. Each of the existing, adopted, proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact Moody’s operations or profitability, the
Company’s ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings, in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which Moody’s operates.

The regulatory landscape has changed rapidly in recent years, and continues to evolve. In the EU, the CRA industry is registered and supervised through a

pan-European

regulatory framework. The European Securities and Markets Authority has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered CRA industry throughout the EU. MIS is a registered entity and is subject to
formal regulation and periodic inspection. Applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory rotation
requirements of CRAs hired by issuers of securities for


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


ratings of resecuritizations, restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed, reporting requirements to ESMA regarding fees, and additional procedural and
substantive requirements on the pricing of services. In 2016, the Commission published a report concluding that no new European legislation was needed for the industry at that time, but that it would continue to monitor the credit rating industry
and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation. In addition, from time to time, ESMA publishes interpretive guidance or thematic reports regarding various aspects of the regulation. Over the past quarter, two such reports have been
published. The first report provides further guidance from ESMA regarding the endorsement mechanism that CRAs will need to employ for those ratings that are produced outside of the EU but are used inside the EU by

EU-regulated

entities. The second report discusses ESMA’s observations on CRAs fee practices.

Separately, on
June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted through a referendum to exit the EU. The UK officially launched the exit process by submitting its Article 50 letter to the EU, informing it of the UK’s intention to exit. The submission of this letter
“starts the clock” on the negotiation of the terms of exit which will take up to two years. The specifics regarding the “new relationship” or any transitional arrangements (bridging the UK’s exit from its

re-engagement

with the EU) will only begin once the broad terms of exit have been agreed upon by all parties.

The longer-term
impacts of the decision to leave the EU on the overall regulatory framework for the U.K. will depend, in part, on the relationship that the U.K. negotiates with the EU in the future. In the interim, however, the U.K.’s markets regulator (the
Financial Conduct Authority) has said that all EU financial regulations will stay in place and that firms must continue to abide by their existing obligations. As a consequence, at this point in time, there is no change to the regulatory framework
under which MIS operates and ESMA remains MIS’s regulator both in the EU and in the U.K.

In the U.S., CRAs are subject to extensive regulation primarily
pursuant to the Reform Act and the Financial Reform Act. The SEC is required by these legislative acts to publish two annual reports to Congress on NRSROs. The Financial Reform Act requires the SEC to examine each NRSRO once a year and issue an
annual report summarizing the examination findings, among other requirements. The annual report required by the Reform Act details the SEC’s views on the state of competition, transparency and conflicts of interests among NRSROs, among other
requirements. The SEC voted in August 2014 to adopt its final rules for NRSROs as required by the Financial Reform Act. The Company has made and continues to make substantial IT and other investments, and has implemented the relevant compliance
obligations.

In light of the regulations that have gone into effect in both the EU and the U.S. (as well as many other countries), periodically and as a matter of
course pursuant to their enabling legislation these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe their oversight activities over the industry. In addition, other legislation and/or interpretation of existing
regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future. Finally, in certain countries, governments may provide
financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. If enacted, any such legislation
and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which MIS operates. The legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in
the future. Management of the Company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted, the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings, or regulatory or legislative actions, or the ultimate impact of any such
matters on the competitive position, financial position or results of operations of Moody’s.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report
on Form

10-K

should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that
the Company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and
adversely affected. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on Form

U.S. Laws and Regulations Affecting the Credit Rating Industry May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business.

Moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S., including the Reform Act
and the Financial Reform Act. These regulations are complex, continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time. See “Regulation” in Part 1, Item 1 of this annual report on Form

seek to encourage, and may result in, increased competition among rating agencies and in the credit rating business;

may result in alternatives to credit ratings or changes in the pricing of credit ratings;

»

restrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings;

»

increase regulatory oversight of the credit markets and CRA operations;

»

provide for direct jurisdiction of the SEC over CRAs that seek NRSRO status, and grant authority to the SEC to inspect the operations of CRAs; and

»

authorize the adoption of enhanced oversight standards and new pleading standards, which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities
and aggregate legal defense costs.

These laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking or court rulings, could result in reduced demand for credit
ratings and increased costs, which Moody’s may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. The Company may be required to incur
significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to
accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on Moody’s business and its customers’ businesses. For example, new laws and regulations may affect MIS’s communications with issuers as part of the rating
assignment process, alter the manner in which MIS’s ratings are developed, assigned and communicated, affect the manner in which MIS or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for MIS’s ratings and alter the
economics of the credit ratings business, including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies. Further, speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential
liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect Moody’s stock price. Although these legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally, they may affect Moody’s in a
disproportionate manner. Each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for
credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.

Financial Reforms Outside the U.S. Affecting the Credit Rating Industry May Negatively Impact
the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business.

In addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations governing the industry, foreign
jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings. In particular, the EU has adopted a common regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the EU. As a result, ESMA has direct
supervisory authority for CRAs in the EU and has the power to take enforcement action against

non-compliant

CRAs, including through the issuance of public notices, withdrawal of registration and, in some
cases, the imposition of fines.

MIS is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection in the EU. Applicable rules include
procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory rotation requirements of CRAs hired by issuers of securities for ratings of
resecuritizations, and restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed. Additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings, rules regarding the organization
of CRAs, restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest, including fees that are based on costs and are

non-discriminatory,

and special requirements for the rating of structured finance
instruments. Compliance with the EU regulations may increase costs of operations and could have a significant negative effect on Moody’s operations, profitability or ability to compete, or the markets for its products and services, including in
ways that Moody’s presently is unable to predict. In addition, exposure to increased liability under the EU regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely
impact Moody’s results of operations.


MOODY’S

The EU and other jurisdictions engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that could significantly impact operations or the
markets for Moody’s products and services, including regulations extending to products and services not currently regulated and regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated, expansion of supervisory remit to include

non-EU

ratings used for regulatory purposes, increasing the level of competition in the market for credit ratings, establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit
ratings. Moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations, and the effect that they will have on Moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant. Financial reforms in the EU
and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company Faces
Exposure to Litigation and Government Regulatory Proceedings, Investigations and Inquiries Related to Rating Opinions and Other Business Practices.

Moody’s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries related to MIS’s ratings actions, as well as other
business practices and products. If the market value of credit-dependent instruments declines or defaults, whether as a result of difficult economic times, turbulent markets or otherwise, the number of investigations and legal proceedings that
Moody’s faces could increase significantly. Parties who invest in securities rated by MIS may pursue claims against MIS or Moody’s for losses they face in their portfolios. Moody’s has faced numerous class action lawsuits and other
litigation, government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Legal proceedings impose
additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues, and any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries
could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions. Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to
those that exist in the U.S. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful
litigations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify. Moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks
often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, to the extent that Moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial, the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by Moody’s
increase substantially, as does the risk of an adverse outcome. Additionally, as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, Moody’s may change its accounting estimates, which could require Moody’s to record
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the Company currently faces. Due to the
number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought, there is a risk that Moody’s will be subject to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other adverse results that could have a material adverse effect on its
business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company is Exposed to Legal, Economic, Operational and Regulatory Risks of Operating in Multiple
Jurisdictions.

Moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources.
Changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the Company operates may have an impact on the Company’s business. For example, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone or elsewhere could affect the number of securities
offerings undertaken within those particular areas. In addition, operations abroad expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as:

»

exposure to exchange rate movements between foreign currencies and USD;

»

restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into USD and the costs, including the tax impact, of repatriating cash held by entities outside the U.S.;

»

U.S. laws affecting overseas operations including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers;

»

differing and potentially conflicting legal or civil liability, compliance and regulatory standards, including as a result of the U.K.’s referendum vote to withdraw from the EU, Brexit;

»

current and future regulations relating to the imposition of mandatory rotation requirements on CRAs hired by issuers of securities;

»

uncertain and evolving laws and regulations, including those applicable to the financial services industries, such as the European Union’s implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, MiFID
II, in January 2018, and to the protection of intellectual property;

»

economic, political and geopolitical market conditions;

»

the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions;

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



»

competition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions;

»

uncertainties of obtaining data and creating products and services relevant to particular geographic markets;

»

reduced protection for intellectual property rights;

»

longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables;

»

differing accounting principles and standards;

»

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

»

difficulties and delays in translating documentation into foreign languages; and

»

potentially adverse tax consequences.

Additionally, Moody’s is subject to complex U.S., foreign and other local laws
and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Although the Company has implemented internal controls,
policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and
violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that the Company has violated anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with
international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to the Company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties,
criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s reputation, its ability to attract and retain employees, its business, operating results and financial condition.

Moody’s Operations and Infrastructure May Malfunction or Fail.

Moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities
in which Moody’s is located, including New York City, the location of Moody’s headquarters, major cities worldwide in which Moody’s has offices, and locations in China used for certain Moody’s back office work. This may include a
disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure (whether or not controlled by the Company), including the Company’s electronic delivery systems, data center facilities, or the Internet, used by the Company or third parties with or
through whom Moody’s conducts business. Many of the Company’s products and services are delivered electronically and the Company’s customers depend on the Company’s ability to receive, store, process, transmit and otherwise
rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data and transactions on computer-based networks. The Company’s customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of the Company’s telecommunications, data centers,
networks and other electronic delivery systems, including its websites and connections to the Internet. The Company’s employees also depend on these systems for internal use. Any significant failure, compromise, cyber-breach, interruption or a
significant slowdown of operations of the Company’s infrastructure, whether due to human error, capacity constraints, hardware failure or defect, natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures,

break-ins,

sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise, may impair the Company’s ability to deliver its products and services.

Moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful. The Company relies on third-party providers to
provide certain essential services. While the Company believes that such providers are reliable, the Company has limited control over the performance of such providers. To the extent any of the Company’s third-party providers ceases to provide
these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fails to adequately expand its services to meet the Company’s needs and the needs of the Company’s customers, the Company could experience lower revenues and higher costs.
Additionally, although the Company maintains processes to prevent, detect and recover from a disruption, the Company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and

low-risk

systems, and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of

non-essential

services. If a disruption occurs in one of Moody’s locations or
systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with Moody’s customers may
suffer. The Company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the Company’s failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to
Moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.

The
Company is Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Protection of Confidential Information.

The Company’s operations rely on the secure processing,
storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in the


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


Company’s computer systems and networks, and in those of its third party vendors. The cyber risks the Company faces range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced
threats that target the Company because of its prominence in the global marketplace, or due to its ratings of sovereign debt. Breaches of Moody’s or Moody’s vendors’ technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security
systems,

denial-of-service

attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, or malware, employee or insider error,
malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions, may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company’s or such vendors’ web sites, applications, data
processing, or disruption of other business operations, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the Company (including information about Moody’s business, employees or customers), as well as sensitive
personally identifiable information (“PII”), the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. Measures that Moody’s takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient,
circumvented, or may become ineffective. To conduct its operations, the Company regularly moves data across national borders, and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States
and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to Moody’s is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European
Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of
significant data breaches, becomes effective in May 2018. Additionally, other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements
impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.

The Company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security measures
in order to protect its systems and data, including employee training, disaster plans, and technical defenses, in order to protect its systems and data. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further
data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex, and sophisticated global cyber threats. Despite the Company’s best efforts, it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system
disruptions. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened
cybersecurity requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers. Any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the Company’s systems or
those of the Company’s third parties, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could cause the Company to experience reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory
penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the Company’s customers’ information, or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the Company. Any of the
foregoing may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities
Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets, Asset Levels and Flows into Investment Levels and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s
Business.

Moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets. Furthermore, issuers of
debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by

non-traditional

parties such as financial advisors, rather than traditional CRAs, such as MIS. A
majority of Moody’s credit-rating-based revenue is transaction-based, and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Market disruptions and economic slowdown and
uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings. The Tax Act, in addition to other changes to U.S. tax laws and policy, could negatively affect the
volume of debt securities issued in the U.S. For example, the Tax Act will limit deductibility on interest payments and significantly reduce the tax cost associated with the repatriation of cash held outside the U.S., both of which could negatively
affect the volume of debt securities issued. Conditions that reduce issuers’ ability or willingness to issue debt securities, such as market volatility, declining growth, currency devaluations or other adverse economic trends, reduce the number
and dollar-equivalent volume of debt issuances for which Moody’s provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees Moody’s earns in its ratings business.

Economic and government factors such as a long-term continuation of difficult economic conditions or a

re-emergence

of the
sovereign debt crisis in Europe may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. Future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates, widening credit spreads, regulatory and political developments, growth
in the use of alternative sources of credit, and defaults by significant issuers. Declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results and financial
condition.

Moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible
to obtain in the short term, due in part to rent, technology, compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the Company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings. Further, cost-reduction initiatives, including
those under-

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



taken to date, could make it difficult for the Company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings. Volatility in the financial markets,
including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates, may have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition, which the Company may not be able to successfully offset with cost
reductions.

The Company Faces Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers.

There is price competition in the credit rating, research, credit risk management markets, research and analytical services and financial training and certification
services. Moody’s faces competition globally from other CRAs and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research, as well as from

in-house

research operations. Competition
for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services, as well as increased competition from

non-NRSROs

that evaluate debt risk for
issuers or investors. At the same time, a challenging business environment and consolidation among customers, particularly those involved in structured finance products, and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors
and reduce the Company’s customer base. Weak economic growth intensifies competitive pricing pressures and can result in customers’ use of free or lower-cost information that is available from alternative sources. While Moody’s seeks
to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services, it may lose market share if its pricing is not sufficiently competitive. In addition, the Reform Act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies. The
formation of additional NRSROs may increase pricing and competitive pressures. Furthermore, in some of the countries in which Moody’s operates, governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies. Any inability of
Moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services could have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company is Exposed to Reputation and Credibility Concerns.

Moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths. To the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or Moody’s, relative to
its competitors, suffers a loss in credibility, Moody’s business could be significantly impacted. Factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a
conflict of interest, the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities, the timing and nature of changes in ratings, a major compliance failure, negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of
ratings, regulators and legislative bodies, including as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities and intentional or unintentional misrepresentations of Moody’s products and services in advertising
materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications. Operational errors, whether by Moody’s or a Moody’s competitor, could also harm the reputation of the Company or the credit rating industry. Damage to
reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition, as well as on the Company’s ability to find suitable candidates for acquisition.

The Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business.

The markets for credit ratings, research, credit risk management services, research and analytical services and financial training and certification services
are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer demands, and evolving regulatory requirements, industry standards and market preferences. The ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain
innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Moody’s competitors include both established companies with
significant financial resources, brand recognition, market experience and technological expertise, and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements. Competitors may
develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by
Moody’s, or may position, price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by Moody’s. Moody’s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and technology and information providers; these indirect
competitors could in the future choose to compete directly with Moody’s, cease doing business with Moody’s or change the terms under which it does business with Moody’s in a way that could negatively impact our business. In addition,
customers or others may develop alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk. Such developments could affect demand for Moody’s products and services and its growth prospects. Further, the increased availability in recent years of
free or relatively inexpensive Internet information may reduce the demand for Moody’s products and services. For example, in December 2016, ESMA launched a database providing access to free, current information on certain credit ratings and
rating outlooks. Moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by Moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide
adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors. Any inability of Moody to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business,
operating results and financial condition.

Possible Loss of Key Employees and Related Compensation Cost Pressures May Negatively Impact the Company.

Moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals.
Competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract high quality


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual
employees that would not be necessary in competing industries. As greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies, in the future, Moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that could
adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees. Investment banks, investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive
compensation packages than Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis.
There is a risk that even if the Company invests significant resources in attempting to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, it will not succeed in its efforts, and its business could be harmed.

Moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr., the President and Chief Executive Officer, and other senior officers and key
employees. The loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and Moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material
adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

Moody’s Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other Strategic Transactions or
Internal Technology Investments May Not Produce Anticipated Results Exposing the Company to Future Significant Impairment Charges Relating to its Goodwill, Intangible Assets or Property and Equipment.

Moody’s has entered into and expects to continue to enter into acquisition, disposition or other strategic transactions and expects to make various investments to
strengthen its business and grow the Company. Such transactions as well as internal technology investments present significant challenges and risks. The market for acquisition targets, dispositions and other strategic transactions is highly
competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect Moody’s ability to complete such transactions. If Moody’s is unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if opportunities for expansion do not arise, its
business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we make significant investments in technology including software developed for

internal-use

which is
time-intensive and complex to implement. Such investments may not be successful or may not result in the anticipated benefits resulting in asset write-offs.

In
August 2017, Moody’s acquired Bureau van Dijk for $3,542.0 million. The anticipated growth, synergies and other strategic objectives of the Bureau van Dijk acquisition, as well as other completed transactions, may not be fully realized,
and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. Any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks, including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations, technologies and new
employees; the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the Company prior to closing a transaction; unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures; scrutiny from competition and antitrust
authorities; failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business; future developments may impair the value of purchased goodwill or intangible assets; diverting management’s focus from other business operations; failing to implement or
remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business; and
for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. The anticipated benefits from an
acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. As a result, the failure of acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material
adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

At December 31, 2017, Moody’s had $3,753.2 million of goodwill and
$1,631.6 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet, both of which increased significantly due to the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk. Approximately 92% of the goodwill and intangible assets reside in the MA business, including those
related to Bureau van Dijk, and are allocated to the five reporting units within MA: RD&A; ERS; Financial Services Training and Certifications; Moody’s Analytics Knowledge Services; and Bureau van Dijk. The remaining 8% of goodwill and
intangible assets reside in MIS and primarily relate to ICRA. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in a significant asset impairment charge, which would result in a

non-cash

charge to operating expenses. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.
Determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil, and requires significant management estimates and judgment. In addition, the potential for goodwill impairment
is increased during periods of economic uncertainty. An asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company’s Compliance and Risk Management Programs May Not be Effective and May Result in Outcomes That Could Adversely Affect the Company’s
Reputation, Financial Condition and Operating Results.

Moody’s operates in a number of countries, and as a result the Company is required to comply and
quickly adapt with numerous international and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The Company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations,

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



including anti-corruption laws, is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance, review and reporting systems, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified
compliance and risk management personnel. Moody’s policies and procedures to identify, evaluate and manage the Company’s risks, including risks resulting from acquisitions, may not be fully effective, and Moody’s employees or agents
may engage in misconduct, fraud or other errors. It is not always possible to deter such errors, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. If Moody’s employees violate its
policies or if the Company’s risk management methods are not effective, the Company could be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of the Company’s employees, fines, penalties, regulatory sanctions, injunctive relief,
exclusion from certain markets or other penalties, and may suffer harm to its reputation, financial condition and operating results.

Legal Protections for the
Company’s Intellectual Property Rights may not be Sufficient or Available to Protect the Company’s Competitive Advantages.

Moody’s considers
many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary. Failure to protect the Company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the Company’s ability to compete effectively. Businesses the Company
acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges the Company faces in protecting its strategic advantage. In addition, the Company’s operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing
legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. On January 6, 2015, a rule with direct relevance to the CRA industry was published in the Official Journal of the European
Union regarding the types of information that CRAs are to provide about certain ratings (those that were paid for by issuers) for publication on a central website administered by ESMA (the European Ratings Platform). This rule directly relates to
the Company’s intellectual property as it requires that the Company provide proprietary information at no cost that the Company currently sells, which could result in lost revenue. ESMA launched the European Rating Platform for public use on
December 1, 2016.

Unauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the Company regards as proprietary. It is also
possible that Moody’s competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that Moody’s offers, and attempt to require Moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to
modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing, or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services. Even if Moody’s attempts to assert or protect its
intellectual property rights through litigation, it may require considerable cost, time and resources to do so, and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. These risks, and the cost, time and resources needed to address them, may
increase as the Company’s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the United States.

The Company is Dependent on the Use of Third-Party Software, Data, Hosted Solutions, Data Centers, Cloud and Network Infrastructure (Together, “Third
Party Technology”), and Any Reduction in Third-Party Product Quality or Service Offerings, Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations.

Moody’s relies on Third Party Technology in connection with its product development and offerings and operations. The Company depends on the ability of Third Party
Technology providers to deliver and support reliable products, enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. The Third Party
Technology Moody’s uses may become obsolete, incompatible with future versions of the Company’s products, unavailable or fail to operate effectively, and Moody’s business could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to timely
or effectively replace such Third Party Technology. The Company also monitors its use of Third Party Technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements. Despite the Company’s efforts, the Company cannot ensure that
such third parties will permit Moody’s use in the future, resulting in increased Third Party Technology acquisition costs and loss of rights. In addition, the Company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for
Third Party Technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to Third Party Technology are substantial. Some of these third-party suppliers are also Moody’s competitors, increasing the risks noted above. If any of these risks
materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Changes in Tax Rates or
Tax Rules Could Affect Future Results.

As a global company, Moody’s is subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and
jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is determined based on the pre-tax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of
earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors, including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where Moody’s faces higher tax rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which Moody’s is not able to realize the
related tax benefit, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the tax, accounting and other laws, treaties, regulations, policies and administrative practices, or changes to their interpretation or enforcement, including changes
applicable to multinational corporations such as the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project being conducted by the Organization for Economic

Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets, Asset Levels and Flows into Investment Levels and Changes in Interest Rates and
Other Volatility in the Financial Markets May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business.

In addition, Moody’s is subject
to regular examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and the Company is experiencing increased scrutiny as its business grows. Moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or
unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits; however, developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect the
Company. Although the Company believes its tax estimates and accruals are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its historical income tax provisions,
accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.

(1)

The significant change in 2016 and 2017 is primarily driven by the $863.8 million Settlement Charge ($700.7 million, net of tax, or $3.59 per diluted share) in 2016.

(2)

The decline in operating cash flow in 2017 is primarily due to payments made relating to the Settlement Charge. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted ASU

No. 2016-09

“Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”. As required by ASU

2016-09,

Excess Tax Benefits or shortfalls relating to employee
stock-based compensation are reflected in operating cash flow and the Company has applied this provision on a retrospective basis. Under previous accounting guidance, Excess Tax Benefits or shortfalls were shown as a reduction to operating cash flow
and an increase to financing cash flow.

(3)

Provision for income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a net charge of $245.6 million related to the impact of U.S. tax reform and a statutory tax rate reduction in Belgium as more fully
discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form

10-K.

(4)

The 2017 amount includes a $111.1 million Purchase Price Hedge Gain as well as the $59.7 million CCXI Gain. The 2016 amount includes an approximate $35 million FX gain relating to the substantial
liquidation of a subsidiary. The 2015, 2014 and 2013 amounts include benefits of $7.1 million, $7.1 million and $22.8 million, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain Legacy Tax Matters. The 2014 amount also
includes the ICRA Gain of $102.8 million.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form

10-K.

This MD&A contains Forward-Looking
Statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” commencing on page 58 and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” commencing on page 18 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.

THE COMPANY

Moody’s is a provider of
(i) credit ratings; (ii) credit, capital markets and economic research, data and analytical tools; (iii) software solutions that support financial risk management activities; (iv) quantitatively derived credit scores; (v)
financial services training and certification services; (vi) offshore financial research and analytical services; and (vii) company information and business intelligence products. Moody’s reports in two reportable segments: MIS and
MA.

MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide.
Revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain

non-ratings-related

operations which consist primarily of financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA’s

non-ratings

operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global
financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including

in-depth

research on major debt issuers, industry studies and
commentary on topical credit-related events. The RD&A business also produces economic research and data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores as well as business intelligence and company information products. Within its
ERS business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. The PS business provides offshore research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Moody’s
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires
Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting
periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets (including the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets), pension and other retirement benefits and UTBs. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting
estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.

Pursuant to ASC Topic 605, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price
which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

The Company’s products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under ASC Topic 605. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an
arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right
relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. In instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined
with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



The Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the VSOE criteria by using the price
charged for a deliverable when sold separately or, if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority to establish such a price. In instances where the Company is not able to
establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history,
the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. However, due to
the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or
customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASC Topic 605, when the Company
is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best
estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related
product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis
or more frequently as needed.

In the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is delivered to the
issuer. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, structured credit,
international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated
securities, which was approximately 24 years on a weighted average basis at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $140.1 million, $133.0 million,
and $121.0 million.

Multiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. In
instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The Company
generally uses ESP in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely provides initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings.

MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding.
Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
accounts receivable included approximately $27.0 million, $25.0 million, and $24.0 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue
and the actual billings. Furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
accounts receivable included approximately $185.0 million, $159.1 million, and $146.4 million, respectively, relating to accrued annual monitoring service revenue.

In the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from
subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from
sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the
product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are
performed. A large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.

Products and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element arrangement
includes software and

non-software

deliverables, revenue is allocated to the

non-software

deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative
selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.

If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each
software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to determine VSOE for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


residual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an undelivered element, the Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the
Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements. In cases where software implementation services are considered essential and VSOE of fair value exists for post-contract customer support
(“PCS”), once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a

percentage-of-completion

basis as
implementation services are performed, while PCS is recognized over the coverage period. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for PCS, once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero profit
margin basis until essential services are complete, at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining PCS coverage period. If VSOE does not exist for PCS at the beginning of an arrangement but is
established during implementation, revenue not recognized due to the absence of VSOE will be recognized on a cumulative basis.

Accounts Receivable Allowance

Moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current
conditions. Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual
billing adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and invoice adjustment experience as well as the
current aging status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody’s adjusts
its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments
to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual
write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

Contingencies

Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of
judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial
statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed
appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.

For claims,
litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in
the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a
better estimate than another amount within the range. In other instances, where a loss is reasonably possible, management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, but
discloses the contingency if material. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation,
regulatory, governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a
large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how
its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information
available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar
court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.

The Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the Company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation,
employment practices litigation, employee medical claims and terrorism, for which the claims are not material to the Company. In addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the Company for defense costs

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



related to professional liability claims. For matters insured by the Company’s insurance subsidiary, Moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid
and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion. The Company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially
determined estimates. Defense costs for matters not self-insured by the Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided.

For
income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is

more-likely-than-not

(defined as a likelihood of more than
fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets
this

more-likely-than-not

threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

As of July 31 of each
year, Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.

The
Company has seven primary reporting units: two within the Company’s ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody’s other ratings operations) and five reporting units within MA: RD&A, ERS, FSTC, MAKS
and Bureau van Dijk. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process,

in-depth

research on major debt issuers,
industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The ERS reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial
institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry. These products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold on a subscription basis. The FSTC reporting
unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and implementation services. The MAKS reporting unit provides offshore research and analytical services. The Bureau
van Dijk reporting unit consists of the newly acquired Bureau van Dijk business, which was acquired on August 10, 2017, and primarily provides business intelligence and company information products.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a

two-step

impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the
first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist,
the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the
fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the
Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting
unit’s fair value. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions or realignments. For the reporting units where the Company is
consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the Company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years. At
July 31, 2017, the Company performed a qualitative assessment on all reporting units except for MAKS, which resulted in no indicators of impairment of goodwill.

In January 2017 there was a management change in the MAKS business. A quantitative impairment assessment for the MAKS reporting unit was performed as of July 31,
2017 to reflect the completion of a new strategic plan for this reporting unit under new management (the Company’s annual strategic plan is completed in the third quarter of each year). This quantitative assessment resulted in no impairment of
goodwill for the MAKS reporting unit at July 31, 2017.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset involves
the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions,
and appropriate comparable market metrics. However, as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, actual future results may differ from these estimates. In addition, the Company also makes certain judgments and
assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.

Other assets and liabilities, including
applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.

Bureau van Dijk was acquired subsequent to the Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of July 31, 2017. Due to the close proximity of the Bureau van Dijk acquisition to December 31, 2017, the
purchase price approximates the fair value of the reporting unit. Additionally, the Company has not completed its allocation of certain of the goodwill acquired to other MA reporting units that are anticipated to benefit from synergies resulting
from the Bureau van Dijk acquisition.

Methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining of the fair value of reporting units:

The following is a discussion regarding the Company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding ICRA, as of the date
of each reporting unit’s last quantitative assessment (July 31, 2017 for MAKS; July 31, 2016 for the remaining reporting units). As ICRA is a publicly traded company in India, the Company was able to observe its fair value based on its
market capitalization.

The fair value of each reporting unit, excluding ICRA, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company
and precedent transaction multiples. The DCF analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that is based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term
growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could
result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the
reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition.

The sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and WACC assumptions described below are as of the date of
the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit. The following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment:

»

Future cash flow assumptions

—The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting
unit. These projections are consistent with the Company’s operating and strategic plan. Cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis were utilized in the determination of the fair value
of each reporting unit. The growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets, new customer acquisition and new products. Beyond five years, a terminal value was determined
using a perpetuity growth rate based on expected inflation and real GDP growth rates. A sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units. For all reporting units, a 10% decrease in the revenue growth rates used
would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value.

»

WACC

—The WACC is the rate used to discount each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows. The WACC is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of
equity is based on a risk-free interest rate, an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit’s cash flows.
The cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the Company’s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the WACC. The cost of debt and
equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. The WACC for all reporting units ranged from 8.5% to 10.5%. Differences in the WACC used between
reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. A sensitivity analysis of the WACC was performed on all reporting units whereby an increase in the WACC of one percentage
point would not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value.

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no such events or changes during 2017 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the Company’s reporting units may not be recoverable. This
determination was made based on continued growth, consistent with operating and strategic plans for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides.

Pension
and Other Retirement Benefits

The expenses, assets and liabilities that Moody’s reports for its Retirement Plans are dependent on many assumptions
concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These significant assumptions include the following:

»

future compensation increases are based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook;

»

long-term expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally
comprised of equity and fixed-income investments); and

»

discount rates are based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.

The discount rates used to measure
the present value of the Company’s benefit obligation for its Retirement Plans as of December 31, 2017 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with
the corresponding yield on the Citibank pension discount curve. The cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.

Moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the
Company consults with third-party actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a
significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s Retirement Plans. Additionally, the Company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale

MP-2017

to accompany the

RP-2014

mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the Society of Actuaries.

When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. Excluding differences between the expected long-term rate of return
assumption and actual returns on plan assets, the Company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent
that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the

beginning-of-year

projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. For Moody’s
Retirement Plans, the total actuarial losses as of December 31, 2017 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $123.2 million, and Moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of $6.0 million in 2018 related to
the amortization of actuarial losses.

For Moody’s funded U.S. pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual
experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under ASC Topic 715, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market-related value of assets that is used
in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has an unrecognized asset loss of
$16.1 million, of which $2.1 million will be recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2019 expense.

The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody’s 2018 income before provision for
income taxes. These effects have been calculated using the Company’s current projections of 2018 expenses, assets and liabilities related to Moody’s Retirement Plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.

Income Taxes

The Company is
subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany
transactions. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of
temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.

The Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness
of liabilities for UTBs. The Company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other

non-operating

expenses.

For UTBs, ASC Topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is

more-likely-than-not

(defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will
examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this

more-likely-than-not

threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is
greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of liabilities related to UTBs and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company,
there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the Company’s operating results or financial condition.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law which resulted in significant changes to U.S. corporate tax laws. The Tax Act includes a mandatory

one-time

deemed repatriation tax (“transition tax”) on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and reduces the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Due to
the complexities involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, in 2017 the Company recorded a provisional estimate of $247.3 million related to the transition tax. A portion of this amount will be payable over eight years, starting in
2018, and will not accrue interest. Also in 2017, a provisional estimate of $56.2 million was recorded decreasing net deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate. The above provisional estimates may
be impacted by a number of additional considerations, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations and our ongoing analysis of the new law.

Other
Estimates

In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moody’s consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax
assets, valuation of investments in affiliates and the estimated lives of amortizable intangible assets. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial
statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material
adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information
on significant accounting policies that impact Moody’s.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

The Company is organized into two reportable segments at December 31, 2017: MIS and MA.

The MIS segment is comprised primarily of all of the Company’s ratings operations consisting of five LOBs—CFG, SFG, FIG, PPIF and MIS Other. The ratings LOBs
generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. The MIS Other LOB consists of certain

non-ratings

operations managed by MIS which consists of

non-rating

revenue from ICRA and fixed income pricing service operations in the Asia-Pacific region.

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global
financial markets as well as serving as provider of business intelligence and company information. The MA segment consists of three lines of business—RD&A, ERS and PS. The results of operations for MA and revenue for the RD&A LOB for
the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 include the financial results from Bureau van Dijk which was acquired on August 10, 2017.

The following
is a discussion of the results of operations of the Company and its reportable segments. Total MIS revenue and total MA expenses include the intersegment royalty revenue for MIS and expense charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content,
data and products developed by MIS. The royalty rate charged by MIS approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content, data and products developed by MIS. Total MA revenue and total MIS expenses include intersegment fees charged to MIS from
MA for the

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



use of certain MA products and services in MIS’s ratings process. These fees charged by MA are generally equal to the costs incurred by MA to provide these products and services. Overhead
charges and corporate expenses that exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company that benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a
revenue-split methodology. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resources and information technology.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, in conjunction with the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk, the Company modified its definition of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted
Diluted EPS to exclude the impact of amortization of all acquisition-related intangible assets. Refer to the section entitled

“Non-GAAP

Financial Measures” of this Management Discussion and Analysis
for further information regarding this measure.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year ended December 31, 2017 compared with year ended December 31, 2016

Executive Summary

»

Moody’s completed the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk on August 10, 2017. Moody’s results of operations include Bureau van Dijk’s operating results beginning as of August 10, 2017.

»

Moody’s revenue in 2017 totaled $4,204.1 million, an increase of $599.9 million, or 17%, compared to 2016 reflecting strong growth in both segments.

»

MIS revenue was 17% higher compared to the prior year with growth across all ratings LOBs. The most notable growth was in the CFG LOB mainly due to strong leveraged finance issuance across all regions reflecting
favorable market conditions and increased investor demand for higher yielding securities.

»

MA revenue grew 16% compared to the prior year reflecting growth across all LOBs. The most notable growth was in the RD&A LOB which reflected increases in credit research subscriptions and licensing of credit data
as well as an approximate $92 million contribution from Bureau van Dijk (net of an approximate $36 million reduction relating to a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting as further described in Note 7 to the
financial statements), providing approximately seven percentage points to growth.

»

Total operating expenses excluding D&A decreased $602.1 million, or 21% compared to 2016 reflecting the $863.8 million Settlement Charge in 2016. This decrease is partially offset by higher compensation
costs in 2017 which reflects growth in performance-based compensation resulting from strong financial performance in 2017 coupled with annual merit increases. Additionally, there was approximately $64 million in Bureau van Dijk operating
expenses and $22.5 million in Acquisition-Related Expenses in 2017.

»

D&A increased $31.6 million primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the Bureau van Dijk acquisition.

»

Operating income of $1,809.1 million in 2017 increased $1,170.4 million compared to 2016 and resulted in an operating margin of 43.0%, compared to 17.7% in the prior year. Operating income and operating margin
in 2016 were suppressed by the $863.8 million Settlement Charge. Adjusted Operating Income of $1,989.9 million in 2017 increased $348.7 million compared to 2016, resulting in an Adjusted Operating Margin of 47.3% compared to 45.5% in
the prior year.

»

The decrease in

non-operating

expense, net, compared to the prior year is primarily due to:

»

the $59.7 million CCXI Gain in 2017;

»

the $111.1 million Purchase Price Hedge Gain in 2017;

Partially offset by:

»

higher interest expense of $50.6 million primarily reflecting additional financing in 2017 utilized to fund the payment of the 2016 Settlement Charge, repay the Series

2007-1

Notes and fund the Bureau van Dijk acquisition.

»

FX losses of approximately $17 million in the 2017 compared to FX gains of approximately $50 million in the prior year. The FX gains in 2016 included approximately $35 million related to the liquidation
of a

non-U.S.

subsidiary.

»

The ETR of 43.6% in 2017 includes a net charge of approximately $246 million in the fourth quarter related to the impacts of tax reform in the U.S. and Belgium partially offset by the

non-taxable

CCXI Gain and an approximate $40 million benefit relating to Excess Tax Benefits on stock-based compensation. The 2016 ETR of 50.6% included the

non-deductible

nature of the federal portion of the Settlement Charge.

Includes 874 employees from the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk

Global revenue of $4,204.1 million in 2017 increased
$599.9 million, or 17%, compared to 2016 and reflected strong growth in both MIS and MA.

The $403.0 million increase in MIS revenue primarily reflects
strong global leveraged finance rated issuance volumes in CFG as issuers took advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance obligations in 2017 as well as growth in the banking sector within FIG and in CLO issuance in SFG. Additionally, the
increase over prior year reflects benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were partially offset by lower U.S. public finance refunding volumes.

The $196.9 million increase in MA revenue primarily reflects higher RD&A revenue across all regions driven by
growth in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data as well as the contribution from the Bureau van Dijk acquisition of approximately $92 million (net of an approximate $36 million reduction relating to a deferred revenue
adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting as further described in Note 7 to the financial statements).

Transaction revenue accounted for 50% of global
MCO revenue in 2017, compared to 49% in 2016.

U.S. revenue of $2,348.4 million in 2017 increased $242.9 million over the prior year, reflecting growth in
both reportable segments.

Non-U.S.

revenue increased $357.0 million from 2016 reflecting growth in both reportable
segments.

Operating expenses were $1,222.8 million in 2017, up $196.2 million from 2016, primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation
expenses (including annual bonuses, a profit sharing contribution and performance-based equity compensation), which is correlated with the strong financial performance of the Company in 2017. This increase also reflects higher salaries and employee
benefit expenses resulting from the impact of annual compensation increases and increases in headcount coupled with Bureau van Dijk expenses.

SG&A expenses of
$991.4 million in 2017 increased $55.0 million from the prior year period primarily due to higher performance-based compensation costs (including annual bonuses, a profit sharing contribution and performance-based equity compensation),
which is correlated with the strong financial performance of the Company in 2017 coupled with Bureau van Dijk expenses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of cost management initiatives implemented in 2016 that have benefited 2017
as well as lower legal costs.

D&A increased $31.6 million primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the Bureau van Dijk
acquisition.

Acquisition-Related Expenses represent expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk.

Operating income of $1,809.1 million increased $1,170.4 million from 2016. Operating margin was 43.0% compared to 17.7% in 2016. Operating income and operating
margin in 2016 were suppressed by the $863.8 million Settlement Charge. Adjusted Operating Income was $1,989.9 million in 2017, an increase of $348.7 million compared to 2016. Adjusted Operating Margin of 47.3% increased 180 BPS
compared to the prior year.

Interest (expense) income, net in 2017 was $(188.4) million, a $50.6 million increase in expense compared to 2016 primarily due to:
i) interest on the 2017 Senior Notes and 2017 Floating Rate Senior Notes which were issued in the first quarter of 2017 to fund the payment of the 2016 Settlement Charge and repayment of the Series

2007-1

Notes; ii) interest on the 2017 Private Placement Notes Due 2023 and 2028 both issued in June 2017 coupled with interest on the 2017 Term Loan drawn down in August 2017, all of which were issued to fund the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk; and iii)
fees on the undrawn 2017 Bridge Credit Facility also related to the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk.

Other

non-operating

(expense) income, net was $(4.7) million in 2017, a $61.8 million change compared to 2016 primarily reflecting approximately $17 million in FX losses in 2017 compared to approximately $50 million in FX gains in the prior year. The FX
gains in 2016 included an approximate $35 million gain related to the liquidation of a

non-U.S.

subsidiary.

Additionally, Moody’s recognized the $59.7 million CCXI Gain and the $111.1 million Purchase Price Hedge Gain in 2017.

The ETR of 43.6% in 2017 includes a net charge of approximately $246 million in the fourth quarter related to the impacts of corporate tax reform in the U.S. and
Belgium partially offset by the

non-taxable

CCXI Gain and an approximate $40 million benefit reflecting the adoption on a prospective basis of a new accounting standard relating to Excess Tax Benefits on
stock-based compensation. In accordance with a new accounting standard, these Excess Tax Benefits are now recorded to the provision for income taxes, whereas in the prior year were recorded to capital surplus (refer to Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements for further discussion on this new accounting standard). The 2016 ETR of 50.6% included the

non-deductible

nature of the federal portion of the Settlement Charge. The impact of the
aforementioned tax reform in the U.S. is expected to reduce the Company’s ETR in years subsequent to 2017. For the full-year ended December 31, 2018, the Company expects the ETR to be between 22% and 23%.

The following is a discussion of external MIS revenue and operating expenses:

Global MIS revenue of $2,773.8 million in 2017 was up 17% compared to 2016, most notably from strong leveraged finance rated issuance volumes within CFG coupled with
strong growth in banking-related revenue in FIG and increases across most asset classes in SFG. Also contributing to the growth was the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases.


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


Transaction revenue for MIS was 65% in 2017 compared to 61% in 2016.

In the U.S., revenue was $1,702.8 million in 2017, an increase of $200.9 million or 13%, compared to 2016 primarily reflecting strong growth in CFG, SFG and FIG
revenue being partially offset by declines in PPIF and MIS Other revenue.

Non-U.S.

revenue was $1,071.0 million in 2017,
an increase of $202.1 million or 23%, compared to 2016 reflecting growth across all LOBs excluding MIS Other.

Global CFG revenue of $1,392.7 million in
2017 was up 24% compared to 2016 primarily due to strength in leveraged finance issuance in the U.S., EMEA and Asia-Pacific as issuers took advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance obligations and fund M&A activity. The growth in
leveraged finance revenue also reflects benefits from a favorable issuance mix in 2017 compared to the prior year where issuance volumes included a greater number of lower-yielding jumbo deals. The increase over the prior year also reflects higher
investment-grade corporate debt revenue in the U.S. reflecting continued favorable market conditions and benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as growth in monitoring fees across all regions.
Transaction revenue represented 73% of total CFG revenue in 2017, compared to 68% in the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue was $909.7 million, or 19% higher compared to the prior year. Internationally, revenue of $483.0 million
increased 34% compared to the prior year.

Global SFG revenue of $495.5 million in 2017 increased $58.7 million, or 13%, compared to 2016. In the U.S.,
revenue of $340.1 million increased $46.8 million over 2016 primarily due to strong growth in CLO issuance reflecting an increase in bank loan supply and favorable market conditions which enabled both new securitizations and a surge in
refinancing activity.

Non-U.S.

revenue in 2017 of $155.4 million increased $11.9 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth across most asset classes in the EMEA region.
Transaction revenue was 65% of total SFG revenue in 2017 compared to 62% in the prior year.

Global FIG revenue of $435.8 million in 2017 increased
$66.9 million, or 18%, compared to 2016. In the U.S., revenue of $186.1 million increased $26.0 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher issuance in the banking sector and benefits from changes in the mix of fee
type, new fee initiatives and price increases. Internationally, revenue was $249.7 million in 2017, up $40.9 million compared to 2016 primarily due to higher banking revenue in EMEA from opportunistic issuance amidst current favorable
market conditions as well as benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. The

non-U.S.

growth also reflects strength in banking revenue in the Asia-Pacific region
reflecting higher cross-border issuance from Chinese banks and the

non-bank

financial sector. Transaction revenue was 45% of total FIG revenue in 2017 compared to 37% in 2016.

Global PPIF revenue was $431.3 million in 2017 and increased $19.1 million, or 5%, compared to 2016. In the U.S., revenue in 2017 was $266.4 million and
decreased $9.8 million compared to 2016 primarily due to strong PFG refunding volumes in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by growth in infrastructure finance revenue coupled with benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee
initiatives and pricing increases. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue was $164.9 million and increased $28.9 million compared to 2016 reflecting strong growth in infrastructure finance revenue in the Asia-Pacific region and growth in public
finance revenue in EMEA. Transaction revenue was 65% of total PPIF revenue in 2017 compared to 63% in the prior year.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2017
increased $128.8 million compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in performance-based compensation resulting from strong financial performance in 2017 coupled with increased headcount and higher salaries and employee benefits costs reflecting
annual compensation increases. These increases were partially offset by lower legal fees and continued cost control initiatives.

Adjusted Operating Income and
operating income in 2017, which includes intersegment royalty revenue and intersegment expenses, were $1,638.6 million and $1,563.9 million, respectively, and increased $283.2 million and $1,156.3 million, respectively, compared
to 2016. Adjusted Operating Margin was 56.8% or 190 BPS higher than the prior year. Operating margin was 54.2% in 2017 compared to 16.5% in the prior year. Operating income and operating margin in 2016 were suppressed due to the Settlement Charge.

The following is a discussion of external MA revenue and operating expenses:

Global MA revenue increased $196.9 million, or 16%, compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in RD&A (which included approximately $92 million in revenue,
or 7 percentage points of the growth, from the Bureau van Dijk acquisition) coupled with growth in ERS, which included revenue from the first quarter 2016 acquisition of GGY. Additionally, the growth over the prior year reflects benefits from higher
fees within MA’s recurring revenue base due to enhanced content and continued alignment of usage and licensing parameters. Recurring revenue comprised 78% and 75% of total MA revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

In the U.S., revenue of $645.6 million in 2017 increased $42.0 million, and reflected growth across all LOBs.

Non-U.S.

revenue of $784.7 million in 2017 was $154.9 million higher than in 2016 reflecting growth in RD&A, which
included approximately $82 million in

non-U.S.

Bureau van Dijk revenue, and higher ERS revenue.

Global RD&A revenue
of $832.7 million, which comprised 58% and 54% of total external MA revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively, increased $165.1 million, or 25%, over the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue of $424.4 million increased
$35.1 million compared to 2016.

Non-U.S.

revenue of $408.3 million increased $130.0 million compared to the prior year. RD&A revenue in 2017 included approximately $92 million in
revenue, or 14 percentage points of the growth, from the Bureau van Dijk acquisition (net of an approximate $36 million reduction relating to a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting as further described in Note
7 to the financial statements). RD&A revenue growth also reflects strong results in the credit research and rating data feeds product lines, where enhanced content and continued alignment of usage and licensing parameters have generated higher
fees.

Global ERS revenue of $448.6 million in 2017 increased $29.8 million, or 7%, over 2016. The growth is primarily due to higher revenue from risk and
finance analytics products coupled with incremental revenue from GGY, which was acquired in March 2016. Additionally, the revenue growth reflects benefits from pricing increases within ERS’s recurring revenue base. Revenue in ERS is subject to
quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of software implementation and license revenue in a relatively small number of engagements. In the U.S., revenue of $166.6 million increased
$3.7 million compared to the prior year.

Non-U.S.

revenue of $282.0 million increased $26.1 million compared to the prior year.

Global PS revenue of $149.0 million in 2017 increased 1% compared to 2016 reflecting higher revenue from analytical and research services in the U.S. mostly offset
by lower revenue from these services internationally. In the U.S., revenue in 2017 was $54.6 million, up 6% compared to 2016. International revenue was $94.4 million, down 1% compared to 2016.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2017 increased $122.4 million compared to 2016. The expense growth includes an approximate $74 million increase in
compensation costs reflecting $32 million in Bureau van Dijk compensation costs coupled with annual salary


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


increases, higher performance-based compensation and higher severance costs partially offset by the impact of cost control initiatives.

Non-compensation

costs increased approximately $48 million primarily due to Bureau van Dijk expenses.

There were $22.5 million in Acquisition-Related Expenses incurred to
complete and integrate the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk.

Depreciation and amortization increased $30.7 million primarily due to the amortization of Bureau van
Dijk’s intangible assets.

Adjusted Operating Income was $351.3 million in 2017 and increased $65.5 million compared to the same period in 2016.
Operating income of $245.2 million in 2017 increased $14.1 million compared to the same period in 2016. Adjusted Operating Margin in 2017 was 24.3%, up 140BPS from 2016. Operating margin was 17.0% in 2017, down 150BPS from the prior year
reflecting the aforementioned $22.5 million in Bureau van Dijk Acquisition-Related Expenses coupled with approximately $31 million of higher D&A primarily relating to Bureau van Dijk’s intangible assets. Adjusted Operating Income
and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015

Executive Summary

»

Moody’s revenue in 2016 totaled $3,604.2 million, an increase of $119.7 million, or 3%, compared to 2015 reflecting good growth in MA revenue coupled with modest growth in MIS revenue.

»

MIS revenue was 2% higher compared to the prior year reflecting robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as for public finance related activity in the second half of 2016. The
growth also reflected benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were mostly offset by challenges in the first half of 2016 in the high-yield and investment-grade corporate debt sectors
due to elevated credit spreads and market volatility. Additionally, there was lower securitization activity in the U.S. in the first half of 2016, most notably in the U.S. CLO and CMBS asset classes, which reflected the aforementioned elevated
credit spreads and market volatility as well as uncertainty relating to the implementation of risk retention regulatory requirements for these asset classes.

»

MA revenue grew 7% compared to the prior year reflecting growth in ERS and RD&A, most notably in the U.S. Revenue grew in most product areas of ERS and included revenue from the acquisition of GGY. In RD&A,
revenue growth was primarily driven by credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, MA revenue grew 10%.

»

Total operating expenses increased $954.4 million or 47%, reflecting:

»

an $863.8 million Settlement Charge relating to the MIS segment pursuant to an agreement with the DOJ and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia;

»

higher compensation costs of $88.1 million associated with headcount growth in MA (including costs from the acquisition of GGY) and annual compensation increases company-wide partially offset by cost reduction
initiatives in response to the challenging business conditions in MIS during the first half of 2016; and

»

a restructuring charge of $12.0 million associated with cost management initiatives in the MIS segment as well as in certain corporate overhead functions.

»

Operating income of $638.7 million in 2016, which included the aforementioned $863.8 million Settlement Charge, was down $834.7 million compared to 2015 and resulted in an operating margin of 17.7%,
compared to 42.3% in the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income of $1,641.2 million in 2016 was up modestly compared to 2015, while Adjusted Operating Margin of 45.5% remained flat compared to 2015.

»

The change in

non-operating

income (expense) net, compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher FX gains which included an approximate $35 million gain related to the
liquidation of a

non-U.S.

subsidiary and an approximate $15 million gain relating to the appreciation of the euro relative to the British pound during 2016. Partially offsetting these increases was higher
interest expense reflecting the 2015 Senior Notes issued in March 2015 and the $300 million of additional borrowings under the 2014 Senior Notes

(30-Year)

in November 2015.

»

The ETR was 50.6% in 2016 compared to 31.2% in the prior year with the increase primarily reflecting the

non-deductible

nature of the federal portion of the aforementioned
Settlement Charge.

Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization, decreased $3.27 compared to 2015. Excluding all of the aforementioned items in 2016 and a $0.03 benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter and $0.11 in Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization in the prior year,
Adjusted Diluted EPS of $4.94 in 2016 increased $0.23.

Global revenue of $3,604.2 million in 2016 increased $119.7 million, or 3%, compared to 2015 and reflected good growth in
MA revenue, which included revenue from the first quarter 2016 acquisition of GGY, coupled with modest growth in MIS revenue.

The $36.6 million increase in MIS
revenue reflected robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as for public finance related activity in the second half of 2016 reflecting both opportunistic refinancing and new issuance activity. The growth
also reflected benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were mostly offset by challenges in the first half of 2016 in the high-yield and investment-grade corporate debt sectors due to
elevated credit spreads and market volatility. Additionally, there was lower securitization activity in the U.S. in the first half of 2016, most nota-

bly in the U.S. CLO and CMBS asset classes, which reflected the aforementioned elevated credit spreads and market volatility as well as uncertainty earlier in the year relating to the
implementation of certain risk retention regulatory requirements by the end of 2016 for these asset classes.

The $83.1 million increase in MA revenue reflects
growth in ERS and RD&A, most notably in the U.S. Revenue grew in most product areas of ERS and included revenue from the 2016 acquisition of GGY. In RD&A, revenue growth was primarily driven by credit research, subscriptions and licensing of
ratings data partially offset by the impact of unfavorable changes in FX rates. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, MA revenue grew 10%.

Transaction revenue accounted for 49% of global MCO revenue in 2016 compared 50% of global MCO revenue in 2015.

U.S. revenue of $2,105.5 million in 2016 increased $96.5 million over the prior year, reflecting strong growth in MA coupled with modest growth in MIS.

Non-U.S.

revenue increased $23.2 million from 2015 reflecting modest growth in both reportable segments.

Operating expenses were $1,026.6 million in 2016 up $50.3 million from 2015 and included an increase in compensation costs of approximately $71 million.
This increase reflects higher salaries and employee benefit expenses resulting from the impact of annual compensation increases and headcount growth in MA which includes headcount from the acquisition of GGY. The increase in compensation expenses
also reflects higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement relative to targeted results compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by an approximate $21 million decrease in

non-compensation

expenses reflecting cost reduction initiatives in response to challenging business conditions in MIS earlier in the year.

SG&A expenses of $936.4 million in 2016 increased $15.1 million from the prior year period reflecting increased compensation costs primarily due to annual
compensation increases company-wide and headcount growth in MA which included headcount from the GGY acquisition. The increase in compensation expenses also reflects higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement relative to targeted
results compared to the prior year. Additionally, there was an increase in

non-compensation

expenses reflecting higher rent and occupancy costs being mostly offset by the impact of cost reduction initiatives
in response to challenging business conditions in MIS earlier in the year.

The restructuring charge of $12.0 million relates to cost management initiatives in
2016 in the MIS segment as well as in certain corporate overhead functions.

D&A increased $13.2 million reflecting amortization of intangible assets from
acquisitions as well as higher depreciation reflecting an increase in capital expenditures to support IT infrastructure and business growth.

The $863.8 million
Settlement Charge relates to an agreement with the U.S. DOJ and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia to resolve pending and potential civil claims related to the MIS segment.

Operating income of $638.7 million in 2016, which included the aforementioned $863.8 million Settlement Charge, was down $834.7 million compared to 2015
and resulted in an operating margin of 17.7%, compared to 42.3% in the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income of $1,641.2 million in 2016 was up modestly compared to 2015, while Adjusted Operating Margin of 45.5% remained flat compared to 2015.

Interest expense, net in 2016 was ($137.8) million, a $22.7 million increase in expense compared to 2015 reflecting interest on the 2015 Senior Notes which were
issued in March 2015 as well as interest on the $300 million of additional borrowings under the 2014 Senior Notes

(30-Year)

in November 2015.

Other

non-operating

income, net was $57.1 million in 2016, a $35.8 million increase in income compared to 2015. This
increase reflected FX gains of approximately $35 million related to the substantial liquidation of a subsidiary and approximately $15 million of gains relating to the appreciation of the euro relative to the British pound during 2016. FX
gains in 2015 were immaterial. This increase in income was partially offset by a $6.4 million benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter in 2015 compared to a $1.6 million benefit in 2016.

The ETR was 50.6% in 2016 compared to 31.2% in the prior year with the increase primarily reflecting the

non-deductible

nature of
the federal portion of the aforementioned Settlement Charge.

Net Income in 2016, which included an approximate $701 million net Settlement Charge more fully
described above, was $266.6 million, or $674.7 million lower than prior year. Diluted EPS of $1.36 in 2016, which included: i) a $3.59 Settlement Charge; ii) a $0.04 restructuring charge and iii) an $0.18 FX gain relating to the
substantial liquidation of a subsidiary; and iv) $0.13 in Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization, decreased $3.27 compared to 2015. Excluding all of the aforementioned items in 2016 and a $0.03 benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter and $0.11 in
Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization in the prior year, Adjusted Diluted EPS of $4.94 in 2016 increased $0.23 primarily reflecting lower diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding
reflects share repurchases under the Company’s Board authorized share repurchase program partially offset by shares issued under the employee stock-based compensation programs.

The following is a discussion of external MIS revenue and operating expenses:

Global MIS revenue of $2,370.8 million in 2016 was up 2% compared to 2015 reflecting robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt, bank loans and
public finance in the second half of 2016 as capital market volatility and elevated credit spreads that hindered issuance in the first half of 2016 subsided. Additionally, the growth reflects the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type,
new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were mostly offset by challenges in the first half of 2016 in both the speculative-grade and investment-grade corporate debt sectors due to elevated credit spreads and market volatility at
the time coupled with an unfavorable shift in issuance mix for investment-grade corporate debt. Additionally, there was lower securitization activity in the U.S. in the first half of 2016, primarily in the U.S. CLO and CMBS asset classes, which
reflected the aforementioned elevated credit spreads and market volatility as well as uncertainty earlier in the year relating to the December 2016 implementation deadline for certain risk retention regulatory requirements for these asset classes.

Transaction revenue for MIS was 61% in both 2016 and 2015.

In the U.S., revenue
was $1,501.9 million in 2016, an increase of $27.6 million compared to 2015 and reflected benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases coupled with second half of 2016 growth in rated issuance
volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as strong public finance issuance. These increases were partially offset by lower rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt in the first half of 2016 and a decline in
investment-grade corporate debt rated issuance volumes which was most notable in the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, there were declines in securitization activity in the CLO and CMBS asset classes within SFG in the first half of 2016.

Non-U.S.

revenue was $868.9 million in 2016, an increase of $9.0 million compared to 2015 primarily reflecting second
half of 2016 growth in high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as investment-grade corporate debt. This growth in the second half reflected improved market sentiment following volatility in the first half of 2016 as well as the ECB
sponsored CSPP providing a ballast to corporate debt issuance in the EMEA region. The growth over the prior year also reflects changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were partially offset by lower
revenue in the first half of 2016 primarily reflecting declines in investment-grade and high-yield corporate debt across all regions.


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


Global CFG revenue of $1,122.3 million in 2016 was up 1% compared to 2015. The increase reflects benefits from changes
in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases coupled with robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans in the U.S. and EMEA in the second half of 2016 as capital market volatility and elevated
credit spreads that hindered issuance in the first half of 2016 subsided. The increase also reflects higher investment-grade rated issuance volumes in EMEA in the second half of 2016 reflecting additional liquidity in the region resulting from the
ECB sponsored CSPP. These increases were partially offset by lower rated issuance volumes in the first half of 2016 for investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate debt across all regions due to elevated credit spreads and capital market
volatility at the time. Also, there were lower U.S. investment-grade rated issuance volumes in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflecting an increase in benchmark interest rates immediately following the U.S. presidential election in November.
Transaction revenue represented 68% of total CFG revenue in 2016, compared to 69% in the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue in 2016 was $762.9 million, or $10.0 million higher than the prior year. Internationally, revenue of
$359.4 million in the 2016 was flat compared to the prior year.

Global SFG revenue of $436.8 million in 2016 decreased $12.3 million, or 3%, compared
to 2015. In the U.S., revenue of $293.3 million decreased $18.2 million compared to 2015. This decrease primarily reflected lower CLO formation in the first half of 2016 due to elevated credit spreads and declining availability of
collateral for these instruments earlier in the year. Additionally, the decrease reflected lower securitization activity in the CMBS asset class reflecting higher average credit spreads over the course of 2016, particularly in the first quarter, as
well as uncertainties relating to the implementation of certain risk retention regulatory requirements for this asset class. These declines were partially offset by benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing
increases.

Non-U.S.

revenue in 2016 of $143.5 million increased $5.9 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth in RMBS and ABS in EMEA. Transaction revenue was 62% of total SFG
revenue in 2016 compared to 64% in the prior year.

Global FIG revenue of $368.9 million in 2016 increased $3.3 million, or 1%, compared to 2015. In the
U.S., revenue of $160.1 million increased $3.7 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as higher M&A related issuance
volumes in the insurance sector. These increases were partially offset by reduced banking-related issuance volumes due to market volatility in the first half of 2016. Internationally, revenue was $208.8 million in 2016, or flat compared to 2015
with benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases and growth in the Asia-Pacific region reflecting higher cross-border issuance from Chinese banks and asset managers being offset by declines in
banking-related issuance in EMEA. Transaction revenue was 37% of total FIG revenue in both 2016 and 2015.

Global PPIF revenue was $412.2 million in 2016 and
increased $35.8 million, or 10%, compared to 2015. In the U.S., revenue in 2016 was $276.2 million and increased $31.5 million compared to 2015 primarily due to benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and
pricing increases as well as strong growth in public finance issuance in the second half of 2016. This growth in issuance reflects opportunistic refunding activity amidst favorable market conditions as well as higher new issuance volumes to fund
municipal infrastructure investment needs. Additionally, the growth in the U.S. reflects higher infrastructure finance revenue. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue was $136.0 million and increased $4.3 million compared to 2015 reflecting
benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as higher infrastructure finance revenue in the Americas region. These increases were partially offset by lower project finance revenue across all

non-U.S.

regions. Transaction revenue was 63% of total PPIF revenue in 2016 compared to 60% in the prior year.

Global MIS Other
revenue of $30.6 million in 2016 was flat compared to 2015.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2016 decreased $5.1 million compared to 2015 primarily
reflecting lower

non-compensation

costs of approximately $25.0 million reflecting overall cost control initiatives. This decrease was partially offset by higher compensation expenses of approximately
$20 million compared to the prior year reflecting annual salary increases coupled with higher incentive compensation costs resulting from higher achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year.

The increase in D&A compared to the prior year reflects capital expenditures related to investments in the Company’s IT and operational infrastructure.

The restructuring charge in 2016 relates to cost management initiatives in the MIS segment as well as in certain corporate overhead functions.

The Settlement Charge is pursuant to an agreement with the DOJ and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

Adjusted Operating Income was $1,355.4 million and increased $48.0 million compared to the prior year. Operating income in 2016, which includes the
aforementioned $863.8 million Settlement Charge, was $407.6 million and decreased $833.8 million compared to the prior year. Adjusted Operating Margin was 54.9% or 100 BPS higher than the prior year. Operating margin was 16.5% in 2016
compared to 51.1% in the prior year, with the decline primarily due to the aforementioned Settlement Charge. Adjusted Operating Income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.

The following is a discussion of external MA revenue and operating expenses:

Global MA revenue increased $83.1 million, or 7%, compared to 2015 and reflected growth in RD&A as well as ERS, which included revenue from the acquisition of
GGY. Additionally, the growth over the prior year reflects benefits from pricing increases within MA’s recurring revenue base. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX rates, MA revenue grew 10% compared to the prior year. Recurring revenue
comprised 75% and 74% of total MA revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

In the U.S., revenue of $603.6 million in 2016 increased $68.9 million, and
reflected growth in RD&A and ERS. The growth in RD&A reflected strength in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data as well as higher revenue within SAV and ECCA. The increase in ERS revenue reflected growth across all
product verticals and included revenue from the acquisition of GGY in March 2016.

Non-U.S.

revenue of $629.8 million in
2016 was $14.2 million higher than in 2015 reflecting growth in RD&A and ERS partially offset by unfavorable changes in FX rates. The growth in RD&A primarily reflects strength in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings
data in the Asia-Pacific region. The increase in ERS was primarily due to higher revenue from the Assets Liability & Capital and Credit Assessment & Origination product verticals in the EMEA region coupled with revenue from the
acquisition of GGY. These increases were partially offset by declines in the Credit Assessment & Origination product vertical in the Americas region.

Global
RD&A revenue of $667.6 million, which comprised 54% of total external MA revenue in both 2016 and 2015, increased $41.2 million, or 7%, over the prior year period. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX rates, RD&A revenue increased
9% over the prior year. The growth reflected strength in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data as well as higher revenue within SAV and ECCA. The growth compared to 2015 also reflects the benefits of pricing increases. In the
U.S., revenue of $389.3 million increased $37.4 million compared to 2015.

Non-U.S.

revenue of $278.3 million increased $3.8 million compared to the prior year.

Global ERS revenue of $418.8 million in 2016 increased $44.8 million, or 12%, over 2015. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX rates, ERS revenue grew 15%
reflecting increases across most product offerings and included revenue from the acquisition of GGY in March of 2016. Additionally, the revenue growth reflects benefits from pricing increases within ERS’s recurring revenue base. Revenue in ERS
is subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of software implementation and license revenue in a relatively small number of engagements. In the U.S., revenue of $162.9 million
increased $31.7 million compared to the prior year.

Non-U.S.

revenue of $255.9 million increased $13.1 million compared to the prior year.

Global PS revenue of $147.0 million in 2016 decreased $2.9 million, or 2%, from 2015. Excluding the unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates, PS
revenue was flat compared to the prior year. In the U.S. and internationally revenue was $51.4 million and $95.6 million, respectively, or flat and down 3%, respectively.


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


The increase in D&A compared to the prior year reflects capital expenditures related to investments in the
Company’s IT and operational infrastructure as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2016 increased
$70.5 million compared to 2015. The expense growth primarily reflects an approximate $68 million increase in compensation costs primarily due to higher headcount to support business growth as well as headcount from the acquisition of GGY
coupled with annual merit increases.

Adjusted Operating Income was $285.8 million in 2016 and increased $6.3 million compared to the same period in 2015.
Operating income of $231.1 million in 2016 decreased $0.9 million compared to the same period in 2015. Adjusted Operating Margin in 2016 was 22.9%, down 110bps from 2015. Operating margin was 18.5% in 2016, down 140bps from the prior year.
Operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin in 2016 were suppressed due to a larger proportion of overhead costs allocated to MA under the Company’s revenue-split methodology. Adjusted operating income and operating income both include
intersegment revenue and expense.

MARKET RISK

Foreign exchange risk:

Moody’s maintains a presence in 40 countries
outside the U.S. In 2017, approximately 40% and 39% of both the Company’s revenue and expenses, respectively were denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally in the British pound and the euro. As such, the
Company is exposed to market risk from changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 81% of Moody’s assets were located outside the U.S. making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in FX rates. The effects of translating
assets and liabilities of

non-U.S.

operations with

non-U.S.

functional currencies to the U.S. dollar are charged or credited to OCI.

The effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other

non-operating

income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on
certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency. The following table shows the impact to the fair value of the forward contracts if foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar:

*

Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form

10-K

for further detail on the forward contracts.

The change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by FX revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency.

Also, the Company has designated

€

500 million of the 2015 Senior Notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate FX exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries. If the euro were to strengthen 10%
relative to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $56 million unfavorable adjustment to OCI related to this net investment hedge. This adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the Company’s euro net
investment in subsidiaries.

Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short- term investments of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 included
$1 billion located outside the U.S. Approximately 62% of the Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at December 31, 2017 were held in currencies other than USD. As such, a decrease in the value of
foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the euro and GBP, could reduce the reported amount of USD cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Credit and Interest rate risk:

The Company’s interest rate risk management
objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. Moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on
changes in interest rates. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed rate of interest on certain of its borrowings to a floating rate based on the

3-month

LIBOR. These swaps
are adjusted to fair market value

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing, while net interest payments
are recorded as interest expense/income in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. A hypothetical change of 100bps in the LIBOR-based swap rate would result in an approximate $26 million change to the fair value of these
interest rate swaps.

Additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of
this Form

10-K.

Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high-quality investment-grade securities within and
outside the U.S. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit
and issuers of high-grade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit.

measure and is defined by the Company as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for capital expenditures. Refer to

“Non-GAAP

Financial Measures” of this MD&A for further information on this financial measure.

Net
cash provided by operating activities

Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:

Net cash flows from operating activities decreased $511.7 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the approximate $701 million net payment for the
Settlement Charge in 2017 (net of an approximate $163 million tax benefit relating to the charge). This was partially offset by an increase in cash flows primarily relating to the Company’s strong Adjusted Net Income growth in 2017.

Additionally, the Company made approximately $26 million and $22 million in contributions to its funded U.S. pension plan in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015:

Net cash flows from operating activities increased $61.1 million compared to the prior year primarily due to:

»

an approximate $64 million increase due to the timing of income tax payments;

»

an approximate $43 million increase relating to higher deferred revenue reflecting overall business growth;

»

an approximate $43 million increase reflecting higher incentive compensation payouts in 2015 compared to 2016 as well as higher incentive compensation accruals reflecting greater achievement against full-year
targeted results in 2016 compared to 2015

partially

offset by:

»

approximate $79 million decrease in cash flow from changes in accounts receivable balances primarily reflecting greater growth in accounts receivable in 2016 compared to 2015. Approximately 30% and 33% of the
Company’s accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represent unbilled receivables which primarily reflect certain annual fees in MIS which are billed in arrears.

Additionally, the Company made approximately $22 million to its funded U.S. pension plan in both 2016 and 2015.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities

Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:

The $3,522.0 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities compared to 2016 primarily reflects:

»

a $3.4 billion increase in cash paid for acquisitions compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk in the third quarter of 2017;

»

lower net maturities of short-term investments of $251.2 million;

Partially offset by:

»

cash received of $111.1 million relating to the Purchase Price Hedge.

Year ended December 31, 2016 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2015:

The $194.0 million increase in cash flows provided by investing activities compared to 2015 primarily reflects:

»

higher net maturities of short-term investments of $354.7 million;

Partially offset by:

»

a $73.2 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions and equity investments primarily due to the acquisition of GGY in 2016;

»

net cash paid of $23.1 million for the settlement of forward contracts designated as net investment hedges in 2016 compared to cash received of $39.7 million in 2015; and

»

higher capital expenditures of approximately $26 million reflecting investment in the Company’s IT and operational infrastructure.

Net cash provided by financing activities

Year ended
December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:

The $2,650.1 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was
primarily attributed to:

»

proceeds of $1.5 billion from notes and a term loan issued as well as $0.1 billion in net proceeds from commercial paper to fund the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk. Additionally, reflects $0.8 billion of

interest of KIS and additional shares of KIS Pricing;

partially offset by:

»

treasury shares repurchased of $738.8 million in 2016 compared to $1,098.1 million repurchased in 2015.

Cash and short-term investments held in

non-U.S.

jurisdictions

The Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 included approximately $1 billion
located outside of the U.S. Approximately 27% of the Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is denominated in euros and British pounds. The Company manages both its U.S. and international cash flow to maintain
sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs.

Other Material Future Cash Requirements

The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow in 2018. Cash requirements
for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources.

The Company remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by investing in growing areas of the business, reinvesting in ratings quality
initiatives, making selective acquisitions, repurchasing stock and paying a dividend, all in a manner consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity after giving effect to any additional indebtedness that may be incurred.

In January 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share of Moody’s common stock, payable March 12, 2018 to
shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2018. The continued payment of dividends

at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board. In December 2015, the Board authorized $1.0 billion of share repurchase authority, which had a remaining repurchase
authority of approximately $0.5 million at December 31, 2017. Full-year 2018 total share repurchases are expected to be approximately $200 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation
decisions.

The Company has future cash requirements, including operating leases and debt service and principal payments, as noted in the tables that follow as well
as future payments related to the transition tax under the Tax Act:

Indebtedness

At December 31, 2017, Moody’s had $5.5 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $0.9 billion of additional capacity available under the
Company’s CP program which is backstopped by the 2015 Facility as more fully discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the
debt agreements. All of the Company’s long-term debt agreements contain cross default provisions which state that default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare
borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2017, there were no such cross defaults.

The repayment
schedule for the Company’s borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2017 is as follows:

Management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share
repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs.

Off-Balance

Sheet
Arrangements

At December 31, 2017, Moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities
often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moody’s is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating

arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.

The table above does not include the Company’s net long-term tax liabilities of $389.1 million relating to UTPs, since the expected cash outflow of such amounts by period cannot be reasonably estimated.
Additionally, the table above does not include approximately $247 million relating to the deemed repatriation liability resulting from the Tax Act enacted into law in the U.S. in December 2017.

Non-GAAP

Financial Measures:

In
addition to its reported results, Moody’s has included in this MD&A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as

“non-GAAP

financial measures.” Management believes that such

non-GAAP

financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing

period-to-period

comparisons of the Company’s performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used
by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These

non-GAAP

measures, as defined by the Company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. Furthermore,
these

non-GAAP

measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other GAAP measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the Company. Below are descriptions of the
Company’s

non-GAAP

financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the

non-GAAP

measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure:

Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin:

The Company
presents Adjusted Operating Income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of Moody’s. Adjusted Operating Income excludes depreciation and amortization, Acquisition-Related Expenses,
restructuring and the Settlement Charge. Depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets. Acquisition-Related Expenses
consist of expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk and are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the
multi-year integration effort. Acquisition related expenses from previous acquisitions were not material. Restructuring charges are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies. The Settlement
Charge is a material

non-recurring

event that is not expected to recur in the future at this magnitude. Management believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, Acquisition-Related Expenses,
restructuring and the Settlement Charge, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the Company’s operating results from period to period and across companies. The Company defines Adjusted Operating Margin
as Adjusted Operating Income divided by revenue.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS attributable to Moody’s common shareholders:

Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, the Company modified this adjusted measure to exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies
utilize intangible assets with different ages and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated
to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies. Also, management believes that excluding acquisition-related amortization
expense provides additional perspective when comparing operating results from period to period, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. Furthermore, U.S. tax reform as well as changes in statutory tax rates in Belgium were both
enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in significant adjustments to the tax provision. The Company modified the adjusted measures to exclude these adjustments to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted EPS
from period to period and across companies. In addition to excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the effects of U.S. tax reform as well as the statutory tax rate change in Belgium, current and prior-year adjusted net income and
adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the CCXI Gain, the Purchase Price Hedge Gain, Acquisition-Related Expenses, restructuring charges and the Settlement Charge. The Company excludes these items to provide additional perspective on the
Company’s operating results from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods. Additionally, the Acquisition-Related Expenses are excluded due to the material nature
of these expenses which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multi-year integration effort relating to Bureau van Dijk. Acquisition-Related Expenses from previous acquisitions were not material.

Free Cash Flow

:

The
Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is a useful metric in assessing the Company’s cash flows to service debt, pay dividends
and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Management deems capital expenditures essential to the Company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of Moody’s operational capabilities. Accordingly, capital expenditures are
deemed to be a recurring use of Moody’s cash flow. Below is a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flows from operating activities to Free Cash Flow:

exposure to potential criminal sanctions or civil remedies if the Company fails to comply with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including sanctions laws, anti-corruption
laws, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials; the impact of mergers, acquisitions or other business combinations and the ability of the Company to successfully integrate acquired businesses; currency and foreign exchange
volatility; the level of future cash flows; the levels of capital investments; and a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions. Other factors, risks and uncertainties relating to our acquisition of Bureau van
Dijk could cause our actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, including risks relating to the integration of Bureau van Dijk’s operations, products and employees into Moody’s
and the possibility that anticipated synergies and other benefits of the acquisition will not be realized in the amounts anticipated or will not be realized within the expected timeframe; risks that the acquisition could have an adverse effect on
the business of Bureau van Dijk or its prospects, including, without limitation, on relationships with vendors, suppliers or customers; claims made, from time to time, by vendors, suppliers or customers; changes in the European or global
marketplaces that have an adverse effect on the business of Bureau van Dijk. These factors, risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moody’s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated,

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Moody’s Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the SEC in Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Moody’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Moody’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company has undertaken an assessment of the design and operational effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2017 based on criteria established in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 did not include the internal controls
of Bureau van Dijk, which was acquired during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and will be included in our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2018. The total assets (excluding acquired goodwill and intangible assets which are included within the scope of this assessment) and revenues of Bureau van Dijk represents approximately $322 million and $92 million,
respectively, of the corresponding amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.

Based on the assessment
performed, management has concluded that Moody’s maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.

The effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Shareholders and Board of Directors of Moody’s Corporation:

Opinions on
the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Moody’s
Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The Company acquired Bureau Van Dijk in August 2017, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, Bureau Van Dijk’s internal control over financial reporting, which is associated with total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles which are included within the scope of the assessment) of
$322 million and total revenues of $92 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also
excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Bureau Van Dijk.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MOODY’S CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(tabular dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share data)

NOTE 1

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings;
(ii) credit, capital markets and economic research, data and analytical tools; (iii) software solutions that support financial risk management activities; (iv) quantitatively derived credit scores; (v) financial services training and
certification services; (vi) offshore financial research and analytical services; and (vii) company information and business intelligence products. Moody’s reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA.

MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is
primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain

non-ratings-related

operations which consist primarily of financial instrument pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA’s

non-ratings

operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global
financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including

in-depth

research on major debt issuers, industry studies and
commentary on topical credit-related events. The RD&A business also produces economic research and data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores as well as business intelligence and company information products. Within its
ERS business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. The PS business provides offshore analytical and research services along with financial training and certification programs.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current presentation.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

In the first quarter of 2017, the Company
adopted ASU

No. 2016-09

“Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”. As required by ASU

2016-09,

Excess Tax Benefits or shortfalls
recognized on stock-based compensation are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes on a prospective basis. Prior to the adoption of this ASU, Excess Tax Benefits and shortfalls were
recorded to capital surplus within shareholders’ deficit. The impact of this adoption was a $39.5 million benefit to the provision for income taxes for the year end December 31, 2017.

Additionally, in accordance with this ASU, Excess Tax Benefits or shortfalls recognized on stock-based compensation are classified as operating cash flows in the
consolidated statement of cash flows, and the Company has applied this provision on a retrospective basis. Under previous accounting guidance, the Excess Tax Benefits or shortfalls were shown as a reduction to operating activity and an increase to
financing activity. Furthermore, the Company has elected to continue to estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest, rather than accounting for award forfeitures as they occur, to determine the amount of stock-based compensation cost
recognized in each period. The impact to the Company’s statement of cash flows for prior year relating to the adoption of this provision of the ASU is set forth in the table below:

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include those of Moody’s Corporation and its majority- and wholly-owned subsidiaries. The effects of all intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies for which the Company has significant influ-

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



ence over operating and financial policies but not a controlling interest are accounted for on an equity basis whereby the Company records its proportional share of the investment’s net
income or loss as part of other

non-operating

income (expense), net and any dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment. The Company applies the guidelines set forth in Topic 810 of the ASC
in assessing its interests in variable interest entities to decide whether to consolidate that entity. The Company has reviewed the potential variable interest entities and determined that there are no consolidation requirements under Topic 810 of
the ASC. The Company consolidates its ICRA subsidiaries on a three month lag.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents principally consist of investments in money market mutual funds and money market deposit accounts as well as high-grade commercial paper and certificates
of deposit with maturities of three months or less when purchased.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments are securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase that are available for operations in the next 12 months. The
Company’s short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and their cost approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. Interest and dividends on these investments are recorded into income when
earned.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost
and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not extend the economic useful life of the related assets are charged to expense as incurred.

Research and Development Costs

All research and development costs are expensed
as incurred. These costs primarily reflect the development of credit processing software and quantitative credit risk assessment products sold by the MA segment.

Research and development costs were $42.0 million, $40.1 million, and $29.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and are included in operating expenses within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. These costs generally consist of professional services provided by third parties and compensation costs of employees.

Costs for internally developed computer software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established.
These costs primarily relate to the development or enhancement of products in the ERS business and generally consist of professional services provided by third parties and compensation costs of employees that develop the software. Judgment is
required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and the Company believes that technological feasibility for its software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding
and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to customers. Accordingly, costs for internally developed computer software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed that were eligible for capitalization under
Topic 985 of the ASC were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

The Company capitalizes costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use. These assets, included in property and equipment in the consolidated balance
sheets, relate to the Company’s financial, website and other systems. Such costs generally consist of direct costs for third-party license fees, professional services provided by third parties and employee compensation, in each case incurred
either during the application development stage or in connection with upgrades and enhancements that increase functionality. Such costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Costs incurred during the preliminary
project stage of development as well as maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, annually
as of July 31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with ASC Topic 350.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a

two-step

impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its
carrying amount. If a determination is made that, based on the qualitative factors, an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the
reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the
Company will recognize the difference as an impairment charge.

The Company evaluates its reporting units for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if
there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions or realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment. For the reporting units


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


where the Company is consistently able to conclude that an impairment does not exist using only a qualitative approach, the Company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the
aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years. Goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units, and is based on which reporting unit
is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.

For purposes of assessing the recoverability of goodwill, the Company has seven primary reporting units
at December 31, 2017: two within the Company’s ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody’s other ratings operations) and five reporting units within MA: RD&A, ERS, FSTC, MAKS and Bureau van
Dijk. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process,

in-depth

research on major debt issuers, industry studies,
economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The ERS reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software that is sold on a license or subscription basis as well as related advisory services for
implementation and maintenance. The FSTC reporting unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and certification services. The MAKS reporting unit consists of
offshore research and analytical services. The Bureau van Dijk reporting unit consists of business intelligence and company information products.

Amortizable
intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Rent
Expense

The Company records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. In cases where there is a free rent period or future fixed rent
escalations the Company will record a deferred rent liability. Additionally, the receipt of any lease incentives will be recorded as a deferred rent liability which will be amortized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records compensation expense for all
share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under stock option and restricted stock plans. The accounting for Excess Tax Benefits or
shortfalls on stock-based compensation is more fully discussed in Note 1.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Based on the Company’s risk management policy, from time to time the Company may use derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to changes in foreign
exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The changes in the
value of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are recorded with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the item being hedged. Changes in the derivative’s fair value that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded to other
comprehensive income or loss, to the extent the hedge is effective, and such amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income.
Changes in the derivative’s fair value that qualify as net investment hedges are recorded to other comprehensive income or loss, to the extent the hedge is effective. Any changes in the fair value of derivatives that the Company does not
designate as hedging instruments under Topic 815 of the ASC are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they occur.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the
customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.

Pursuant to ASC Topic 605, when a sales
arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not
available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

The Company’s products and services will generally qualify as separate units of
accounting under ASC Topic 605. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the
customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. In instances
where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.

The
Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the VSOE criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or, if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately, the price established by
management having the relevant authority to establish such a price. In instances where the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each
element separately, not selling products

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



within a reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history, the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating
largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in its market strategy from that of its
peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company
generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASC Topic 605, when the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which
the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives,
standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions
such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.

In the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer. Revenue attributed to monitoring
of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, structured credit, international residential mortgage-backed and
asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities, which was approximately 24 years on a
weighted average basis at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $140.1 million, $133.0 million, and $121.0 million, respectively.

Multiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. In instances where monitoring
fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The Company generally uses ESP in
determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely provides initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings.

MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding.
Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
accounts receivable included approximately $27.0 million, $25.0 million, and $24.0 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue
and the actual billings. Furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period. At December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015,
accounts receivable included approximately $185.0 million, $159.1 million, and $146.4 million, respectively, relating to accrued annual monitoring service revenue.

In the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from
subscription-based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from
sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the
product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are
performed. A large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.

Products and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element arrangement
includes software and

non-software

deliverables, revenue is allocated to the

non-software

deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative
selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.

If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each
software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to determine VSOE for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the residual revenue
to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an undelivered element, the Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been
determined for the undelivered elements. In cases where software implementation services are considered essential and VSOE of fair value exists for post-contract customer support (“PCS”), once the delivery criteria has been met on the
standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a

percentage-of-completion

basis as implementation services are performed, while PCS is recognized


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


over the coverage period. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for PCS, once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin
basis until essential services are complete, at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining PCS coverage period. If VSOE does not exist for PCS at the beginning of an arrangement but is established
during implementation, revenue not recognized due to the absence of VSOE will be recognized on a cumulative basis.

Accounts Receivable Allowances

Moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions.
Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual billing
adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are recorded against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of
customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody’s adjusts its allowance as
considered appropriate in the circumstances.

Contingencies

Moody’s is
involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s
is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s
discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

For claims, litigation and
proceedings and governmental investigations and inquires not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the
consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better
estimate than another amount within the range. In other instances, where a loss is reasonably possible, management may not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, but discloses
the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory,
governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the
Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on
its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to
predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law
asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.

The
Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the Company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation, employment practices litigation and employee medical claims and terrorism, for which
the claims are not material to the Company. In addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the Company for defense costs related to professional liability claims. For matters insured by the Company’s insurance
subsidiary, Moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion. The Company determines liabilities based on an assessment of
management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates. Defense costs for matters not self-insured by the Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are
provided.

For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is

more-likely-than-not

(defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine
the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this

more-likely-than-not

threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater
than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses include costs associated with the development and production of the Company’s products and services and their delivery to customers. These
expenses principally include employee compensation and benefits and travel costs that are incurred in

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



connection with these activities. Operating expenses are charged to income as incurred, except for certain costs related to software implementation services which may be deferred until related
revenue is recognized. Additionally, certain costs incurred to develop internal use software are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses include such
items as compensation and benefits for corporate officers and staff and compensation and other expenses related to sales. They also include items such as office rent, business insurance, professional fees and gains and losses from sales and
disposals of assets. SG&A expenses are charged to income as incurred, except for certain expenses incurred to develop internal use software (which are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life) and the deferral of sales
commissions in the MA segment (which are recognized in the period in which the related revenue is recognized).

Foreign Currency Translation

For all operations outside the U.S. where the Company has designated the local currency as the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S.
dollars using end of year exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the year. For these foreign operations, currency translation adjustments are recorded to other comprehensive income.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income represents the change in net assets
of a business enterprise during a period due to transactions and other events and circumstances from

non-owner

sources including foreign currency translation impacts, net actuarial losses and net prior service
costs related to pension and other retirement plans, gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges or cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on securities designated as

‘available-for-sale’

under Topic 320 of the ASC. Comprehensive income items, including cumulative translation adjustments of entities that are less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be
reclassified to noncontrolling interests and thereby, adjusting accumulated other comprehensive income proportionately in accordance with the percentage of ownership interest of the NCI shareholder.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that
are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. On January 1, 2017, the Company adopted ASU

No. 2016-16,

“ Accounting for Income
Taxes, Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory. Under previous guidance, the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers (intercompany sales) were deferred until the transferred asset was sold to a third party or otherwise
recovered through use. The new guidance eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sales of assets other than inventory. Upon adoption, a $4.6 million cumulative-effect adjustment was recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the
period of adoption.

The Company classifies interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense in its consolidated statements of
operations. Penalties are recognized in other

non-operating

expenses. For uncertain tax positions (“UTPs”), the Company first determines whether it is

more-likely-than-not

(defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will
examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this

more-likely-than-not

threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is
greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law,
resulting in all previously undistributed foreign earnings being subject to U.S. tax. However, the Company currently intends to continue to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The Company has not provided non-U.S. deferred income
taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. It is not practicable to determine the amount of non-U.S. deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future, due to complexities in the tax laws and
in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, all of which are short-term in nature and, accordingly,
approximate fair value. Additionally, the Company invests in certain short-term investments consisting primarily of certificates of deposit that are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.

The Company also has certain investments in closed-ended and open-ended mutual funds in India which are designated as ‘available for sale’ under Topic 320 of
the ASC. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income and are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to the statement of operations when the investment matures or is
sold using a specific identification method.

Also, the Company uses derivative instruments, as further described in Note 5, to manage certain financial exposures
that occur in the normal course of business. These derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


Fair value is defined by the ASC as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability
(i.e., an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The determination of this fair value is based on the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company could commence transactions and
considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. Also, determination of fair value assumes that market participants will consider
the highest and best use of the asset.

The ASC establishes a fair value hierarchy whereby the inputs contained in valuation techniques used to measure fair value are
categorized into three broad levels as follows:

Level

1: quoted market prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at
the date of the fair value measurement;

Level

2: inputs other than quoted market prices described in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or
can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities;

Level

3: unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value measurement of the assets or liabilities.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, trade receivables and derivatives.

The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual
funds, money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposits and high-grade commercial paper. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company manages its credit risk exposure
on cash equivalents and short-term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single entity. No customer accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 or 2016.

Earnings (Loss) per Share of Common Stock

Basic shares outstanding is
calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, assuming that such shares were
outstanding and dilutive during the reporting period.

Pension and Other Retirement Benefits

Moody’s maintains various noncontributory DBPPs as well as other contributory and noncontributory retirement plans. The expense and assets/liabilities that the
Company reports for its pension and other retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions represent the Company’s best estimates and may vary by plan. The
differences between the assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and actual experience is spread over a five-year period to the market-related value of plan assets which is used in determining the expected return on
assets component of annual pension expense. All other actuarial gains and losses are generally deferred and amortized over the estimated average future working life of active plan participants.

The Company recognizes as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheet the funded status of its defined benefit retirement plans, measured on a

plan-by-plan

basis. Changes in the funded status due to actuarial gains/losses are recorded as part of other comprehensive income during the period the changes occur.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, income taxes, contingencies, valuation and useful lives of long-lived
and intangible assets, goodwill, pension and other retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, and depreciable lives for property and equipment and computer software.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue

from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”. This ASU outlines a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services by performing a five-step process. In August 2015, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2015-14 “Revenue

from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Deferral of

MOODY’S

the Effective Date” which defers the effective date of the ASU for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted up to the
original effective date of December 15, 2016. In addition, during 2016, the FASB issued additional updates clarifying the implementation guidance for the new revenue recognition standard.

The Company will adopt the new revenue guidance as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this adoption method, the Company
will record a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2018 and apply the provisions of the ASU prospectively. As of the date of this filing, the Company has made a full assessment of the changes to its accounting policies
relating to the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard. This ASU will have an impact on, which is not limited to: i) the accounting for certain software subscription revenue in MA whereby the license rights within the arrangement will be
recognized at the inception of the contract based on estimated stand-alone selling price with the remainder recognized over the subscription period (compared to ASC 605 whereby all software subscription revenue is currently recognized over the
subscription period); ii) the accounting for certain ERS and ESA revenue arrangements where VSOE is not currently available under ASC 605 will result in the acceleration of revenue recognition (compared to ASC 605 whereby revenue is currently
deferred due to lack of VSOE until all elements without VSOE have been delivered); iii) the capitalization and related amortization period for sales commissions, which are incurred in the MA segment; iv) the expensing of software implementation
project costs to fulfill a contract for its ERS and ESA businesses which under ASC 605 were capitalized and expensed when related project revenue was recognized; v) the capitalization of work-in-process costs

for in-progress MIS

ratings at the end of each reporting period; and vi) the timing of when fees for certain MIS ratings products are recognized to match when the performance obligation to the
customer is satisfied and the determination of the transaction price to account for variable consideration at contract inception. This ASU will also require new comprehensive disclosures about contracts with customers including the significant
reasonable judgments the Company has made when applying the ASU.

The Company is in the process of finalizing the implementation of a software solution in order to
support the accounting under the new standard for MA revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations.

Under this adoption method, the Company will record
a cumulative

non-cash

adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2018 and apply the provisions of the ASU prospectively. The table below reflects an approximation of anticipated impacts to
January 1, 2018 retained earnings for each type of adjustment required under the new revenue standard based on the Company’s assessment and best estimates to date.

Represents anticipated deferred revenue as of December 31, 2017 that would have been recognized as revenue in 2017 or earlier if the new standard was then in effect. The transition adjustment will continue to be
refined as the Company finalizes its implementation of the aforementioned software solution.

(2)

Pending finalization of the final fourth quarter MA sales commission payout to be made during the first quarter.

Note
that the above range of expected impacts from adopting the new revenue standard pertains solely to the impact to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and is not indicative of the impact the
new ASU is expected to have on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations post-adoption. The impact that the provisions of the new ASU will have on the consolidated statement of operations subsequent to adoption will depend heavily on
the volume and impact of new sales contracts realized in future periods, particularly in the ERS and ESA businesses. The Company does not have any material software implementation arrangements in progress as of December 31, 2017 with terms
longer than two years, and therefore the impact to the consolidated statement of operations under the provisions of the new standard will be dependent on each future period’s sales activity. Generally, however, the Company does not anticipate
that applying the provisions of the new standard will have a material impact to its 2018 consolidated Net Income. However, there could be quarterly fluctuations in the financial results of both MIS and MA, or there could be increases or decreases in
revenues and expenses which would largely offset and not be material at a total Company level for the full year. Furthermore, as part of the disclosure requirements in the first year of adoption, there will be disclosures of the Company’s
consolidated statement of operations for 2018 as if the new revenue standard was not adopted and the Company continued to account for revenue and related transactions under the existing standards. Importantly, the application of this new guidance
has no effect on the cash the Company expects to receive nor on the economics of the business, but rather affects the timing of revenue and expense recognition with the expectation that revenue recognition will more closely align with cash received.

In January 2016, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2016-01 “Financial

Instruments—Overall

(Subtopic 825-10), Recognition

and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. The amendments in this ASU update various aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosures relating to financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


Company has determined that the most pertinent impact to its financial statements upon the adoption of this ASU will relate to the discontinuance of

the available-for-sale classification

for investments in equity securities (unrealized gains and losses were recorded through OCI). Accordingly, subsequent to adoption of this ASU, changes in the
fair value of equity securities held by the Company will be recorded through earnings. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases

(Topic 842)” requiring lessees to recognize

a right-of-use asset

and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows will
depend on classification as either a finance or operating lease. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. This standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach
whereby leases will be presented in accordance with the new standard as of the earliest period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company’s financial statements. The Company believes that the most
notable impact to its financial statements upon the adoption of this ASU will be the recognition of a

material right-of-use asset

and lease liability for its
real estate leases.

In June 2016, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial

Instruments—Credit
Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”. The amendments in this ASU require the use of an “expected credit loss” impairment model for most financial assets reported at amortized cost which will
require entities to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the instrument. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses.

For available-for-sale debt

securities with unrealized losses, an allowance for credit losses will be recognized as a contra account to the amortized cost
carrying value of the asset rather than a direct reduction to the carrying value, with changes in the allowance impacting earnings. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early
adoption permitted in annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective
reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements. Currently, the Company believes that the most notable impact of this ASU will relate to its processes around the assessment of the adequacy of
its allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable.

In August 2016, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement

of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”. This ASU adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of certain
cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows with the intent to alleviate diversity in practice for classifying various types of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. The Company will apply this clarification guidance in its statements of cash flows upon adoption.

In January 2017, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2017-01, “Business

Combinations (Topic 805), Clarifying the Definition of a Business”. This ASU clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist
entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied
prospectively. Upon adoption, the Company will apply the guidance in this ASU when evaluating whether acquired assets and activities constitute a business.

In March
2017, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement

Benefits (Topic 715), Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit
Cost”. This ASU impacts the presentation of net periodic pension costs in the statement of operations. Entities will be required to report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs (either Operating
or SG&A in Moody’s statement of operations). The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside of operating income. The ASU permits
only the service cost component of net periodic pension cost to be eligible for capitalization, when applicable. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Upon adoption, the Company will
bifurcate its net periodic pension costs reported in its statements of operations in accordance with this ASU.

In May 2017, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2017-09, “Compensation—Stock

Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting”. This ASU clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment
award must be accounted for as modifications. Under this ASU, an entity will not apply modification accounting to a share-based payment award if the award’s fair value, vesting conditions and classification as an equity or liability instrument
are the same immediately before and after the change. The new guidance will reduce diversity in practice and result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as modifications. This ASU is effective for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its financial
statements.

In July 2017, the FASB issued

ASU No. 2017-12, “Derivatives

and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted
Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities”. This ASU enables entities to enhance transparency relating to risk management activities and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain circumstances. This ASU is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



periods within those years with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact that this ASU will have on its financial statements.

In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not
have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to finalize the calculations for the 2017 income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides entities with a one year measurement period
from the December 22, 2017 enactment date, in order to complete the accounting for the effects of the Tax Act. Further information pertaining to the provisional estimates recorded by the Company as of and for the year ended December 31,
2017 are detailed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

In February 2018, FASB issued ASU

2018-02,

“Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”. Under current GAAP, adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities related to a change in tax laws or rates are included in income from continuing
operations, even in situations where the related items were originally recognized in OCI (commonly referred to as a “stranded tax effect”). The provisions of this ASU permit the reclassification of the stranded tax effect related to the
Tax Act from AOCI to retained earnings. This ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of this ASU is to be
applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the Tax Act were recognized. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements.

in the first quarter of 2017. The assumed proceeds in 2016 and 2015 include Excess Tax Benefits.

The decrease in the

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company is exposed to global market risks, including risks from
changes in FX rates and changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the Company uses derivatives in certain instances to manage the aforementioned financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue
derivatives for speculative purposes.

Derivatives and

non-derivative

instruments designated as accounting hedges:

Interest Rate Swaps

The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to
convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its long-term debt to a floating interest rate based on the

3-month

LIBOR. The purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the risk associated with changes in the fair
value of the long-term debt, thus the Company has designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The fair value of the swaps is adjusted quarterly with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the debt. The changes in the fair value of the
swaps and the underlying hedged item generally offset and the net cash settlements on the swaps are recorded each period within interest expense, net in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.

Cross-currency swaps

In conjunction with
the issuance of the 2015 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a cross-currency swap to exchange

€

100 million for U.S. dollars on the date of the settlement of the notes. The purpose of
this cross-currency swap was to mitigate FX risk on the remaining principal balance on the 2015 Senior Notes that initially was not designated as a net investment hedge. Under the terms of the swap, the Company paid the counterparty interest on the
$110.5 million received at 3.945% per annum and the counterparty paid the Company interest on the

€

100 million paid at 1.75% per annum. These interest payments were settled in March of
each year, beginning in 2016, until either the maturity of the cross-currency swap in 2027 or upon early termination at the discretion of the Company. The principal payments on this cross currency swap were to be settled in 2027, concurrent with the
repayment of the 2015 Senior Notes at maturity or upon early termination at the discretion of the Company. In March 2016, the Company designated these cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in fair value subsequent to the
date the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges were recognized in OCI. Gains and losses on the swaps initially recognized in OCI were reclassified to the statement of operations in the period in which changes in the underlying hedged item
affects net income. On December 18, 2017, the Company terminated the cross-currency swap and designated the full

€

500 million principal of the 2015 Senior Notes as a net investment
hedge as discussed below.

Net Investment Hedges

The
Company had entered into foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as net investment hedges which were discontinued during 2017. Additionally, the Company has designated

€

500 million of the 2015 Senior Notes Due 2027 as a net investment hedge. These hedges are intended to mitigate FX exposure related to

non-U.S.

dollar
net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. These net investment hedges are designated as accounting hedges under the applicable sections of Topic 815 of the ASC. The net investment hedge relating to
the 2015 Senior Notes will end upon the repayment of the notes in 2027 unless terminated earlier at the discretion of the Company.

Hedge effectiveness is assessed
based on the overall changes in the fair value of the hedge. For hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, any change in the fair value is recorded in OCI in the foreign currency translation account. Any change in the fair value of the
Company’s outstanding net investment hedges that is the result of ineffectiveness would be recognized immediately in other

Foreign Exchange Options and forward contracts relating to the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk

The Company entered into a foreign currency collar consisting of option contracts to economically hedge the Bureau van Dijk euro denominated purchase price (as further
discussed in Note 7). These option contracts were not designated as accounting hedges under the applicable sections of Topic 815 of the ASC. The foreign currency option contracts consisted of separate put and call options each in the aggregate
notional amount of

€

2.7 billion. This collar was settled at the end of July 2017, in advance of the August 10, 2017 closing of the Bureau van Dijk acquisition.

The Company entered into foreign exchange forwards to hedge the Bureau van Dijk purchase price for the period from the settlement of the aforementioned foreign currency
collar until the closing date on August 10, 2017. These forward contracts were not designated as accounting hedges under the applicable sections of Topic 815 of the ASC. The foreign exchange contracts were to sell $2.8 billion and buy

ACQUISITIONS

The business combinations described below are accounted for using the acquisition method of
accounting whereby assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at fair value on the date of the transaction. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded to
goodwill. For all acquisitions excluding Bureau van Dijk, the Company has not presented pro forma combined results for these acquisitions because the impact on previously reported statements of operations


MOODY’S

would not have been material. Additionally, the near term impact to the Company’s operations and cash flows for these acquisitions (excluding Bureau van Dijk) is not material.

Bureau van Dijk

On August 10, 2017, a subsidiary of the Company acquired
100% of Yellow Maple I B.V., an indirect parent company of Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing B.V., a global provider of business intelligence and company information products. The cash payment of $3,542.0 million was funded with a
combination of cash on hand, primarily offshore, and new debt financing. The acquisition extends Moody’s position as a leader in risk data and analytical insight.

Shown below is the purchase price allocation, which summarizes the fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed, at the date of acquisition:

The Company has performed a preliminary valuation analysis of the fair market value of assets and liabilities of the Bureau van Dijk
business. The final purchase price allocation will be determined when the Company has completed and fully reviewed the detailed valuations. The final allocation could differ materially from the preliminary allocation. The final allocation may
include changes in allocations to acquired intangible assets as well as goodwill and other changes to assets and liabilities including reserves for uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities. The estimated useful lives of acquired
intangibles assets are also preliminary. Additionally, at December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed its allocation of certain of the goodwill acquired to other MA reporting units that are anticipated to benefit from synergies resulting from
the Bureau van Dijk acquisition.

Current assets in the table above include acquired cash of $36 million. Additionally, current assets include accounts
receivable of approximately $88 million (net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $3.7 million).

The amount of Bureau van Dijk’s revenue and Net
Income from August 10, 2017 through December 31, 2017 included in the Company’s statement of operations was $92.4 million and $63.7 million, respectively. The aforementioned net income includes a $57.9 million tax
benefit, as further described in Note 15, relating to a statutory tax rate reduction in Belgium which resulted in a decrease in deferred tax liabilities relating to acquired intangible assets. The acquired deferred revenue balance of approximately
$154 million was reduced by $53 million as part of acquisition accounting to establish the fair value of deferred revenue. This will reduce reported revenue by $53 million over the remaining contractual period of in-progress customer
arrangements assumed as of the acquisition date. This resulted in approximately $36 million less in reported revenue for the period from August 10, 2017 to December 31, 2017 with the remaining $17 million to reduce revenue in
2018. Amortization of acquired intangible assets was approximately $28 million for the period from August 10, 2017 through December 31, 2017.

Goodwill

Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations,
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Goodwill typically results through expected synergies from combining operations of an

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



acquiree and an acquirer, anticipated new customer acquisition and products, as well as from intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill recognized as a result of
this acquisition includes, among other things, the value of combining the complementary product portfolios of the Company and Bureau van Dijk which is expected to extend the Company’s reach to new and evolving market segments as well as cost
savings synergies, expected new customer acquisitions and products.

Goodwill, which has been assigned to the MA segment, is not deductible for tax purposes.

Bureau van Dijk will be a separate reporting unit for purposes of the Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment.

Other Liabilities Assumed

In connection with the acquisition, the Company
assumed liabilities relating to UTBs as well as deferred tax liabilities which relate to acquired intangible assets. These items are included in other liabilities in the table above.

Transaction and

Non-Recurring

Integration Costs.

In connection with the acquisition, the Company incurred transaction and

non-recurring

integration costs (Acquisition-Related
Expenses) through December 2017. Acquisition-Related Expenses of $22.5 million were comprised of transaction costs (consisting primarily of legal and advisory costs) of $8.6 million and

non-recurring

integration costs of $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Supplementary Unaudited Pro Forma Information

Supplemental information on an unaudited pro forma basis is presented below for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as if the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk
occurred on January 1, 2016. The pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only, based on certain estimates and assumptions, which the Company believes to be reasonable but not necessarily indicative of future
results of operations or the results that would have been reported if the acquisition had been completed at January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma information includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, based on the preliminary
purchase price allocation and an estimate of useful lives reflected above, and incremental financing costs resulting from the acquisition, net of income tax, which was estimated using the weighted average statutory tax rates in effect in the
jurisdiction for which the pro forma adjustment relates.

The unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of Bureau van
Dijk. Accordingly, the pro forma results above are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been reported if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated, nor are the pro forma results indicative of results which may occur in
the future. The Bureau van Dijk results included in the table above have been converted to U.S. GAAP from IFRS as issued by the IASB and have been translated to USD at rates in effect for the periods presented. As the unaudited pro forma results
give effect to the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016, the Bureau van Dijk amounts in the pro forma results include a reduction in revenue of approximately $58 million and $1 million relating to a
fair value adjustment to deferred revenue required as part of acquisition accounting for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. In addition, a corresponding pro forma adjustment was included to add back the approximate
$36 million reduction to reported revenue for the period from August 10, 2017 to December 31, 2017 relating to the deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting as of the actual August 10, 2017
acquisition date.

SCDM Financial

On February 13, 2017, a subsidiary
of the Company acquired the structured finance data and analytics business of SCDM Financial. The aggregate purchase price was not material and the near term impact to the Company’s operations and cash flow is not expected to be material. This
business unit operates in the MA reportable segment and goodwill related to this acquisition has been allocated to the RD&A reporting unit.

Korea Investor
Service (KIS)

In July 2016, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the

Gilliland Gold Young (GGY)

On March 1, 2016, subsidiaries of the Company
acquired 100% of GGY, a leading provider of advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry. The cash payments noted in the table below were funded with cash on hand. The acquisition of GGY will allow MA to provide an industry-leading
enterprise risk offering for global life insurers and reinsurers.

MOODY’S

2017 10-K


The following are descriptions of the methodologies utilized by the Company to estimate the fair value of its derivative
contracts, fixed maturity plans, and money market mutual funds:

Derivatives:

In determining the fair value of the derivative contracts in the table above, the Company utilizes industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models
project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using spot rates, forward points, currency volatilities, interest rates as well as the risk of

non-performance

of the Company and
the counterparties with whom it has derivative contracts. The Company established strict counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions that adhere to these guidelines. Accordingly, the risk of
counterparty default is deemed to be minimal.

Fixed maturity and open ended mutual funds:

The fixed maturity mutual funds and open ended mutual funds primarily represent exchange traded funds in India and are classified as securities

available-for-sale.

Accordingly, any unrealized gains and losses are recognized through OCI until the instruments mature or are sold.

Money market mutual funds:

The money market mutual funds represent publicly
traded funds with a stable $1 net asset value.

statements.

Settlement Charge

There was a charge of $863.8 million
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to an agreement entered into on January 13, 2017 with the U.S. Department of Justice and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia to resolve pending and potential civil
claims related to credit ratings that MIS assigned to certain structured finance instruments in the financial crisis era.


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


CCXI Gain:

CCXI is a Chinese
credit rating agency in which Moody’s acquired a 49% stake in 2006. Moody’s accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting. On March 21, 2017, CCXI, as part of a strategic business realignment, issued additional
capital to its majority shareholder in exchange for a ratings business wholly-owned by the majority shareholder and which has the right to rate a different class of debt instrument in the Chinese market. The capital issuance by CCXI in exchange for
this ratings business diluted Moody’s ownership interest in CCXI to 30% of a larger business and resulted in a $59.7 million

non-cash,

non-taxable

gain. The
issuance of additional capital by CCXI is treated as if Moody’s sold a 19% interest in CCXI at fair value. The fair value of the 19% interest in CCXI that Moody’s hypothetically sold was estimated using both a discounted cash flow
methodology and comparable public company multiples. A DCF analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows based on the budgets and forecasts of CCXI, expected long-term growth rates,
terminal values, WACC and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Moody’s will continue to account for its 30% interest in CCXI under the equity method of accounting.

PENSION AND OTHER RETIREMENT BENEFITS

U.S. Plans

Moody’s maintains funded and unfunded noncontributory Defined Benefit Pension Plans. The U.S. plans provide defined benefits using a cash balance formula based on
years of service and career average salary or final average pay for selected executives. The Company also provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired U.S. employees. The retirement healthcare plans are contributory; the life
insurance plans are noncontributory. Moody’s funded and unfunded U.S. pension plans, the U.S. retirement healthcare plans and the U.S. retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the “Retirement Plans”. The
U.S. retirement healthcare plans and the U.S. retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the “Other Retirement Plans”. Effective at the Distribution Date, Moody’s assumed responsibility for the pension and
other retirement benefits relating to its active employees. New D&B has assumed responsibility for the Company’s retirees and vested terminated employees as of the Distribution Date.

Through 2007, substantially all U.S. employees were eligible to participate in the Company’s DBPPs. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company no longer offers
DBPPs to U.S. employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 and new hires in the U.S. instead will receive a retirement contribution in similar benefit value under the Company’s Profit Participation Plan. Current participants of
the Company’s Retirement Plans and Other Retirement Plans continue to accrue benefits based on existing plan benefit formulas.

MOODY’S

The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the Company’s best estimate of the long-term return on plan
assets and is determined by using a building block approach, which generally weighs the underlying long-term expected rate of return for each major asset class based on their respective allocation target within the plan portfolio, net of plan paid
expenses. As the assumption reflects a long-term time horizon, the plan performance in any one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence the Company’s evaluation. For 2017, the expected rate of return used in calculating the
net periodic benefit costs was 5.40%. For 2018, the Company’s expected rate of return assumption is 4.50% to reflect the Company’s current view of long-term capital market outlook. In addition, the Company has updated its mortality
assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale

MP-2017

to accompany the

RP-2014

mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding
future mortality expectations by the Society of Actuaries. Additionally, the assumed healthcare cost trend rate assumption is not material to the valuation of the other retirement plans.

Plan Assets

Moody’s investment objective for the assets in the funded
pension plan is to earn total returns that will minimize future contribution requirements over the long-term within a prudent level of risk. The Company works with its independent investment consultants to determine asset allocation targets for its
pension plan investment portfolio based on its assessment of business and financial conditions, demographic and actuarial data, funding characteristics, and related risk factors. Other relevant factors, including historical and forward looking views
of inflation and capital market returns, are also considered. Risk management practices include monitoring plan asset performance, diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets.
The Company’s Asset Management Committee is responsible for overseeing the investment activities of the plan, which includes selecting acceptable asset classes, defining allowable ranges of holdings by asset class and by individual investment
managers, defining acceptable securities within each asset class, and establishing investment performance expectations. Ongoing monitoring of the plan includes reviews of investment performance and managers on a regular basis, annual liability
measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.

In 2014, the Company implemented a revised investment policy, which uses risk-controlled investment strategies by
increasing the plan’s asset allocation to fixed income securities and specifying ranges of acceptable target allocation by asset class based on different levels of the plan’s accounting funded status. In addition, the investment policy
also requires the investment-grade fixed income assets be rebalanced between shorter and longer duration bonds as the interest rate environment changes. This revised investment policy is designed to help protect the plan’s funded status and to
limit volatility of the Company’s contributions. Based on the revised policy, the Company’s current target asset allocation is approximately 53% (range of 48% to 58%) in equity securities, 40% (range of 35% to 45%) in fixed income
securities and 7% (range of 4% to 10%) in other investments and the plan will use a combination of active and passive investment strategies and different investment styles for its investment portfolios within each asset class. The plan’s equity
investments are diversified across U.S. and

non-U.S.

stocks of small, medium and large capitalization. The plan’s fixed income investments are diversified principally across U.S. and

non-U.S.

government and corporate bonds which are expected to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with obligations. The plan also invests in other fixed income investments
such as debts rated below investment grade, emerging market debt, and convertible securities. The plan’s other investment, which is made through a private real estate debt fund, is expected to provide additional diversification benefits and
absolute return enhancement to the plan assets.

Investments are measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient and have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the table are intended
to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the value of the total plan assets.

Cash and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of
investment in money market mutual funds. In determining fair value, Level 1 investments are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Investments in common/collective trust funds are valued


MOODY’S

2017 10-K


using the net asset value (NAV) per unit in each fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying investments owned by each trust, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of
shares outstanding. Common/collective trust funds are categorized in Level 2 to the extent that they are considered to have a readily determinable fair value. Investments for which fair value is estimated by using the NAV per share (or its
equivalent) as a practical expedient are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.

Except for the Company’s U.S. funded pension plan, all of Moody’s
Retirement Plans are unfunded and therefore have no plan assets.

Cash Flows

The Company contributed $25.9 million and $22.4 million to its U.S. funded pension plan during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The Company made payments of $5.1 million and $4.0 million related to its U.S. unfunded pension plan obligations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company made payments of $1.0 million and
$0.5 million to its Other Retirement Plans during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company is currently evaluating whether to make a contribution to its funded pension plan in 2018, and anticipates making
payments of $4.9 million related to its unfunded U.S. pension plans and $1.0 million related to its Other Retirement Plans during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Defined Contribution Plans

Moody’s has a
Profit Participation Plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. The Profit Participation Plan provides for an employee salary deferral and the Company matches employee contributions, equal to 50% of employee contribution up to a maximum of 3%
of the employee’s pay. Moody’s also makes additional contributions to the Profit Participation Plan based on

year-to-year

growth in the Company’s EPS.
Effective January 1, 2008, all new hires are automatically enrolled in the Profit Participation Plan when they meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. As the Company’s U.S. DBPPs are closed to new entrants
effective January 1, 2008, all eligible new hires will instead receive a retirement contribution into the Profit Participation Plan in value similar to the pension benefits. Additionally, effective January 1, 2008, the Company implemented
a deferred compensation plan in the U.S., which is unfunded and provides for employee deferral of compensation and Company matching contributions related to compensation in excess of the IRS limitations on benefits and contributions under qualified
retirement plans. Total expenses associated with U.S. defined contribution plans were $43.3 million, $28.3 million and $21.1 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The full year 2017 expense includes an accrued profit sharing
contribution.

Effective January 1, 2008, Moody’s has designated the Moody’s Stock Fund, an investment option under the Profit Participation Plan, as
an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and, as a result, participants in the Moody’s Stock Fund may receive dividends in cash or may reinvest such dividends into the Moody’s Stock Fund. Moody’s paid approximately $0.7 million during
each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the Company’s common shares held by the Moody’s Stock Fund. The Company records the dividends as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated
Statements of Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit). The Moody’s Stock Fund held approximately 457,000 and 471,000 shares of Moody’s common stock at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

International Plans

Certain of the Company’s international operations
provide pension benefits to their employees. The

non-U.S.

defined benefit pension plans are immaterial. For defined contribution plans, company contributions are primarily determined as a percentage of
employees’ eligible compensation. Moody’s also makes contributions to

non-U.S.

employees under a profit sharing plan which is based on

year-to-year

growth in the Company’s diluted EPS. Expenses related to these defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015
were $23.9 million, $24.5 million and $26.7 million, respectively.

NOTE 14

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

Under the 1998 Plan, 33.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock
have been reserved for issuance. The 2001 Plan, which is shareholder approved, permits the granting of up to 50.6 million shares, of which not more than 14.0 million shares are available for grants of awards other than stock options. The
Stock Plans also provide for the granting of restricted stock. The Stock Plans provide that options are exercisable not later than ten years from the grant date. The vesting period for awards under the Stock Plans is generally

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



determined by the Board at the date of the grant and has been four years except for employees who are at or near retirement eligibility, as defined, for which vesting is between one and four
years. Additionally, the vesting period is three years for certain performance-based restricted stock that contain a condition whereby the number of shares that ultimately vest are based on the achievement of certain

non-market

based performance metrics of the Company. Options may not be granted at less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant.

The Company maintains the Directors’ Plan for its Board, which permits the granting of awards in the form of

non-qualified

stock options, restricted stock or performance shares. The Directors’ Plan provides that options are exercisable not later than ten years from the grant date. The vesting period is determined by the Board at the date of the grant and is
generally one year for both options and restricted stock. Under the Directors’ Plan, 1.7 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. Any director of the Company who is not an employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries as of the date that an award is granted is eligible to participate in the Directors’ Plan.

Amount includes a decrease in deferred tax assets resulting from a future reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in accordance with the Tax Act, more fully described in Note 15.

The fair value of each employee stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted below.
The expected dividend yield is derived from the annual dividend rate on the date of grant. The expected stock volatility is based on an assessment of historical weekly stock prices of the Company as well as implied volatility from Moody’s
traded options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. government zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to the expected holding period. The expected holding period was determined by examining historical and projected post-vesting exercise
behavior activity.

The following weighted average assumptions were used for options granted:

As of December 31, 2017, there was $31.0 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to this plan. The expense is
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.0 years.

The Company has a policy of issuing treasury stock to satisfy shares issued under stock-based
compensation plans.

In addition, the Company also sponsors the ESPP. Under the ESPP, 6.0 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. The ESPP
allows eligible employees to purchase common stock of the Company on a monthly basis at a discount to the average of the high and the low trading prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day of each month. This discount was 5% in
2017, 2016 and 2015 resulting in the ESPP qualifying for

non-compensatory

status under Topic 718 of the ASC. Accordingly, no compensation

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



expense was recognized for the ESPP in 2017, 2016, and 2015. The employee purchases are funded through

after-tax

payroll deductions, which plan
participants can elect from one percent to ten percent of compensation, subject to the annual federal limit.

Amounts are primarily set to expire beginning in 2018, if unused.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was
signed into law which resulted in significant changes to U.S. corporate tax laws. The Tax Act includes a mandatory

one-time

deemed repatriation tax (“transition tax”) on previously untaxed
accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and beginning in 2018 reduces the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Due to the complexities of the Tax Act, the SEC issued guidance requiring that companies provide a reasonable
estimate of the impact of the Tax Act to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Accordingly, the Company recorded a provisional estimate for the transition tax of $247.3 million, a portion of which will be payable over eight
years, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest. Additionally, the Company recorded a provisional estimate decreasing net deferred tax assets by $56.2 million resulting from the future reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate.
Separately, a statutory tax rate reduction in Belgium resulted in a $57.9 million decrease of deferred tax liabilities pertaining to Bureau van Dijk’s acquired intangible assets.

The above provisional estimates may be impacted by a number of additional considerations, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations and our ongoing
analysis of the new law.

As a result of the Tax Act, all previously undistributed foreign earnings have now been subject to U.S. tax. However, the Company intends to
continue to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. and accordingly the Company has not provided non-U.S. deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. It is not practicable to determine the amount of non-U.S.
deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future, due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

2016-09,

Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment
Accounting as more fully discussed in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The new guidance requires all tax effects related to share based payments to be recorded through the income statement. The Company has adopted the new
guidance as

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



of the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption resulted in a reduction in its income tax provision of approximately $40 million, or 220BPS, for the full year of 2017.

In the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update

2016-16,

“Accounting for Income Taxes:
Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.” Under previous guidance, the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers (intercompany sales) were deferred until the transferred asset was sold to a third party or otherwise
recovered through use. The new guidance eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sales of assets other than inventory. Upon adoption, a cumulative-effect adjustment is recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
The net impact upon adoption is a reduction to retained earnings of $4.6 million. The Company does not expect any material impact on its future operations as a result of the adoption of this guidance.

The Company had valuation allowances of $12.8 million and $3.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to foreign net operating losses
for which realization is uncertain.

As of December 31, 2017 the Company had $389.1 million of UTPs of which $353.0 million represents the amount that,
if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods. The increase in UTPs results primarily from the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk.

A

The Company classifies interest related to UTPs in interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties, if incurred,
would be recognized in other

non-operating

expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred a net interest expense of $15.3 million and $7.8 million
respectively, related to UTPs. An additional $5.6 million of accrued interest was recorded in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Bureau van Dijk. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the amount of accrued interest recorded in
the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to UTPs was $54.7 million and $34.1 million, respectively.

Moody’s Corporation and subsidiaries
are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2011 and 2012 are under examination and its 2013 to 2016 returns remain
open to examination. The Company’s New York State income tax returns for 2011 to 2016 are under examination. The Company’s New York City tax return for 2014 is under examination and 2015 to 2016 remain open to examination. The
Company’s U.K. tax return for 2012 is under examination. Tax filings in the U.K. remain open to examination for 2013 through 2016.

For current ongoing audits
related to open tax years, the Company estimates that it is possible that the balance of UTPs could decrease in the next twelve months as a result of the effective settlement of these audits, which might involve the payment of additional taxes, the
adjustment of certain deferred taxes and/or the recognition of tax benefits. It is also possible that new issues might be raised by tax authorities which might necessitate increases to the balance of UTPs. As the Company is unable to predict the
timing of conclusion of these audits, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of changes to the balance of UTPs at this time.

The Company has entered into interest rate swaps on the 2010 Senior Notes, the 2012 Senior Notes and the 2014 Senior Notes

(5-Year)

which are more fully discussed in Note 5 above.

Term Loan Facility

On June 6, 2017, the Company
entered into a three-year term loan facility with the capacity to borrow up to $500.0 million. On August 8, 2017, the Company borrowed $500 million under the 2017 Term Loan for which the proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of
Bureau van Dijk and to pay acquisition-related fees and expenses. At the Company’s election, interest on borrowings under the 2017 Term Loan is payable at rates that are based on either (a) Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the 2017 Term
Loan Facility agreement) plus an applicable rate (ranging from 0 BPS to 50 BPS per annum) or (b) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the 2017 Term Loan Facility agreement) plus an applicable rate (ranging from 87.5 BPS to 150 BPS per annum),
in each case, depending on the Company’s index debt rating, as set forth in the 2017 Term Loan agreement.

The 2017 Term Loan contains covenants that, among
other things, restrict the ability of the Company to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates, sale and leaseback transactions or to incur liens, with exceptions as set forth in the 2017 Term Loan Facility
agreement. The 2017 Term Loan also contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a

MOODY’S

2017 10-K



debt to EBITDA ratio of not more than: (i) 4.5 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 and (ii) 4.0 to 1.0 as
of the end of the fiscal quarter ended on June 30, 2018. The 2017 Term Loan also contains customary events of default.

Credit Facility

On May 11, 2015, the Company entered into a five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility with the capacity to borrow up to $1 billion. This replaced
the $1 billion five-year 2012 Facility that was scheduled to expire in April 2017. On June 6, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2015 Facility. Pursuant to the amendment, the applicable rate for borrowings under the
2015 Facility will range from 0 BPS to 32.5 BPS per annum for Alternate Base Rate loans (as defined in the 2015 Facility agreement) and 79.5 BPS to 132.5 BPS per annum for Eurocurrency loans (as defined in the 2015 Facility agreement) depending
on the Company’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA. In addition, the Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the 2015 Facility. Pursuant to the amendment, the facility fee paid by the Company ranges
from 8 BPS to 17.5 BPS on the daily amount of commitments (whether used or unused), in each case, depending on the Company’s index debt rating. The amendment also modifies, among other things, the existing financial covenant, so that, the
Company’s debt to EBITDA ratio shall not exceed 4.5 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 and shall not exceed 4.0 to 1.0 as of the end of the fiscal
quarter ended on June 30, 2018 and each fiscal quarter thereafter. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events of default constituting a default under the 2015 Facility, all
loans outstanding under the 2015 Facility (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all lending commitments under the 2015 Facility may be terminated. In addition, certain other events
of default under the 2015 Facility would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and the termination of all lending commitments.

Commercial Paper

On August 3, 2016, the Company entered into a
private placement commercial paper program under which the Company may issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the CP Program are backstopped by the 2015 Facility. Amounts under the CP Program may be

re-borrowed.

The maturity of the CP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The CP Notes are sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, sold at par and bear interest at rates that
will vary based upon market conditions. The rates of interest will depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) certificate of deposit rate;
(b) commercial paper rate; (c) the federal funds rate; (d) the LIBOR; (e) prime rate; (f) Treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement to the private placement agreement. The CP Program
contains certain events of default including, among other things:

non-payment

of principal, interest or fees; entrance into any form of moratorium; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain
instances to cure periods. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has CP borrowings outstanding of $130 million with a weighted average maturity date at the time of issuance of 30 days. At December 31, 2017, the weighted average
remaining maturity and interest rate on CP outstanding was 15 days and 1.76% respectively.

Notes Payable

On September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.06% Series

2007-1

Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 pursuant to the 2007 Agreement. The Series

2007-1

Notes had a

ten-year

term and bore interest at

NOTE 19

CONTINGENCIES

Given the nature of their activities, Moody’s and its subsidiaries are subject to legal and tax
proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, and claims and litigation that are based on ratings assigned by MIS or that are otherwise incidental to the Company’s business. The Company periodically
receives and responds to subpoenas and other inquiries which may relate to Moody’s activities or to activities of others that may result in claims and litigation, proceedings or investigations by private litigants or governmental, regulatory or
legislative authorities. Moody’s also is subject to ongoing tax audits as addressed in Note 15 to the financial statements.

Management periodically assesses the
Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, the Company
records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate
of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In instances when a loss is reasonably possible but
uncertainties exist related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its
assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. Moody’s also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

In view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims
and litigation and similar matters and contingencies, particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company often cannot predict what the
eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also may be unable to predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive
position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome
of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required. However, because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or
resolutions can occur, the ultimate outcome of such matters, including the amount of any loss, may differ from those estimates.

NOTE 20

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company is organized into two operating segments: MIS and MA and accordingly, the
Company reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA.

The MIS segment consists of five LOBs. The CFG, SFG, FIG and PPIF LOBs generate revenue principally from fees
for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. The MIS Other LOB primarily consists of financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific
region as well as ICRA

non-ratings

revenue.

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the
risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. The MA segment consists of three LOBs—RD&A, ERS and PS.

On
August 10, 2017, a subsidiary of the Company acquired Yellow Maple I B.V., an indirect parent of Bureau van Dijk, a global provider of business intelligence and company information products. Bureau van Dijk is part of the MA reportable segment
and its revenue is included in the RD&A LOB. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion on the acquisition.

Revenue for MIS and expenses for MA include an
intersegment royalty charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. The royalty rate charged by MIS approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content, data and products and is generally based
on comparable market transactions. Also, revenue for MA and expenses for MIS include an intersegment fee charged to MIS from MA for certain MA products and services utilized in MIS’s ratings process. These fees charged by MA are generally equal
to the costs incurred by MA to produce these products and services. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company that exclusively benefit only one segment are fully charged to that segment. Overhead costs and corporate expenses
of the Company that benefit both segments are allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. Accordingly, a reportable segment’s share of these costs will increase as its proportion of revenue relative to Moody’s total
revenue increases. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resources and information technology. “Eliminations” in the table below represent intersegment
revenue/expense. Moody’s does not report the Company’s assets by reportable segment, as this metric is not used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets
by reportable segment.

Financial Information by Segment

The table below
shows revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and operating income by reportable segment. Adjusted Operating Income is a financial metric utilized by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to assess the profitability of each reportable
segment.

segments are $10.2 and $1.8 million, respectively. The charge in MA reflects cost management initiatives in certain corporate overhead functions of which portion is allocated to MA based on a revenue-split methodology.

December 31, 2016 primarily reflect the Settlement Charge of $863.8 million ($700.7 million,

net-of-tax).

In addition, the net loss attributable to
Moody’s for the three months ended December 31, 2016 includes an approximate $35 million FX gain related to the liquidation of a subsidiary as well as benefits of $1.6 million to net income related to the resolution of Legacy Tax

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company carried out an evaluation, as required by Rule

13a-15(b)

under the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rule

13a-15(e)

of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the Evaluation
Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the communication to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company acquired Bureau van Dijk and management has excluded this acquired business from its assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of
the Evaluation Date. The total assets (excluding acquired goodwill and intangible assets which are included within the scope of this assessment) and revenues of Bureau van Dijk represents approximately $322 million and $92 million, respectively, of
the corresponding amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.

Changes In Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”,
in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form

Except as described below, the Company’s management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has determined that there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, these internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this report.

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017,
the Company acquired Bureau van Dijk, and we are in the process of integrating the acquired entity into the Company’s financial reporting processes and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Additionally, during the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2017, the Company implemented internal controls relating to the adoption and assessment of the impact of the new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition which will be adopted by Moody’s on
