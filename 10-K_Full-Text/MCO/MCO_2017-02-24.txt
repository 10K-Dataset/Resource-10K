PART I

ITEM

1. BUSINESS

BACKGROUND

As used in this report, except where the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Moody’s” or the “Company” refer to Moody’s Corporation, a
Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. The Company’s executive offices are located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10007 and its telephone number is (212) 553-0300.

THE COMPANY

Moody’s is a provider of
(i) credit ratings, (ii) credit, capital markets and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) software solutions and related risk management services, (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, financial services
training and certification services and (v) research and analytical services to financial institution customers. Moody’s reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA. Financial information and operating results of these segments,
including revenue, expenses and operating income, are included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements of this annual report, and are herein incorporated by reference.

MIS publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate and
governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. Ratings revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to
investors. MIS provides ratings in more than 120 countries. Ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media, including the Internet and real-time information systems widely used by securities
traders and investors. As of December 31, 2016, MIS had ratings relationships with approximately 11,000 corporate issuers and approximately 18,000 public finance issuers. Additionally, the Company has rated and currently monitors ratings on
approximately 64,000 structured finance obligations (representing approximately 12,000 transactions). The aforementioned amounts relating to the number of issuers and transactions represent issuers or transactions that had an active rating at any
point during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations which consist primarily of the distribution of research and financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific
region as well as revenue from ICRA non-rating operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global
financial markets. Within its Research, Data and Analytics business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, commentary on topical credit
related events and also provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores. Within its Enterprise Risk Solutions business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management
services. Within its Professional Services business it provides research and analytical services along with financial training and certification programs. MA customers represent more than 4,600 institutions worldwide operating in approximately 145
countries. During 2016 Moody’s research website was accessed by over 258,000 individuals including 36,000 client users.

PROSPECTS
FOR GROWTH

Over recent decades, global fixed-income markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and types of securities or other obligations
outstanding. Beginning in mid-2007, there was a severe market disruption and associated financial crisis both in the developed and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak
economic performance in advanced economies. Since this financial crisis, many markets and economies have recovered and Moody’s believes the overall long-term outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixed-income market and
related financial information market, which includes information such as credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services.


MOODY’S

2016 10K


Moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including:

»

Health of the world’s major economies;

»

Debt capital markets activity;

»

Disintermediation of credit markets;

»

Fiscal and monetary policy of governments;

»

Changing regulatory requirements; and

»

Business investment spending, including mergers and acquisitions.

Moody’s is well positioned to benefit from
continued growth in global fixed-income market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings as well as research and related analytical products in an environment with heightened attention to credit risk analysis and management. Moody’s
expects that these developments will support continued long-term demand for high-quality, independent credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services.

Strong secular trends should continue to provide long-term growth opportunities. Moody’s key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global GDP growth,
continued disintermediation of fixed-income markets in both developed and emerging economies driving issuance and demand for new products and services, growth in MA driven by further penetration into MA’s client base and expansion of bank and
insurance risk regulatory requirements, pricing opportunities aligned with value, and advances in information technology.

Growth in global fixed income markets in a
given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, business investment spending, corporate refinancing needs, merger and acquisition activity, issuer profits, consumer borrowing levels and
securitization activity. Rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of MIS. Therefore, a substantial portion of MIS’s revenue is dependent upon the dollar-equivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in
the global capital markets. MIS’s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and prospects for growth of the major world economies, the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments, and the decisions of issuers to
request MIS ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions. However, annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers, annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and medium-term note programs, bank deposit ratings,
insurance company financial strength ratings, mutual fund ratings, and other areas partially mitigate MIS’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixed-income markets. Furthermore, the strong growth seen
in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid-1990’s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil, with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010, before stabilizing in 2011 with Moody’s experiencing revenue growth in
this market beginning in 2012. Despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels, Moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixed-income markets and provide opportunities for
longer-term revenue growth.

The pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely
available throughout the world and facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and similarly investors’ ability to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets. Technology
also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell, which in the absence of the appropriate technology might not be
readily or easily obtainable. This availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide, giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of both established and newer capital markets. As
technology provides broader access to worldwide markets, it also results in a greater need for credible, globally comparable opinions about credit risk, data, analytics and related services. Additionally, information technology also provides
opportunities to further build a global platform to support Moody’s continued expansion in developing markets.

An ongoing trend in the world’s capital
markets is the disintermediation of financial systems. Issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets, in addition to, or in substitution for, traditional financial intermediaries. Moreover, financial intermediaries have
sold assets in the global public capital markets, in addition to, or instead of, retaining those assets. Moody’s believes that issuer use of global debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to traditional banking
systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue. Further, disintermediation has continued because of the ongoing low interest rate environment and bank deleveraging, which has encouraged a number of corporations and other
entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets.

Moody’s also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace
internal banking system capacity. Thus, disintermediation is expected to continue over the longer-term, with Moody’s targeting investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust.

In response to the credit market disruptions beginning in mid-2007, ongoing volatility in the global capital markets and new
regulatory requirements, financial institutions are investing in people, processes and systems to enhance risk management and compliance functions. Regulations such as the Financial Reform Act, Basel II, Basel III, Solvency II and others may
stimulate demand for MA products. Financial institutions are also investing in advanced qualitative and quantitative tools and services to support their management of complex balance sheets and diverse portfolios as well as operating costs. MA
offers a suite of risk management products and services to address these needs, including but not limited to risk management software, economic analysis, training and professional services.

Legislative bodies and regulators in the U.S., Europe and other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of CRAs, which may result in, for example, an
increased number of competitors, changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of MIS, removal of references to ratings in certain regulations, or increased costs of doing business for MIS. Therefore, in order to
broaden the potential for expansion of non-ratings services, Moody’s reorganized in January 2008 into two distinct businesses: MIS, consisting primarily of the ratings business, and MA, which conducts activities including the sale of credit
research produced by MIS and the production and sale of other economic and credit-related products and services. The reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by MA into activities that may have otherwise been restricted for MIS, due
to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business. At present, Moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities.

Moody’s operations are subject to various risks, as more fully described in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” inherent in conducting business on a
global basis. Such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization, expropriation, exchange and price controls, changes in the availability of data from public sector sources, limits on providing information across borders and other
restrictive governmental actions.

COMPETITION

MIS competes with other CRAs and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research. Many users of MIS’s ratings also have in-house
credit research capabilities. MIS’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is S&P Global Ratings (S&P), a division of S&P Global. There are some rating markets, based on industry, geography and/or instrument type,
in which Moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to S&P, while in other markets, the reverse is true.

In addition to S&P,
MIS’s competitors include Fitch Ratings, Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS), A.M. Best Company, Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd., Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc., Morningstar Inc. and Egan-Jones Ratings Company. In Europe, there are approximately
30 companies currently registered with ESMA, which include both purely domestic European CRAs and International CRAs such as S&P, Fitch and DBRS. There are additional competitors in other regions and countries, for example, in China, where
Moody’s participates through a joint venture. These competitors include China Lianhe Credit Rating Co Ltd., Shanghai Brilliance Credit Rating & Investors Service Co Ltd., Dagong Global Credit Rating Co Ltd. and Pengyuan Credit Rating
Co Ltd.

MA competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified competitors such as Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg, S&P Global Market
Intelligence, Fitch Solutions, Dun & Bradstreet, IBM, Wolters Kluwer, Fidelity Information Services, SAS, Fiserv, MSCI and IHS Markit among others. MA’s main competitors within RD&A include S&P Global Market Intelligence,
CreditSights, Thomson Reuters, Intex, IHS Markit, BlackRock Solutions, FactSet and other providers of fixed income analytics, valuations, economic data and research. In ERS, MA faces competition from both large software providers such as IBM
Algorithmics, Fidelity Information Services, SAS, Oracle, Misys, Oliver Wyman, Verisk and various other vendors and in-house solutions. Within Professional Services, MA competes with Omega Performance, DC Gardner, and a host of financial training
and education firms, and with Evalueserve, CRISIL Global Research 
& Analytics, and other providers of research and professional services, respectively.

MOODY’S STRATEGY

Moody’s corporate strategy is to be the world’s most respected authority serving financial risk-sensitive markets. The key aspects to implement this strategy
are to:

»

Defend and enhance the core ratings and research business of MIS;

»

Build MA’s position as a leading provider of risk management solutions to financial institutions; and

»

Invest in strategic growth opportunities.

Moody’s will make investments to defend and enhance its core businesses in
an attempt to position the Company to fully capture market opportunities resulting from global debt capital market expansion and increased business investment spending. Moody’s will also make strategic investments to achieve scale in attractive
financial information markets, move into attractive product and service adjacencies where the Company can leverage its brand, extend its thought leadership and expand its geographic presence in high growth emerging markets.


MOODY’S

2016 10K


To broaden the Company’s potential, MA provides a wide range of products and services to enable financial institutions
to better manage risk. As such, MA adds to the Company’s value proposition in three ways. First, MA’s subscription businesses provide a significant base of recurring revenue to offset cyclicality in ratings issuance volumes that may result
in volatility to MIS’s revenues. Second, MA products and services, such as financial training and professional services on research and risk management best practices, provide opportunities for entry into emerging markets before debt capital
markets fully develop and thus present long-term growth opportunities for the ratings business. Finally, MA’s integrated risk management software platform embeds Moody’s solutions deep into the technology infrastructure of banks and
insurance companies worldwide.

Moody’s invests in initiatives to implement the Company’s strategy, including internally-led organic development and
targeted acquisitions. Example initiatives include:

»

Enhancements to ratings quality and product extensions;

»

Investments that extend ownership and participation in joint ventures and strategic alliances;

»

Headcount growth to meet customer demand for new products and services;

»

Selective, bolt-on acquisitions that accelerate the ability to scale and grow Moody’s businesses; and

»

Expansion in emerging markets.

During 2016, Moody’s continued to acquire complementary businesses in MIS and MA. In
February 2016, Moody’s made an investment in Finagraph, which is a provider of automated financial data collection and business intelligence solutions. In conjunction with this investment Moody’s expects to broaden its offering of credit
risk solutions covering SMEs, including Moody’s Analytics Lending Cloud software and default risk models. In March 2016, Moody’s acquired GGY, a leading provider of advanced actuarial software for the global life insurance industry.
Combined with Moody’s Analytics’ insurance risk products, the GGY acquisition creates an industry-leading enterprise risk offering for global life insurers and reinsurers. In July 2016, Moody’s acquired full ownership of Korea
Investors Service (KIS), one of Korea’s leading providers of domestic credit ratings. KIS had been a majority-owned affiliate of Moody’s Investors Service since 2001, and will continue to operate as an independent affiliate of Moody’s
Investors Service. As part of the transaction, Moody’s also gained majority ownership in KIS Pricing, which had been a majority-owned subsidiary of KIS and is a provider of pricing services and analytics for fixed income and other local
securities. In September 2016, Moody’s announced a collaboration with Euler Hermes Rating GmbH (EHRG), a Hamburg-based ratings agency and subsidiary of Euler Hermes, to provide credit ratings for SMEs across Europe. As part of the
collaboration, Moody’s acquired a 4.99% stake in EHRG.

REGULATION

MIS and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries (including by state and local authorities). Thus,
existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company’s operations and the markets for securities that it rates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being
considered. Each of the existing, adopted, proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact Moody’s operations or profitability, the
Company’s ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings, in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which Moody’s operates.

The regulatory landscape has changed rapidly in recent years, and continues to evolve. In the EU, the CRA industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European
regulatory framework. The European Securities and Markets Authority has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered CRA industry throughout the EU. MIS is a registered entity and is subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection.
Applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory rotation requirements of CRAs hired by issuers of
securities for ratings of resecuritizations, restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed, reporting requirements to ESMA regarding fees, and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing
of services. CRA3 also requires that ESMA and the European Commission produce several reports on the industry’s structure and the use of ratings. In October 2015, ESMA published its reports, wherein it acknowledged the impact of regulation on
the industry, and stated that it will continue to monitor the industry structure over the next three to five years. On October 19, 2016, the Commission published its analysis, reaching a conclusion similar to ESMA’s that no new legislation
is needed for the industry at this time, but that it will continue to monitor the credit rating market and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation.

Separately, on June 23, 2016 the U.K. voted through a referendum to exit the EU. The longer-term impacts of the decision to leave the EU on the overall regulatory
framework for the U.K. will depend, in part, on the relationship that the U.K. negotiates with the EU in the future. In the interim, however, the U.K.’s markets regulator (the Financial Conduct Authority) has said that all EU financial
regulations

MOODY’S

2016 10K



will stay in place and that firms must continue to abide by their existing obligations. As a consequence, at this point in time, there is no change to the regulatory framework under which MIS
operates and ESMA remains MIS’s regulator both in the EU and in the U.K.

In the U.S., CRAs are subject to extensive regulation primarily pursuant to the Reform
Act and the Financial Reform Act. The SEC is required by these legislative acts to publish two annual reports to Congress on NRSROs. The Financial Reform Act requires the SEC to examine each NRSRO once a year and issue an annual report summarizing
the examination findings, among other requirements. The annual report required by the Reform Act details the SEC’s views on the state of competition, transparency and conflicts of interests among NRSROs, among other requirements. The SEC voted
in August 2014 to adopt its final rules for NRSROs as required by the Financial Reform Act. The Company has made and continues to make substantial IT and other investments, and has implemented the relevant compliance obligations.

In light of the regulations that have gone into effect in both the EU and the U.S. (as well as many other countries), from time to time and as a matter of course pursuant
to their enabling legislation these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe their oversight activities over the industry. In addition, other legislation and/or interpretation of existing regulation relating to
credit rating and research services is being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future. Finally, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to
locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. If enacted, any such legislation and regulation could change the
competitive landscape in which MIS operates. The legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future. Management of the
Company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted, the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings, or regulatory or legislative actions, or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive
position, financial position or results of operations of Moody’s.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be
carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company’s management currently deems minor or
insignificant also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. These risk factors should be read in
conjunction with the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K.

U.S. Laws and Regulations Affecting the Credit Rating Industry May Negatively Impact
the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business.

Moody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by
federal, state and local authorities in the U.S., including the Reform Act and the Financial Reform Act. These regulations are complex, continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time. See “Regulation” in Part 1,
Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information. These laws and regulations:

»

seek to encourage, and may result in, increased competition among rating agencies and in the credit rating business;

»

may result in alternatives to credit ratings or changes in the pricing of credit ratings;

»

restrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings;

»

increase regulatory oversight of the credit markets and CRA operations;

»

provide for direct jurisdiction of the SEC over CRAs that seek NRSRO status, and grant authority to the SEC to inspect the operations of CRAs; and

»

authorize the adoption of enhanced oversight standards and new pleading standards, which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities
and aggregate legal defense costs.

These laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking or court rulings, could result in reduced demand for credit
ratings and increased costs, which Moody’s may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. The Company may be required to incur
significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to
accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on Moody’s business and its customers’ businesses. For example, new laws and regulations may affect MIS’s communications with issuers as part of the rating
assignment process, alter the manner in which MIS’s ratings are developed, assigned and communicated, affect the manner in which MIS or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for MIS’s ratings and alter the
economics of the credit ratings business, including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies. Further, speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential
liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect Moody’s stock price. Although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally, they may affect
Moody’s in a disproportionate manner. Each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s operations, profitability and
competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.

Financial Reforms Outside the U.S. Affecting the Credit
Rating Industry May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business.

In addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and
regulations governing the industry, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings. In particular, the EU has adopted a common regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the
EU. As a result, ESMA has direct supervisory authority for CRAs in the EU and has the power to take enforcement action against non-compliant CRAs, including through the issuance of public notices, withdrawal of registration and, in some cases, the
imposition of fines.

MIS is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection in the EU. Applicable rules include procedural
requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory rotation requirements of CRAs hired by issuers of securities for ratings of
resecuritizations, and restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed. Additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings, rules regarding the organization
of CRAs, restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest, pricing regulations, and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments. Compliance with the EU regulations may increase our costs of operations and
could have a significant negative effect on Moody’s operations, profitability or ability to compete, or the markets for its products and services, including in ways that Moody’s presently is unable to predict. In addition, exposure to
increased liability under the EU regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact Moody’s results of operations.

MOODY’S

2016 10K



The EU and other jurisdictions engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that could significantly impact operations or the
markets for Moody’s products and services, including regulations extending to products and services not currently regulated and regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated, increasing the level of competition in the market
for credit ratings, establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings. Moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations, and the effect that they will have on
Moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant. Financial reforms in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial
condition.

The Company Faces Exposure to Litigation and Government Regulatory Proceedings, Investigations and Inquiries Related to Rating Opinions and Other
Business Practices.

Moody’s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries related to MIS’s
ratings actions, as well as other business practices and products. If the market value of credit-dependent instruments declines or defaults, whether as a result of difficult economic times, turbulent markets or otherwise, the number of
investigations and legal proceedings that Moody’s faces could increase significantly. Parties who invest in securities rated by MIS may pursue claims against MIS or Moody’s for losses they face in their portfolios. We have faced numerous
class action lawsuits and other litigation, government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the recent financial crisis. Legal
proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues, and any of these proceedings,
investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions. Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability
standards comparable to those that exist in the U.S. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby
increasing the risk of successful litigations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify. Moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the
existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, to the extent that Moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial, the aggregate legal
defense costs incurred by Moody’s increase substantially, as does the risk of an adverse outcome. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the Company
currently faces. Due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought, there is a risk that Moody’s will be subject to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other adverse results that could have a material
adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company is Exposed to Legal, Economic, Operational and Regulatory Risks of
Operating in Multiple Jurisdictions.

Moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue
from foreign sources. Changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the Company operates may have an impact on the Company’s business. For example, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone or elsewhere could affect the
number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas. In addition, operations abroad expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as:

»

exposure to exchange rate movements between foreign currencies and USD;

»

restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into USD and the costs, including the tax impact, of repatriating cash held by entities outside the U.S.;

»

U.S. laws affecting overseas operations including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers;

»

differing and potentially conflicting legal or civil liability, compliance and regulatory standards including as a result of the U.K.’s referendum vote whereby the U.K. citizens voted to withdraw from the EU,
Brexit;

»

current and future regulations relating to the imposition of mandatory rotation requirements on CRAs hired by issuers of securities;

»

uncertain and evolving laws and regulations, including those applicable to the financial services industries and to the protection of intellectual property;

»

economic, political and geopolitical market conditions;

»

the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions;

»

competition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions;

»

reduced protection for intellectual property rights;

»

longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables;

»

differing accounting principles and standards;

»

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

»

difficulties and delays in translating documentation into foreign languages; and

»

potentially adverse tax consequences.

Additionally, Moody’s is subject to complex U.S., foreign and other local laws
and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Although the Company has implemented internal controls,
policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and
violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that the Company has violated anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with
international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to the Company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties,
criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s reputation, its ability to attract and retain employees, its business, operating results and financial condition.

Moody’s Operations and Infrastructure May Malfunction or Fail.

Moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities
in which Moody’s is located, including New York City, the location of Moody’s headquarters, major cities worldwide in which Moody’s has offices, and locations in China used for certain Moody’s Analytics back office work. This may
include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure (whether or not controlled by the Company), including the Company’s electronic delivery systems, data center facilities, or the Internet, used by the Company or third
parties with or through whom Moody’s conducts business. Many of the Company’s products and services are delivered electronically and the Company’s customers depend on the Company’s ability to receive, store, process, transmit and
otherwise rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data and transactions on computer-based networks. The Company’s customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of the Company’s telecommunications, data
centers, networks and other electronic delivery systems, including its websites and connections to the Internet. The Company’s employees also depend on these systems for internal use. Any significant failure, compromise, cyber-breach or
interruption of the Company’s infrastructure, whether due to human error, hardware failure or defect, natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism,
political unrest, war or otherwise, may impair the Company’s ability to deliver its products and services.

Moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential
disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful. The Company relies on third-party providers to provide certain essential services. While the Company believes that such providers are reliable, the Company has limited control over
the performance of such providers. To the extent any of the Company’s third-party providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fails to adequately expand its services to meet the Company’s needs and
the needs of the Company’s customers, the Company could experience lower revenues and higher costs. Additionally, although the Company maintains processes to prevent, detect and recover from a disruption, the Company also does not have fully
redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of Moody’s locations or systems and its
personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with Moody’s clients and customers may
suffer. The Company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the Company’s failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to
Moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.

The
Company is Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Protection of Confidential Information.

The Company’s operations rely on the secure processing,
storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its clients and employees in the Company’s computer systems and
networks, and in those of its third party vendors. The cyber risks the Company faces range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats that target the Company because of its prominence in the global marketplace, or due to
its ratings of sovereign debt. Breaches of Moody’s or Moody’s vendors’ technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks,
computer viruses, ransomware, or malware, employee error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions, may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company’s
or such vendors’ web sites, applications, data processing, or disruption of other business operations, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the Company (including information about Moody’s
business, employees or customers), as well as sensitive personally identifiable

MOODY’S

2016 10K



information (“PII”), the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. Measures that Moody’s takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents can be
expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against
cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers. Any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of perceived
security vulnerabilities to the Company’s systems or those of the Company’s third parties, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could cause the Company to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions,
sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the Company’s clients’ information, or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the
Company. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results, or financial condition.

Changes in the Volume of
Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business.

Moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets. Furthermore, issuers of debt securities may elect
to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by non-traditional parties such as financial advisors, rather than traditional CRAs, such as MIS. A majority of Moody’s credit-rating-based revenue is
transaction-based, and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the volume of
debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings. Potential changes to U.S. tax laws and policy could negatively affect the volume of debt securities issued in the U.S. Conditions that reduce issuers’ ability
or willingness to issue debt securities, such as market volatility, declining growth, currency devaluations or other adverse economic trends, reduce the number and dollar-equivalent volume of debt issuances for which Moody’s provides ratings
services and thereby adversely affect the fees Moody’s earns in its ratings business.

Economic and government factors such as a long-term continuation of
difficult economic conditions and a worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. Future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates, widening credit
spreads, regulatory and political developments, growth in the use of alternative sources of credit, and defaults by significant issuers. Declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the
Company’s business, operating results and financial condition.

Moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be
sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term, due in part to rent, technology, compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the Company’s operations as well as the need to monitor
outstanding ratings. Further, cost-reduction initiatives, including those undertaken to date, could make it difficult for the Company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings. Volatility
in the financial markets, including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates, may have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition, which the Company may not be able to
successfully offset with cost reductions.

The Company Faces Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers.

There is price competition in the credit rating, research, credit risk management markets, research and analytical services and financial training and certification
services. Moody’s faces competition globally from other CRAs and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research, as well as from in-house research operations. Competition for customers and market share has
spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services, as well as increased competition from non-NRSROs that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors. At the same time, a challenging business environment and
consolidation among customers, particularly those involved in structured finance products, and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the Company’s customer base. Weak economic growth is also
intensifying competitive pricing pressures and can result in customers’ use of free or lower-cost information that is available from alternative sources. While Moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products
and services, it may lose market share if its pricing is not sufficiently competitive. In addition, the Reform Act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies. The formation of additional NRSROs may increase pricing and competitive
pressures. Furthermore, in some of the countries in which Moody’s operates, governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies. Any inability of Moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its
products and services could have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company is Exposed to Reputation and
Credibility Concerns.

Moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths. To the extent that the rating agency business as a
whole or Moody’s, relative to its competitors, suffers a loss in credibility, Moody’s business could be significantly impacted. Factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this
regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest, the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities, the timing and nature of changes in rat-


MOODY’S

2016 10K


ings, a major compliance failure, negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings, regulators and legislative bodies, including as to the ratings process and its
implementation with respect to one or more securities and intentional or unintentional misrepresentations of Moody’s products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications.
Operational errors, whether by Moody’s or a Moody’s competitor, could also harm the reputation of the Company or the credit rating industry. Damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on Moody’s
business, operating results and financial condition.

The Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies May Negatively Impact the Nature
and Economics of the Company’s Business.

The markets for credit ratings, research, credit risk management services, research and analytical services and
financial training and certification services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, changes in client demands, and evolving regulatory requirements, industry standards and market preferences. The ability to develop
and successfully launch and maintain innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Moody’s competitors include
both established companies with significant financial resources, brand recognition, market experience and technological expertise, and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer
requirements. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods
currently employed by Moody’s, or may position, price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by Moody’s. Moody’s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers; these
indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, customers or others may develop alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk. Such developments could affect demand for Moody’s products and
services and its growth prospects. Further, the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive Internet information may reduce the demand for Moody’s products and services. For example, in December 2016, the ESMA
launched a database providing access to free, current information on certain credit ratings and rating outlooks. Moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by Moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital
infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by
competitors. Any inability of Moody to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.

The
Company Has a Significant Amount of Intangible Assets.

At December 31, 2016, Moody’s had $1,023.6 million of goodwill and $296.4 million of
intangible assets on its balance sheet. Approximately 73% of these intangibles reside in the MA business and are allocated to the four reporting units within MA: RD&A; ERS; Financial Services Training and Certifications; and Moody’s
Analytics Knowledge Services. The remaining 27% of these intangibles reside in MIS and primarily relate to ICRA. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in an asset impairment
charge, which would result in a non-cash charge to operating expenses. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may
have occurred. Determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil, and requires significant management estimates and judgment. In addition, the potential for
goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty. An asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

Possible Loss of Key Employees and Related Compensation Cost Pressures May Negatively Impact the Company.

Moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for
skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment
mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries. As greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies, in the future, Moody’s may be required to
alter its compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees. Investment banks, investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions
or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to
perform sophisticated credit analysis. There is a risk that even if the Company invests significant resources in attempting to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, it will not succeed in its efforts, and its business could be harmed.

Moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr., the President and Chief Executive Officer, and other senior officers and key
employees. The loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and Moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material
adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

Moody’s Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other Strategic Transactions May Not Produce Anticipated Results.

Moody’s has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, dispositions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen its business and
grow the Company. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks. The market for acquisition targets, dispositions and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect
Moody’s ability to complete such transactions. If Moody’s is unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, its business, operating results and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

If such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth, synergies and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully
realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. Any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks, including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations, technologies
and new employees; the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the Company prior to closing a transaction; unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures; scrutiny from competition and
antitrust authorities; failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business; diverting management’s focus from other business operations; and failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger
public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies. The anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize
than expected. As a result, the failure of acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company’s Compliance and Risk Management Programs May Not be Effective and May Result in Outcomes That Could Adversely Affect the Company’s
Reputation, Financial Condition and Operating Results.

Moody’s operates in a number of countries, and as a result the Company is required to comply with
numerous international and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The Company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws, is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of
compliance, review and reporting systems, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel. Moody’s policies and procedures to identify, evaluate and manage the Company’s risks may not be
fully effective, and Moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct, fraud or other errors. It is not always possible to deter such errors, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in
all cases. If Moody’s employees violate its policies or if the Company’s risk management methods are not effective, the Company could be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of the Company’s employees, fines,
penalties, regulatory sanctions, injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets or other penalties, and may suffer harm to its reputation, financial condition and operating results.

Legal Protections for the Company’s Intellectual Property Rights may not be Sufficient or Available to Protect the Company’s Competitive Advantages.

Moody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary. Failure to protect the Company’s intellectual property adequately
could harm its reputation and affect the Company’s ability to compete effectively. Businesses the Company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges the Company faces in protecting its strategic
advantage. In addition, the Company’s operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. On
January 6, 2015, a rule with direct relevance to the CRA industry was published in the Official Journal of the European Union regarding the types of information that CRAs are to provide about certain ratings (those that were paid for by
issuers) for publication on a central website administered by ESMA (the European Ratings Platform). This rule directly relates to the Company’s intellectual property as it requires that the Company provide proprietary information at no cost
that the Company currently sells, which could result in lost revenue. ESMA launched the European Rating Platform for public use on December 1, 2016.

Unauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the Company regards as proprietary. It is also possible that Moody’s
competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that Moody’s offers, and attempt to require Moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to modify or redesign the
products or services to avoid infringing, or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services. Even if Moody’s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property
rights through litigation, it may require considerable cost, time and resources to do so, and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. These risks, and the cost, time and resources needed to address them, may increase as the
Company’s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the United States.

The Company is Dependent on the Use of Third-Party Software, Data, Hosted Solutions, Data Centers, and Network Infrastructure

Technology providers to deliver and support reliable products, enhance their current products, develop new products

on a timely and cost-effective basis, and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. The Third Party Technology Moody’s uses may become obsolete, incompatible
with future versions of the Company’s products, unavailable or fail to operate effectively, and Moody’s business could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to timely or effectively replace such Third Party Technology. The Company
also monitors its use of Third Party Technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements. Despite the Company’s efforts, the Company cannot ensure that such third parties will permit Moody’s use in the future,
resulting in increased Third Party Technology acquisition costs and loss of rights. In addition, the Company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for Third Party Technology increase or the efforts to incorporate
enhancements to Third Party Technology are substantial. Some of these third-party suppliers are also Moody’s competitors, increasing the risks noted above. If any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Changes in Tax Rates or Tax Rules Could Affect Future Results.

As a global company, Moody’s is subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine
worldwide tax liabilities. Moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors, including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where we face
higher tax rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the tax, accounting and other laws, treaties, regulations, policies and
administrative practices, or changes to their interpretation or enforcement, including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development and the European Union’s state aid rulings, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Moody’s is subject to regular examination of our income
tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and we have experienced increased scrutiny as business has grown. Moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, however, developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect us. Although we believe our tax estimates and accruals are reasonable, there can be no
assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

The Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2016 consisted of approximately $1.7 billion
located outside of the U.S. Except as required under U.S. tax laws, Moody’s does not provide for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed
earnings indefinitely in our foreign operations. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we may be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate
could be adversely affected.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

This MD&A contains Forward-Looking Statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” commencing on page 55 and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” commencing
on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.

THE COMPANY

Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit, capital markets and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) software
solutions and related risk management services, (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, financial services training and certification services and (v) research and analytical services. Moody’s has two reportable segments: MIS and MA.

MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide.
Revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations which consist
primarily of the distribution of research and financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA’s non-ratings revenue. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not
material to the results of the MIS segment.

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management
activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies
and commentary on topical credit-related events. The RD&A business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores. Within its ERS business, MA provides software solutions as well as
related risk management services. The PS business provides research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other
retirement benefits, UTBs and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on
management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.

Pursuant to ASC Topic 605, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price
which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

The Company’s products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under ASC Topic 605. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an
arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right
relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. In instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined
with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.


MOODY’S

2016 10K


The Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the VSOE criteria by using the price
charged for a deliverable when sold separately or, if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority to establish such a price. In instances where the Company is not able to
establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history,
the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. However, due to
the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or
customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASC Topic 605, when the Company
is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best
estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related
product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis
or more frequently as needed.

In the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued. Revenue
attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, structured credit, international
residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities, which was
approximately 25 years on a weighted average basis at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $133 million, $121 million, and $107 million.

Multiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. In instances where monitoring
fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The Company generally uses ESP in
determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings.

MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding.
Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
accounts receivable included approximately $25 million, $24 million, and $22 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual
billings. Furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period. At December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, accounts
receivable included approximately $159.1 million, $146.4 million, and $127.8 million, respectively, relating to accrued monitoring service revenue.

In the MA
segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain
software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at
the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs. Software
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed. A large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual
software maintenance are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.

Products and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or
together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the
relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.

If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each
software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to determine VSOE for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the

MOODY’S

2016 10K



residual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an undelivered element, the Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the
Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements. In cases where software implementation services are considered essential and VSOE of fair value exists for post-contract customer support
(“PCS”), once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as implementation services are performed, while PCS is recognized over the coverage
period. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for PCS, once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete, at which point total remaining
arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining PCS coverage period. If VSOE does not exist for PCS at the beginning of an arrangement but is established during implementation, revenue not recognized due to the absence of VSOE will be
recognized on a cumulative basis.

Accounts Receivable Allowance

Moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions.
Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual billing
adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and invoice adjustment experience as well as the current
aging status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody’s adjusts its
allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to
the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual
write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

Contingencies

Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of
judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial
statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where
deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.

For
claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within
the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In other instances, where a loss is reasonably possible, management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range
of loss, but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of
litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the
matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters
may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest
information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence
of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.

The Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the Company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation,
employment practices litigation, employee medical claims and terrorism, for which the claims are not material to the Company. In addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the Company for defense costs related to
professional liability claims. For matters insured by the Company’s insurance subsidiary, Moody’s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its
anticipated conclusion. The Company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as


MOODY’S

2016 10K


well as actuarially determined estimates. Defense costs for matters not

self-insured

by the Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary are expensed
as services are provided.

For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine
whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have
full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective
settlement with a taxing authority.

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

On July 31 of each year, Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an
operating segment.

The Company has six primary reporting units: two within the Company’s ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses
all of Moody’s other ratings operations) and four reporting units within MA: RD&A, ERS, FSTC and MAKS. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings
process, in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The ERS reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and
regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry. These products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold
on a subscription basis. The FSTC reporting unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and implementation services. The MAKS reporting unit, formerly known as
Copal Amba, provides research and analytical services. Copal Amba was renamed Moody’s Analytics Knowledge Services in December 2016.

The Company evaluates the
recoverability of goodwill using a three-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its
carrying amount. If a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding
that it is more

likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined
and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing.
If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill
is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value,
the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions or realignments. For the
reporting units where the Company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the Company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment
at least once every three years. At July 31, 2016, the Company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on all reporting units, which resulted in no impairment of goodwill.

In January 2017 there was a management change in the MAKS business. As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, a new operating and strategic plan for this reporting
unit under the new management structure has not yet been completed. Based on all available information, the Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the MAKS reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount
at December 31, 2016. A quantitative impairment assessment for the MAKS reporting unit will be performed in the first quarter of 2017 upon the completion of revised financial projections under the new management structure which could result in
a reduced fair value as compared to the July 31, 2016 fair value.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived acquired intangible
asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and
market conditions, and appropriate comparable market metrics. However, as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, actual future results may differ from these estimates. In addition, the Company also makes certain
judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.

Other assets and liabilities,
including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.

Methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining of the fair value of reporting units:

The following is a discussion regarding the Company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding ICRA, as of July 31, 2016,
the date of each reporting unit’s last quantitative assessment. As ICRA is a publicly traded company in India, the Company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization.

The fair value of each reporting unit, excluding ICRA, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction
multiples. The DCF analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that is based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal
values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could result in an
impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit
expected to benefit from the acquisition.

The sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and WACC assumptions described below are as of July 31, 2016. The
following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment:

»

Future cash flow assumptions

—The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting
unit. These projections are consistent with the Company’s operating and strategic plan. Cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis were utilized in the determination of the fair value
of each reporting unit. The growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets, new customer acquisition and new products. Beyond five years, a terminal value was determined
using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real GDP growth rates. A sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units. For all reporting units, a 10% decrease in the revenue growth rates used would not
have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value.

»

WACC

—The WACC is the rate used to discount each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows. The WACC is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of
equity is based on a risk-free interest rate, an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit’s cash flows.
The cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the Company’s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the WACC. The cost of debt and
equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. The WACC for all reporting units ranged from 8.5% to 11.5% as of July 31, 2016. Differences
in the WACC used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. A sensitivity analysis of the WACC was performed on all reporting units as of July 31, 2016
for each reporting unit. For all reporting units, an increase in the WACC of one percentage point would not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value.

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There
were no such events or changes during 2016 that would indicate that the carrying amount of

amortizable intangible assets in any of the Company’s reporting units may not be recoverable. This determination was made based on continued growth, consistent with operating and strategic
plans for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides.

Pension and Other Retirement Benefits

The expenses, assets and liabilities that Moody’s reports for its Retirement Plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and
circumstances. These significant assumptions include the following:

»

future compensation increases, based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook;

»

long-term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of
equity and fixed-income investments); and

»

discount rates, based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.

The discount rates selected to measure
the present value of the Company’s benefit obligation for its Retirement Plans as of December 31, 2016 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with
the corresponding yield on the Citibank pension discount curve. The cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.

Moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the
Company consults with third-party actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a
significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s Retirement Plans. Additionally, the Company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale MP-2016 to accompany
the RP-2014 mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the Society of Actuaries.

When actual plan experience
differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. Excluding differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets, the Company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense,
total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related
value of plan assets. For Moody’s Retirement Plans, the total actuarial losses as of December 31, 2016 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $130.3 million, and Moody’s expects to recognize a net periodic expense of $9.8
million in 2017 related to the amortization of actuarial losses.

For Moody’s funded U.S. pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of
return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under ASC Topic 715, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market-related
value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has an unrecognized
asset loss of $7.7 million, of which $1.5 million will be recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2018 expense.

The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody’s 2017 operating income. These
effects have been calculated using the Company’s current projections of 2017 expenses, assets and liabilities related to Moody’s Retirement Plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company
records compensation expense for all share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes stock options and restricted stock. The fair value of each stock
option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the

Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moody’s experience during the
period since becoming a public company. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income
taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions. The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary
differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.

The Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness
of liabilities for UTBs. The Company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non-operating expenses.

For UTBs, ASC Topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax
position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not
threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of liabilities related to UTBs and associated
interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the
Company’s operating results or financial condition.

For certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, the Company has deemed the undistributed earnings relating to
these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations. Accordingly, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. It is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred
taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

Other Estimates

In addition, there are other accounting estimates within
Moody’s consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions
and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected
in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact Moody’s.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

The Company is organized into
two reportable segments at December 31, 2016: MIS and MA.

The MIS segment is comprised primarily of all of the Company’s ratings operations. The MIS
segment consists of five lines of business – CFG, SFG, FIG, PPIF and MIS Other. The ratings LOBs generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue
such obligations in markets worldwide. The MIS Other LOB consists of certain non-ratings operations managed by MIS which consists of non-rating revenue from ICRA as well as certain research and financial instruments pricing service operations in the
Asia-Pacific region.


MOODY’S

2016 10K


The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities
of institutional participants in global financial markets. The MA segment consists of three lines of business – RD&A, ERS and PS.

The following is a
discussion of the results of operations of the Company and its reportable segments. Total MIS revenue and total MA expenses include the intersegment royalty revenue for MIS and expense charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data
and products developed by MIS. The royalty rate charged by MIS approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content, data and products developed by MIS. Total MA revenue and total MIS expenses include intersegment fees charged to MIS from MA
for the use of certain MA products and services in MIS’s ratings process. These fees charged by MA are generally equal to the costs incurred by MA to provide these products and services. Overhead charges and corporate expenses which exclusively
benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company which benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. Accordingly, a
reportable segment’s share of these costs will increase as its proportion of revenue relative to Moody’s total revenue increases. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as
finance, human resources and information technology.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015

Executive Summary

»

Moody’s revenue in 2016 totaled $3,604.2 million, an increase of $119.7 million, or 3%, compared to 2015 reflecting good growth in MA revenue coupled with modest growth in MIS revenue.

»

MIS revenue was 2% higher compared to the prior year reflecting robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as for public finance related activity in the second half of 2016. The
growth also reflected benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were mostly offset by challenges in the first half of 2016 in the high-yield and investment-grade corporate debt sectors
due to elevated credit spreads and market volatility. Additionally, there was lower securitization activity in the U.S. in the first half of 2016, most notably in the U.S. CLO and CMBS asset classes, which reflected the aforementioned elevated
credit spreads and market volatility as well as uncertainty relating to the implementation of risk retention regulatory requirements for these asset classes.

»

MA revenue grew 7% compared to the prior year reflecting growth in ERS and RD&A, most notably in the U.S. Revenue grew in most product areas of ERS and included revenue from the acquisition of GGY. In RD&A,
revenue growth was primarily driven by credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, MA revenue grew 10%.

»

Total operating expenses increased $954.4 million or 47%, reflecting:

»

an $863.8 million Settlement Charge relating to the MIS segment pursuant to an agreement with the DOJ and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia more fully discussed in Note 19,
“Contingencies” within Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K;

»

higher compensation costs of $88.1 million associated with headcount growth in MA (including costs from the acquisition of GGY) and annual compensation increases company-wide partially offset by cost reduction
initiatives in response to the challenging business conditions in MIS during the first half of 2016; and

»

a restructuring charge of $12.0 million associated with cost management initiatives in the MIS segment as well as in certain corporate overhead functions.

»

Operating income of $638.7 million in 2016, which included the aforementioned $863.8 million Settlement Charge, was down $834.7 million compared to 2015 and resulted in an operating margin of 17.7%, compared to 42.3% in
the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income of $1,641.2 million in 2016 was up modestly compared to 2015, while Adjusted Operating Margin of 45.5% remained flat compared to 2015.

»

The change in non-operating income (expense) net, compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher FX gains which included an approximate $35 million gain related to the liquidation of a non-U.S. subsidiary and an
approximate $15 million gain relating to the appreciation of the euro relative to the British pound during 2016. Partially offsetting these increases was higher interest expense reflecting the 2015 Senior Notes issued in March 2015 and the $300
million of additional borrowings under the 2014 Senior Notes (30-Year) in November 2015.

»

The ETR was 50.6% in 2016 compared to 31.2% in the prior year with the increase primarily reflecting the non-deductible nature of the federal portion of the aforementioned Settlement Charge.

Diluted EPS of $1.36 in 2016, which included: i) a $3.59 Settlement Charge; ii) a $0.04 restructuring charge and iii) an $0.18 FX gain relating to the substantial liquidation of a subsidiary, decreased $3.27 compared to
2015. Excluding all of the aforementioned items in 2016 and a $0.03 benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter in the prior year, Adjusted Diluted EPS of $4.81 in 2016 increased $0.21.

Global revenue of $3,604.2 million in 2016 increased $119.7 million, or 3%, compared to 2015 and reflected good growth in MA revenue,
which included revenue from the first quarter 2016 acquisition of GGY, coupled with modest growth in MIS revenue.

The $36.6 million increase in MIS revenue reflected
robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as for public finance related activity in the second half of 2016 reflecting both opportunistic refinancing and new issuance

activity. The growth also reflected benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were mostly offset by
challenges in the first half of 2016 in the high-yield and investment-grade corporate debt sectors due

to elevated credit spreads and market volatility. Additionally, there was lower securitization activity in the U.S. in the first half of 2016, most notably in the U.S. CLO and CMBS asset classes,
which reflected the aforementioned elevated credit spreads and market volatility as well as uncertainty earlier in the year relating to the implementation of certain risk retention regulatory requirements by the end of 2016 for these asset classes.

The $83.1 million increase in MA revenue reflects growth in ERS and RD&A, most notably in the U.S. Revenue grew in most product areas of ERS and included revenue
from the 2016 acquisition of GGY. In RD&A, revenue growth was primarily driven by credit research, subscriptions and licensing of ratings data partially offset by the impact of unfavorable changes in FX rates. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX
translation rates, MA revenue grew 10%.

Transaction revenue accounted for 49% of global MCO revenue in 2016 compared 50% of global MCO revenue in 2015.

U.S. revenue of $2,105.5 million in 2016 increased $96.5 million over the prior year, reflecting strong growth in MA coupled with modest growth in MIS.

Non-U.S. revenue increased $23.2 million from 2015 reflecting modest growth in both reportable segments.

Operating expenses were $1,026.6 million in 2016 up $50.3 million from 2015 and included an increase in compensation costs of approximately $71 million. This increase
reflects higher salaries and employee benefit expenses resulting from the impact of annual compensation increases and headcount growth in MA which includes headcount from the acquisition of GGY. The increase in compensation expenses also reflects
higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement relative to targeted results compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by an approximate $21 million decrease in non-compensation expenses reflecting cost reduction
initiatives in response to challenging business conditions in MIS earlier in the year.

SG&A expenses of $936.4 million in 2016 increased $15.1 million from the
prior year period reflecting higher compensation costs primarily due to annual compensation increases company-wide and headcount growth in MA which included headcount from the GGY acquisition. The increase in compensation expenses also reflects
higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement relative to targeted results compared to the prior year. Additionally, there was an increase in non-compensation expenses reflecting higher rent and occupancy costs being mostly offset by
the impact of cost reduction initiatives in response to challenging business conditions in MIS earlier in the year.

The restructuring charge of $12.0 million relates
to cost management initiatives in 2016 in the MIS segment as well as in certain corporate overhead functions.

D&A increased $13.2 million reflecting amortization
of intangible assets from acquisitions as well as higher depreciation reflecting an increase in capital expenditures to support IT infrastructure and business growth.

The $863.8 million Settlement Charge relates to an agreement with the U.S. DOJ and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia to resolve pending
and potential civil claims related to the MIS segment as more fully discussed in Note 19, “Contingencies” within Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

Operating income of $638.7 million in 2016, which included the aforementioned $863.8 million Settlement Charge, was down $834.7 million compared to 2015 and resulted in
an operating margin of 17.7%, compared to 42.3% in the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income of $1,641.2 million in 2016 was up modestly compared to 2015, while Adjusted Operating Margin of 45.5% remained flat compared to 2015.

Interest expense, net in 2016 was ($137.8) million, a $22.7 million increase in expense compared to 2015 reflecting interest on the 2015 Senior Notes which were issued in
March 2015 as well as interest on the $300 million of additional borrowings under the 2014 Senior Notes (30-Year) in November 2015.

Other non-operating income, net
was $57.1 million in 2016, a $35.8 million increase in income compared to 2015. This increase reflected FX gains of approximately $35 million related to the substantial liquidation of a subsidiary and approximately $15 million of gains relating to
the appreciation of the euro relative to the British pound during 2016. FX gains in 2015 were immaterial. This increase in income was partially offset by a $6.4 million benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter in 2015 compared to a $1.6 million benefit in
2016.

The ETR was 50.6% in 2016 compared to 31.2% in the prior year with the increase primarily reflecting the non-deductible nature of the federal portion of the
aforementioned Settlement Charge.

Net Income in 2016, which included an approximate $701 million net Settlement Charge more fully described above, was $266.6
million, or $674.7 million lower than prior year. Diluted EPS of $1.36 in 2016, which included: i) a $3.59 Settlement Charge; ii) a $0.04 restructuring charge and iii) an $0.18 FX gain relating to the substantial liquidation of a subsidiary,
decreased $3.27 compared to 2015. Excluding all of the aforementioned items in 2016 and a $0.03 benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter in the prior year, Adjusted Diluted EPS of $4.81 in 2016 increased $0.21 primarily reflecting lower diluted weighted
average shares outstanding. The reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding reflects share repurchases under the Company’s Board authorized share repurchase program partially offset by shares issued under the employee stock-based
compensation programs.

The following is a discussion of external MIS revenue and operating expenses:

Global MIS revenue of $2,370.8 million in 2016 was up 2% compared to 2015 reflecting robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt, bank loans and public
finance in the second half of 2016 as capital market volatility and elevated credit spreads that hindered issuance in the first half of 2016 subsided. Additionally, the growth reflects the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee
initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were mostly offset by challenges in the first half of 2016 in both the speculative-grade and investment-grade corporate debt sectors due to elevated credit spreads and market volatility at the time
coupled with an unfavorable shift in issuance mix for investment-grade corporate debt. Additionally, there was lower securitization activity in the U.S. in the first half of 2016, primarily in the U.S. CLO and CMBS asset classes, which reflected the
aforementioned elevated credit spreads and market volatility as well as uncertainty earlier in the year relating to the December 2016 implementation deadline for certain risk retention regulatory requirements for these asset classes.

Transaction revenue for MIS was 61% in both 2016 and 2015.

In the U.S., revenue was
$1,501.9 million in 2016, an increase of $27.6 million compared to 2015 and reflected benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases coupled with second half of 2016 growth in rated issuance volumes for
high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as strong public finance issuance. These increases were partially offset by lower rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt in the first half of 2016 and a decline in investment-grade
corporate debt rated issuance volumes which was most notable in the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, there were declines in securitization activity in the CLO and CMBS asset classes within SFG in the first half of 2016.

Non-U.S. revenue was $868.9 million in 2016, an increase of $9.0 million compared to 2015 primarily reflecting second half of 2016 growth in high-yield corporate debt and
bank loans as well as investment-grade corporate debt. This growth in the second half reflected improved market sentiment following volatility in the first half of 2016 as well as the ECB sponsored CSPP providing a ballast to corporate debt issuance
in the EMEA region. The growth over the prior year also reflects changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue in the first half of 2016 primarily reflecting
declines in investment-grade and high-yield corporate debt across all regions.


MOODY’S

2016 10K


Global CFG revenue of $1,122.3 million in 2016 was up 1% compared to 2015. The increase reflects benefits from changes in
the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases coupled with robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans in the U.S. and EMEA in the second half of 2016 as capital market volatility and elevated credit
spreads that hindered issuance in the first half of 2016 subsided. The increase also reflects higher investment-grade rated issuance volumes in EMEA in the second half of 2016 reflecting additional liquidity in the region resulting from the ECB
sponsored CSPP. These increases were partially offset by lower rated issuance volumes in the first half of 2016 for investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate debt across all regions due to elevated credit spreads and capital market volatility
at the time. Also, there were lower U.S. investment-grade rated issuance volumes in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflecting an increase in benchmark interest rates immediately following the U.S. presidential election in November. Transaction revenue
represented 68% of total CFG revenue in 2016, compared to 69% in the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue in 2016 was $762.9 million, or $10.0 million higher than the prior year. Internationally, revenue of $359.4 million in the 2016 was flat
compared to the prior year.

Global SFG revenue of $436.8 million in 2016 decreased $12.3 million, or 3%, compared to 2015. In the U.S., revenue of $293.3 million
decreased $18.2 million compared to 2015. This decrease primarily reflected lower CLO formation in the first half of 2016 due to elevated credit spreads and declining availability of collateral for these instruments earlier in the year.
Additionally, the decrease reflected lower securitization activity in the CMBS asset class reflecting higher average credit spreads over the course of 2016, particularly in the first quarter, as well as uncertainties relating to the implementation
of certain risk retention regulatory requirements for this asset class. These declines were partially offset by benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. Non-U.S. revenue in 2016 of $143.5 million
increased $5.9 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth in RMBS and ABS in EMEA. Transaction revenue was 62% of total SFG revenue in 2016 compared to 64% in the prior year.

Global FIG revenue of $368.9 million in 2016 increased $3.3 million, or 1%, compared to 2015. In the U.S., revenue of $160.1 million increased $3.7 million compared to
the prior year primarily reflecting benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as higher M&A related issuance volumes in the insurance sector. These increases were partially offset by reduced
banking-related issuance volumes due to market volatility in the first half of 2016. Internationally, revenue was $208.8 million in 2016, or flat compared to 2015 with benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing
increases and growth in the Asia-Pacific region reflecting higher cross-border issuance from Chinese banks and asset managers being offset by declines in banking-related issuance in EMEA. Transaction revenue was 37% of total FIG revenue in both 2016
and 2015.

Global PPIF revenue was $412.2 million in 2016 and increased $35.8 million, or 10%, compared to 2015. In the U.S., revenue in 2016 was $276.2 million and
increased $31.5 million compared to 2015 primarily due to benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as strong growth in public finance issuance in the second half of 2016. This growth in issuance
reflects opportunistic refunding activity amidst favorable market conditions as well as higher new issuance volumes to fund municipal infrastructure investment needs. Additionally, the growth in the U.S. reflects higher infrastructure finance
revenue. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue was $136.0 million and increased $4.3 million compared to 2015 reflecting benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as higher infrastructure finance
revenue in the Americas region. These increases were partially offset by lower project finance revenue across all non-U.S. regions. Transaction revenue was 63% of total PPIF revenue in 2016 compared to 60% in the prior year.

Global MIS Other revenue of $30.6 million in 2016 was flat compared to 2015.

Operating
and SG&A expenses in 2016 decreased $5.1 million compared to 2015 primarily reflecting lower non-compensation costs of approximately $25 million reflecting overall cost control initiatives. This decrease was partially offset by higher
compensation expenses of approximately $20 million compared to the prior year reflecting annual salary increases coupled with higher incentive compensation costs resulting from higher achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the
prior year.

The increase in D&A compared to the prior year reflects capital expenditures related to investments in the Company’s IT and operational
infrastructure.

The restructuring charge in 2016 relates to cost management initiatives in the MIS segment as well as in certain corporate overhead functions.

The Settlement Charge is pursuant to an agreement with the DOJ and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia as more fully discussed in Note
19, “Contingencies” within Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

Adjusted Operating Income was $1,355.4 million and increased $48.0 million
compared to the prior year. Operating income in 2016, which includes the aforementioned $863.8 million Settlement Charge, was $407.6 million and decreased $833.8 million compared to the prior year. Adjusted Operating Margin was 54.9% or 100 BPS
higher than the prior year. Operating margin was 16.5% in 2016 compared to 51.1% in the prior year, with the decline primarily due to the aforementioned Settlement Charge. Adjusted Operating Income and operating income both include intersegment
revenue and expense.

The following is a discussion of external MA revenue and operating expenses:

Global MA revenue increased $83.1 million, or 7%, compared to 2015 and reflected growth in RD&A as well as ERS, which included revenue from the acquisition of GGY.
Additionally, the growth over the prior year reflects benefits from pricing increases within MA’s recurring revenue base. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX rates, MA revenue grew 10% compared to the prior year. Recurring revenue comprised 75%
and 74% of total MA revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

In the U.S., revenue of $603.6 million in 2016 increased $68.9 million, and reflected growth in RD&A
and ERS. The growth in RD&A reflected strength in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data as well as higher revenue within SAV and ECCA. The increase in ERS revenue reflected growth across all product verticals and included
revenue from the acquisition of GGY in March 2016.

Non-U.S. revenue of $629.8 million in 2016 was $14.2 million higher than in 2015 reflecting growth in RD&A and
ERS partially offset by unfavorable changes in FX rates. The growth in RD&A primarily reflects strength in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data in the Asia-Pacific region. The increase in ERS was primarily due to higher
revenue from the Assets Liability & Capital and Credit Assessment & Origination product verticals in the EMEA region coupled with revenue from the acquisition of GGY. These increases were partially offset by declines in the Credit
Assessment & Origination product vertical in the Americas region.

Global RD&A revenue of $667.6 million, which comprised 54% of total external MA
revenue in both 2016 and 2015, increased $41.2 million, or 7%, over the prior year period. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX rates, RD&A revenue increased 9% over the prior year. The growth reflected strength in credit research subscriptions
and licensing of ratings data as well as higher revenue within SAV and ECCA. The growth compared to 2015 also reflects the benefits of pricing increases. In the U.S., revenue of $389.3 million increased $37.4 million compared to 2015. Non-U.S.
revenue of $278.3 million increased $3.8 million compared to the prior year.

Global ERS revenue of $418.8 million in 2016 increased $44.8 million, or 12%, over 2015.
Excluding unfavorable changes in FX rates, ERS revenue grew 15% reflecting increases across most product offerings and included revenue from the acquisition of GGY in March of 2016. Additionally, the revenue growth reflects benefits from pricing
increases within ERS’s recurring revenue base. Revenue in ERS is subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of software implementation and license revenue in a relatively small
number of engagements. In the U.S., revenue of $162.9 million increased $31.7 million compared to the prior year. Non-U.S. revenue of $255.9 million increased $13.1 million compared to the prior year.


MOODY’S

2016 10K


Global PS revenue of $147.0 million in 2016 decreased $2.9 million, or 2%, from 2015. Excluding the unfavorable impact from
changes in FX translation rates, PS revenue was flat compared to the prior year. In the U.S. and internationally revenue was $51.4 million and $95.6 million, respectively, or flat and down 3%, respectively.

The increase in D&A compared to the prior year reflects capital expenditures related to investments in the Company’s IT and operational infrastructure as well as
amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2016 increased $70.5 million compared to 2015. The expense growth primarily reflects
an approximate $68 million increase in compensation costs primarily due to higher headcount to support business growth as well as headcount from the acquisition of GGY coupled with annual merit increases.

Adjusted Operating Income was $285.8 million in 2016 and increased $6.3 million compared to the same period in 2015. Operating income of $231.1 million in 2016 decreased
$0.9 million compared to the same period in 2015. Adjusted Operating Margin in 2016 was 22.9%, down 110bps from 2015. Operating margin was 18.5% in 2016, down 140bps from the prior year. Operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin in 2016 were
suppressed due to a larger proportion of overhead costs allocated to MA under the Company’s revenue-split methodology. Adjusted operating income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year ended December 31, 2015 compared with year
ended December 31, 2014

Executive Summary

»

Moody’s revenue in 2015 totaled $3,484.5 million, an increase of $150.2 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. Excluding the unfavorable impact of changes in FX translation rates, primarily due to the strengthening of
the U.S. dollar to the euro, British pound and Canadian dollar, revenue increased 9% over the prior year reflecting growth in both reportable segments despite challenging market conditions in 2015. The following discussion of MIS and MA revenue
excludes intersegment revenue.

»

MIS revenue was 3% higher compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact from unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, MIS revenue grew 8% over the prior year. This growth primarily reflects benefits from changes
in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases as well as increases in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt. Additionally, higher U.S. PFG refunding volumes and higher U.S. banking-related issuance
contributed to the growth. Furthermore, there were increases across most SFG asset classes in the U.S. and EMEA, as well as revenue from the ICRA Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by declines in bank loan revenue in the U.S. and
EMEA, lower speculative-grade corporate debt revenue in EMEA and an approximate $102 million unfavorable impact due to changes in FX rates.

»

MA revenue grew 8% compared to the prior year reflecting growth in ERS and RD&A partially offset by declines in PS. Excluding the impact from unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, MA revenue grew 12%. Revenue
growth in ERS was primarily due to increases across most product offerings with particular strength in the credit assessment and origination business. Additionally, the acquisition of WebEquity in the third quarter of 2014 also contributed to ERS
growth. In RD&A, revenue growth was primarily driven by credit research and licensing of ratings data as well as revenue from the acquisition of Lewtan. The decline in PS reflected the Company’s exiting certain Copal Amba product lines late
in 2014 as well as attrition outpacing sales growth at Copal Amba. The 2015 MA revenue included an unfavorable impact of approximately $47 million due to unfavorable changes in FX translation rates.

»

Total expenses increased $115.9 million compared to the prior year reflecting:

»

higher compensation costs of approximately $59 million primarily relating to headcount growth and annual compensation increases. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in incentive compensation reflecting
lower achievement against full-year targeted results in 2015 compared to 2014.

»

non-compensation expenses increased approximately $39 million compared to 2014 reflecting higher costs related to the Company’s investment in IT and other operational infrastructure and higher rent and occupancy
costs. Additionally, the increase reflects higher variable costs correlated with business growth.

»

higher D&A of $17.9 million reflecting amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions as well as higher depreciation reflecting an increase in capital expenditures to support IT infrastructure and business
growth.

»

The increase in both compensation and non-compensation expenses reflects operating costs from the 2014 acquisitions of ICRA, WebEquity and Lewtan.

»

Operating income of $1,473.4 million increased $34.3 million compared to 2014 and resulted in an operating margin of 42.3%
compared to 43.2% in the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income of $1,586.9 million in 2015 increased $52.2 million compared to 2014, resulting in an Adjusted Operating Margin of 45.5% compared to 46.0% in the prior year period. The decrease in
margins is

MOODY’S

2016 10K



due to continued investment in the Company’s operations, the acquisition of companies that operate at a margin below Moody’s historical margin as well as the impact of FX translation.
Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates negatively impacted operating income and Adjusted Operating Income by approximately $76 million and $79 million, respectively.

»

Non-operating income (expense), net was ($93.8) million compared to net non-operating income of $21.9 million in 2014. The change reflects the $102.8 million ICRA Gain in the prior year and smaller FX gains in 2015.

»

The ETR remained flat compared to 2014. The 2015 ETR includes a benefit relating to a state tax ruling and a change in local tax law relating to income apportionment as well as the resolution of certain domestic and
international tax matters. The 2014 ETR reflects a benefit from the favorable resolution of an international tax matter.

»

Diluted EPS of $4.63 in 2015, which included a $0.03 benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter, increased $0.02 over 2014, which included $0.37 for the ICRA Gain as well as a $0.03 benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter. Excluding the
benefit from the Legacy Tax Matter in both years as well as the ICRA Gain in 2014, Adjusted Diluted EPS in 2015 of $4.60 was $0.39 higher than 2014 Adjusted Diluted EPS of $4.21. The increase in both diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS benefited
from a 5.3% reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to treasury share repurchases under the Company’s Board authorized share repurchase program partially offset by shares issued under the employee stock-based compensation
programs.

Global revenue of $3,484.5 million in 2015 increased $150.2 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. Excluding the unfavorable impact from
changes in FX translation rates, global revenue increased 9% compared to prior year and reflected growth in both reportable segments. Transaction revenue accounted for 50% of global MCO revenue in both 2015 and 2014.

The MIS revenue increase reflected changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, primarily in the U.S., coupled with growth in rated
issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt and higher U.S. PFG refunding volumes. The growth also reflects increases across all asset classes within SFG and higher banking revenue coupled with revenue from the ICRA Acquisition. These
increases were partially offset by an approximate $102 million unfavorable impact due to changes in FX rates as well as declines in rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans.

The growth in MA reflects higher revenue in RD&A and ERS partially offset by decreases in PS revenue. The increase in RD&A was primarily driven by growth from
sales of credit research and licensing of ratings data. The growth in ERS reflects increases in all product offerings, with particular strength in the credit assessment and origination business. The 2014 acquisitions of Lewtan and WebEquity also
contributed to growth in RD&A and ERS, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in MA was an approximate $47 million unfavorable impact due to changes in FX translation rates.

U.S. revenue of $2,009.0 million in 2015 increased $194.5 million over the prior year, reflecting changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing
increases within MIS, growth in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt, higher PFG refunding volumes and revenue increases in most asset classes in SFG. The growth also reflects increases across all MA LOBs. These increases were
partially offset by declines in bank loan rated issuance compared to the prior year.

Non-U.S. revenue decreased $44.3 million from 2014, reflecting an approximate
$146 million unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates coupled with declines in high-yield corporate debt and bank loan issuance in EMEA as well as a revenue decline in PS. These declines were partially offset by increases in RD&A
and ERS revenue in all regions within MA as well as growth across most asset classes within SFG in EMEA.

Operating expenses were $976.3 million in 2015 and increased
$46.0 million from 2014 due to an approximate $33 million and $13 million increase in compensation and non-compensation costs, respectively. The increase in compensation costs reflected higher expenses resulting from the impact of annual
compensation increases as well as higher headcount due to business growth and from acquisitions. Additionally, higher pension costs contributed to the compensation expense growth reflecting a lower discount rate used to measure expense and the use
of a new mortality table. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation reflecting lower achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year. The increase in non-compensation expenses reflected
higher costs to support various IT and other operational enhancement projects, higher variable costs to support business growth and expenses from the ICRA, WebEquity and Lewtan acquisitions in the second half of 2014. The changes above include a
favorable impact relating to changes in FX translation rates compared to the prior year.

SG&A expenses of $921.3 million in 2015 increased $52.0 million compared
to the prior year period reflecting higher compensation and non-compensation expenses of approximately $27 million and $25 million, respectively. The growth in compensation costs was primarily due to higher expenses resulting from annual
compensation increases, headcount growth in MIS and MA as well as in overhead support areas coupled with higher headcount from acquisitions. Additionally, higher pension costs contributed to the compensation expense growth reflecting a lower
discount rate used to measure expense and the use of a new mortality table. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation reflecting lower achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year. The
increase in non-compensation expenses reflects higher costs to support various IT and other operational enhancement projects as well as higher rent and occupancy costs reflecting various real estate projects worldwide. Additionally, the increase
reflects non-compensation expenses from the ICRA, WebEquity and Lewtan acquisitions in the second half of 2014. The increases above include a favorable impact relating to changes in FX translation rates compared to the prior year.

D&A increased $17.9 million reflecting amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions as well as higher depreciation reflecting an increase in capital
expenditures to support IT infrastructure and business growth.

Operating income of $1,473.4 million increased $34.3 million from 2014. Adjusted Operating Income was
$1,586.9 million in 2015 and increased $52.2 million compared to 2014. Operating margin decreased 90 BPS compared to 2014. Adjusted Operating Margin in 2015

MOODY’S

2016 10K



of 45.5% decreased 50 BPS compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin is primarily due to continued investment in the Company’s operations as
well as the acquisition of companies that operate at a margin below Moody’s historical margin and FX translation. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates negatively impacted operating income and Adjusted Operating Income by approximately
$76 million and $79 million, respectively.

Interest income (expense), net in 2015 was ($115.1) million, or flat compared to 2014 reflecting higher interest on
borrowings due to the issuance of the 2014 Senior Notes (5-Year) and 2014 Senior Notes (30-Year) in July 2014 as well as the issuance of the 2015 Senior Notes and additional issuance under the 2014 Senior Notes (30-Year) in 2015. These increases
were offset by $11 million in net costs (net of a gain on the termination of an interest rate swap) related to the early repayment of the Series 2005-1 Notes in 2014.

Other non-operating income (expense), net was $21.3 million in 2015, a $14.6 million decrease in income compared to 2014. The decrease primarily reflects FX gains of
$20.3 million in 2014 which was primarily due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound for certain U.S. dollar denominated assets held in international jurisdictions. The FX gains in 2015 were not significant.

The $102.8 million ICRA Gain related to a fair value remeasurement of the Company’s previously held equity investment in ICRA which occurred in connection with
Moody’s acquiring a controlling stake in ICRA on June 26, 2014.

The Company’s ETR was 31.2% in 2015, or flat compared to 2014. The 2015 ETR includes a
benefit relating to a state tax ruling and a change in local tax law relating to income apportionment as well as the resolution of certain domestic and international tax matters. The 2014 ETR reflects a benefit from the favorable resolution of an
international tax matter.

Net Income in 2015, which included a $6.4 million benefit related to the aforementioned Legacy Tax Matter, was $941.3 million, or $4.63 per
diluted share. This is a decrease of $47.4 million compared to 2014, which included $78.5 million for the ICRA Gain as well as a $6.4 million benefit related to a Legacy Tax Matter. However, Diluted EPS was up $0.02 reflecting benefits from a 5.3%
reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to treasury share repurchases under the Company’s Board authorized share repurchase program partially offset by shares issued under the employee stock-based compensation programs.
Excluding the $0.37 ICRA Gain in 2014 and benefits from Legacy Tax Matters in both years, Adjusted Diluted EPS of $4.60 in 2015 was $0.39 higher than Adjusted Diluted EPS of $4.21 in the prior year.

The following is a discussion of external MIS revenue and operating expenses:

Global MIS revenue of $2,334.2 million in 2015 increased $68.4 million, or 3%, compared to 2014. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, MIS revenue grew
8% over the prior year and reflected growth across all LOBs. Transaction revenue for MIS was 61% in both 2015 and 2014.

In the U.S., revenue was $1,474.3 million in
2015, an increase of $133.3 million compared to 2014 reflecting changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases coupled with growth in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt and higher public
finance refunding volumes. The increase also reflects growth across most asset classes in SFG coupled with higher banking revenue. These increases were partially offset by lower rated issuance volumes for bank loans compared to the prior year.

Non-U.S. revenue was $859.9 million in 2015, a decrease of $64.9 million compared to 2014. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, revenue grew 4% over the
prior year reflecting the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, higher investment-grade revenue in EMEA, growth across most asset classes within SFG in EMEA and revenue from the ICRA
Acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases was lower revenue from rating high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as lower indicative ratings revenue in the EMEA region. Additionally, there was an approximate $99 million unfavorable
impact relating to changes in FX translation rates.

Global CFG revenue of $1,112.7 million in 2015 was flat compared to 2014. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX
translation rates, revenue grew 4% over the prior year primarily due to the benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, primarily in the U.S. as well as higher rated issuance volumes for
investment-grade corporate debt in the U.S. The growth in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt, which was more pronounced in the first half of 2015, reflects an increase in M&A activity and continued favorable market
conditions for much of the year. Additionally, revenue from the ICRA Acquisition and higher monitoring fees reflecting growth in the number of outstanding rated issuances contributed to the increase over the prior year. These increases were
partially offset by a decline in bank loan issuance in the U.S. and EMEA as banks reduced supply to adhere more closely to the U.S. Shared National Credit Program regarding highly leveraged transactions. The increases were also partially offset by
declines in high-yield corporate debt across all non-U.S. regions reflecting widening credit spreads in this sector resulting from weak commodity prices coupled with current macroeconomic uncertainties in emerging markets. Additionally, there was an
approximate $41 million unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates compared to the prior year. Transaction revenue represented 69% of total CFG revenue in 2015, compared to 70% in the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue in 2015 was
$752.9 million, or $65.6 million higher than the prior year. Internationally, revenue of $359.8 million in the 2015 decreased $62.2 million compared to the prior year.

Global SFG revenue of $449.1 million in 2015 increased $22.6 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. Excluding the unfavorable impact of FX translation rates, SFG revenue grew
10% reflecting an increase in U.S. CMBS issuance primarily due to higher refinancing activity resulting from a large volume of maturing instruments in 2015 coupled with larger sized deals being rated. The growth also reflects higher U.S. RMBS
revenue resulting from an increase in deals rated and improved market coverage over the prior year. Furthermore, there was an increase in covered bond issuance in EMEA as well as benefits from the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type,
new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases. Partially offsetting these increases was an approximate $22 million unfavorable impact reflecting changes in FX translation rates compared to the prior year. Transaction revenue was 64% of total SFG
revenue in 2015 compared to 62% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $311.5 million increased $28.6 million compared to 2014. Non-U.S. revenue in 2015 of $137.6 million decreased $6.0 million from the prior year.

Global FIG revenue of $365.6 million in 2015 increased $10.9 million, or 3%, compared to 2014. Excluding the unfavorable impact of changes in FX translation rates, FIG
revenue grew 10% due to changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. Additionally, the growth reflects higher rated issuance volumes in the U.S. banking sector reflecting issuers taking advantage of favorable market
conditions for much of the year as well as revenue from the ICRA Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by an approximate $24 million unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates. Transaction revenue was 37% of total FIG
revenue in 2015 compared to 35% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $156.4 million increased $15.2 million compared to the prior year. Internationally, revenue was $209.2 million in 2015, or down $4.3 million compared to 2014.

Global PPIF revenue was $376.4 million in 2015 and increased $19.1 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of unfavorable changes in FX translation rates,
PPIF revenue grew 10% reflecting higher U.S. public finance refunding volumes due to continued low benchmark interest rates as well as the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases. These
increases were partially offset by lower U.S. infrastructure finance revenue compared to a strong prior year comparative period as well as an approximate $15 million unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates. Transaction revenue was
60% of total PPIF revenue in 2015 compared to 58% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue in 2015 was $244.7 million and increased $18.5 million compared to 2014. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue was flat compared to 2014.

Global MIS Other revenue was $30.4 million in 2015 and increased $12.4 million, or 69% compared to 2014. The increase
primarily reflects a full year of ICRA non-ratings revenue in 2015 compared to just one quarter of revenue in 2014.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2015 increased
$44.3 million compared to 2014 reflecting an increase in compensation and non-compensation costs of $20 million and $24 million, respectively. The increase in compensation reflects annual merit increases, headcount growth in the ratings LOBs as well
as in support areas such as IT, finance and human resources for which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. These increases were partially offset by decreases in incentive compensation costs reflecting lower
achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year. The increase in non-compensation expenses reflects higher costs to support various IT and operational enhancement projects and higher variable costs correlated with business
growth. Also, there were higher rent and occupancy costs for various global real estate expansion projects. The increase in both compensation and non-compensation expenses also reflects the acquisition of ICRA in the second half of 2014. Changes in
FX translation rates had an approximate $42 million favorable impact on MIS operating expenses compared to the prior year.

Adjusted Operating Income and operating
income in 2015 were $1,307.4 million and $1,241.4 million, respectively, and increased $30.2 million and $13.6 million, respectively, compared to 2014. Adjusted Operating Margin and operating margin were 53.9% and 51.1%, respectively, or 40 BPS and
110 BPS lower than the prior year, respectively. Adjusted Operating Income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.

The following is a discussion of external MA revenue and operating expenses:

Global MA revenue increased $81.8 million, or 8%, compared to 2014. Excluding the unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, MA revenue grew 12% reflecting growth in
RD&A and ERS which included revenue from the acquisitions of Lewtan and WebEquity, respectively. Recurring revenue comprised 74% and 73% of total MA revenue in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

In the U.S., revenue of $534.7 million in 2015 increased $61.2 million, and reflected growth in RD&A and ERS, which included revenue from Lewtan and WebEquity,
respectively.

International revenue of $615.6 million in 2015 was $20.6 million higher than in 2014 reflecting growth in all regions within RD&A and ERS
partially offset by an approximate $47 million unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates.

Global RD&A revenue of $626.4 million, which comprised
54% of total external MA revenue in both 2015 and 2014, increased $54.6 million, or 10%, over the prior year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact of FX translation rates, RD&A revenue grew 14% compared to the prior year. The growth over the
prior year was most notable in the U.S. and EMEA, primarily due to strong sales of credit research, licensing of ratings data and economic analysis and data. The acquisition of Lewtan in late 2014 also contributed to growth

over the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $351.9 million increased $45.1 million compared to 2014. Internationally, revenue increased $9.5 million compared to the prior year and included an
approximate $24 million unfavorable impact relating to unfavorable changes in FX translation rates.

Global ERS revenue of $374.0 million in 2015 increased $45.5
million, or 14%, over 2014. Excluding the unfavorable impact of changes in FX translation rates, ERS revenue grew 19%. This growth reflects increases across all product offerings with particular strength in the credit assessment and origination
business which included revenue recognized internationally from a large software implementation engagement for which VSOE for the annual software maintenance was established near the conclusion of the project. Additionally, the acquisition of
WebEquity contributed to the revenue growth. Revenue in ERS is subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of software implementation and license revenue in a relatively small number of
engagements. In the U.S., revenue of $131.2 million increased $21.1 million compared to 2014. Internationally, revenue of $242.8 million increased $24.4 million compared to the prior year and included an approximate $17 million unfavorable impact
relating to changes in FX translation rates.

Revenue from PS was $149.9 million and decreased $18.3 million, or 11%, from 2014. Excluding the unfavorable impact from
changes in FX translation rates, PS revenue declined 7% primarily due to the Company exiting certain Copal Amba product lines late in 2014 as well as attrition outpacing sales growth at Copal Amba as global banks adjusted their business activities.
In the U.S., revenue of $51.6 million decreased $5.0 million compared to 2014. Internationally, revenue decreased $13.3 million compared to the prior year and included an approximate $6 million unfavorable impact reflecting changes in FX translation
rates.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2015 increased $53.7 million compared to 2014. The expense growth reflects an approximate $39 million increase in
compensation costs primarily due to higher headcount to support business growth as well as higher headcount in support areas, for which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenue- split methodology. Headcount from the acquisitions of
WebEquity and Lewtan as well as annual merit increases also contributed to the compensation expense growth. Non-compensation expenses increased approximately $15 million due to higher costs for continued investment in IT infrastructure as well as
costs related to ERS product development and project delivery. Also, the expense growth reflected additional non-compensation costs related to the acquisitions of WebEquity and Lewtan. Changes in FX translation rates had an approximate
$29 million favorable impact on MA operating expenses in 2015 compared to the prior year.

Adjusted Operating Income was $279.5 million in 2015 and increased
$22.0 million compared to the same period in 2014. Operating income of $232.0 million in 2015 increased $20.7 million compared to the same period in 2014. Adjusted Operating Margin in 2015 was 24.0%, up 20 BPS from 2014. Operating margin was 19.9%
in 2015, up 40 BPS from the prior year. Adjusted operating income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.

MARKET RISK

Foreign exchange risk:

Moody’s maintains a presence in 35 countries outside the U.S. In 2016, approximately 36% and 27% of both the Company’s revenue and expenses, respectively were
denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally in the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 62% of Moody’s
assets were located outside the U.S. making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in FX rates. The effects of translating assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with non-U.S. functional currencies to the U.S. dollar are charged or credited
to AOCI in the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity (deficit).

The effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies
other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other non-operating income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially
mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency. If the British pound were to weaken 10% relative to the euro, there would be an approximate $3 million
unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts. Additionally, if the Singapore dollar were to devalue 10% compared to the euro, there would be an approximate $3 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts.
The change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by FX revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency. Additional
information on the Company’s forward contracts can be found in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10K.

Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries
against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. If there is any ineffectiveness in the net investment hedges, any change in the fair value of these hedges allocated to the ineffectiveness would be recognized immediately in other non-operating
(expense) income in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, all gains and losses on these derivatives designated as net investment hedges were recognized in OCI. If the British pound
were to appreciate 10% compared to the euro, there would be an approximate $3 million favorable impact to the foreign currency forward des-

ignated as a net investment hedge with a British pound/euro currency pairing. These adjustments would partially offset the currency translation adjustment component of AOCI. Additional
information on the Company’s forward contracts designated as net investment hedges can be found in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10K.

Also, the Company has designated

€

400 million of the 2015 Senior Notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate FX
exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries. If the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $42 million unfavorable adjustment to OCI. This adjustment would be offset by
favorable translation adjustments on the Company’s euro net investment in subsidiaries.

In conjunction with the designation of a portion of the 2015 Senior
Notes as a net investment hedge, the Company entered into a cross-currency swap (exchanging

€

100 million for U.S. dollars) to mitigate FX exposure on the remaining principal balance of the
2015 Senior Notes not designated as a net investment hedge. If the euro were to weaken 10% relative to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $13 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the cross-currency swap which would be
partially offset by favorable revaluation gains on the

€

100 million of the 2015 Senior Notes which were not designated as a net investment hedge.

Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short- term investments of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2016 consisted of $1.7 billion located outside the U.S.
Approximately 40% of the Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at December 31, 2016 were held in currencies other than USD. As such, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar,
particularly the euro and GBP, could reduce the reported amount of USD cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Credit and Interest rate risk:

The Company’s interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure
to the desired risk profile. Moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives.

The Company is exposed to
interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed rate of
interest on certain of its borrowings to a floating rate based on the 3-month LIBOR. These swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a
reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing, while net interest payments are recorded as interest expense/income in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. A hypothetical change of 100bps in the LIBOR-based
swap rate would result in an approximate $37 million change to the fair value of these interest rate swaps.

Additional information on these interest rate swaps is
disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in
high-quality investment-grade securities within and outside the U.S. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds,
money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit and issuers of high-grade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit.

Cash and short-term investments held in non-U.S. jurisdictions

The
Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2016 consisted of approximately $1.7 billion located outside of the U.S. Approximately 26% of the Company’s aggregate cash and
cash equivalents and short-term investments is denominated in euros and British pounds. Approximately 95% of the cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in the Company’s non-U.S. operations are held by entities whose undistributed
earnings are indefinitely reinvested in the Company’s foreign operations. Accordingly, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. A future distribution or change in assertion regarding
reinvestment by the foreign subsidiaries relating to these earnings could result in additional tax liability to the Company. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the potential additional tax liability due to complexities in the tax laws
and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made. The Company manages both its U.S. and international cash flow to maintain sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs.

Other Material Future Cash Requirements

The Company believes that it has
the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow in 2017. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Company’s profitability
and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources.

The Company remains committed to using its strong cash flow
to create value for shareholders by investing in growing areas of the business, reinvesting in ratings quality initiatives, making selective acquisitions, repurchasing stock and paying a dividend, all in manner consistent with maintaining sufficient
liquidity after giving effect to any additional indebtedness that may be incurred. In December 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share of Moody’s common stock, payable on March 10, 2017
to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2017. The continued payment of dividends at this

rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board. In December 2015, the Board authorized $1.0 billion of share repurchase authority, which had a remaining repurchase authority of
approximately $727 million at December 31, 2016. Full-year 2017 total share repurchases are expected to be approximately $500 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.

In January 2017, the Company reached an agreement with the DOJ and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia to resolve pending and potential
civil claims as more fully discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In accordance with this agreement, the Company will be required to pay a settlement amount of $863.8 million, most of which is
expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2017. Accordingly, in order to manage near-term liquidity needs in light of this settlement payment, the Company began borrowing under its CP Program in the first quarter of 2017 as more fully discussed in
“Indebtedness” below.

On February 6, 2008, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement to occupy six floors of an office tower located in
the Canary Wharf district of London, England. The Canary Wharf lease has an initial term of 17.5- years with a total of 15 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the Canary Wharf Lease over its initial 17.5-year term is approximately
£134 million, and the Company began making base rent payments in 2011. In addition to the base rent payments the Company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for its share of operating expenses and tax obligations. The total
remaining lease payments as of December 31, 2016 are approximately £86 million, of which approximately £10 million will be paid in the next twelve months. Payments under this lease agreement are included in the contractual
obligations table below.

On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square-feet of an
office building located at 7WTC at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which is serving as Moody’s headquarters. The 7WTC Lease has an initial term of 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. On March 28, 2007, the 7WTC
lease agreement was amended for the Company to lease an additional 78,568 square-feet at 7WTC. The total remaining lease payments for the 7WTC leases noted above are $389 million as of December 31, 2016, of which approximately $35 million will
be paid during the next twelve months. Payments under this lease agreement are included in the contractual obligations table below.

Indebtedness

At December 31, 2016, Moody’s had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1.0 billion of additional capacity available under the Company’s CP program which
is backstopped by the 2015 Facility as more fully discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. There were no borrowings outstanding under the CP Program or 2015 Facility at December 31, 2016. In the first quarter of 2017, the
Company began issuing CP to manage liquidity needs in light of the settlement payment to be made in the first quarter 2017 relating to a Settlement Charge as more fully discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of
this Form 10-K. As of February 22, 2017, the Company had $566.0 million of CP borrowings outstanding that have a weighted average maturity and interest rate of 63 days and 1.18%, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in
compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. The 2015 Facility, the 2007 Agreement, the 2010 Indenture, the 2012 Indenture, the 2013 Indenture, the 2014 Indenture and the 2015 Indenture contain cross default provisions.
These provisions state that default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. At
December 31, 2016, there were no such cross defaults.

The repayment schedule for the Company’s borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2016 is as
follows:

On February 16, 2017, the Company notified the holders of the Series 2007-1 Notes that it intends to prepay the notes on March 20, 2017 in accordance with provisions set forth in the 2007 Agreement. Accordingly, the
Company will make cash payments to the holders of the Series 2007-1 Notes totaling approximately $316 million in the first quarter of 2017 (payment consists of $300 million of principal, approximately $8 million in accrued interest, and
approximately $8 million in pre-payment penalties).

Management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of
cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2016, Moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as
special purpose or variable interest entities where Moody’s is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such,
Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.

The table above does not include the Company’s net long-term tax liabilities of $199.8 million relating to UTB and Legacy Tax Matters, since the expected cash outflow of such amounts by period cannot be reasonably

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

In addition
to its reported results, Moody’s has included in this MD&A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as “non-GAAP financial measures.” Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with
the Company’s reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the Company’s performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide
greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by the Company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of
other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other GAAP measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the Company. Below are brief descriptions of the
Company’s non-GAAP financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure:

Constant
Currency Measures:

The Company presents certain of its revenue on a constant currency basis because management deems this metric to be a useful measure
of assessing the operations of the Company in times of foreign exchange rate volatility. Constant currency measures exclude the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on operating results. The Company calculates the dollar impact of foreign
exchange as the difference between the translation of its current period non-USD functional currency results using prior comparative period weighted average foreign exchange translation rates and current year as reported results. Growth rates
on a constant currency basis are determined based on the difference between current period revenue translated using prior period comparative weighted average exchange rates and prior period as reported results divided by prior as reported
results. Below is a reconciliation of the Company’s as reported revenue changes to the revenue changes on a constant currency basis:

Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin:

The Company presents Adjusted Operating Income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of Moody’s.
Adjusted Operating Income excludes depreciation and amortization as well as goodwill impairment charges because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring productive assets including goodwill.
Companies also have different methods of depreciating and amortizing productive assets as well as different methods of valuing goodwill. Adjusted Operating Income also excludes restructuring charges and the Settlement Charge as the frequency and
magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies. Management believes that the exclusion of these items, detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the Company’s operating results from
period to period and across companies. The Company defines Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted Operating Income divided by revenue. Below is a reconciliation of the Company’s operating income and operating margin to Adjusted Operating Income

Free Cash Flow:

The Company
defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is a useful metric in assessing the Company’s cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to
fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Management deems capital expenditures essential to the Company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of Moody’s operational capabilities. Accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to
be a recurring use of Moody’s cash flow. Below is a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flows from operating activities to Free Cash Flow:

potential for increased competition and regulation in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions; exposure to litigation related to our rating opinions, as well as any other litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquires
to which the Company may be subject from time to time; provisions in the Financial Reform Act legislation modifying the pleading standards, and EU regulations modifying the liability standards, applicable to credit rating agencies in a manner
adverse to credit rating agencies; provisions of EU regulations imposing additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services; the possible loss of key employees; failures or malfunctions of our operations and
infrastructure; any vulnerabilities to cyber threats or other cybersecurity concerns; the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Company’s global tax planning initiatives; exposure to potential criminal sanctions or civil
remedies if the Company fails to comply with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including sanctions laws, anti-corruption laws, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to
government officials; the impact of mergers, acquisitions or other business combinations and the ability of the Company to successfully integrate acquired businesses; currency and foreign exchange volatility; the level of future cash flows; the
levels of capital investments; and a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions. These factors, risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moody’s actual

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Moody’s Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the SEC in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Moody’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Moody’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company has undertaken an assessment of the design and operational effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2016 based on criteria established in the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based on the assessment performed, management has concluded that Moody’s maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Moody’s Corporation:

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Moody’s Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control
– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Moody’s Corporation’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Moody’s Corporation as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion,
Moody’s Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

MOODY’S CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(tabular dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share data)

NOTE 1

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings,
(ii) credit, capital markets and economic research, data and analytical tools, (iii) software solutions and related risk management services, (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, financial services training and certification
services and (v) research and analytical services. Moody’s has two reportable segments: MIS and MA.

MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings
on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to
investors. Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations which consist primarily of the distribution of research and financial instrument pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA’s
non-ratings operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.

The MA segment
develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS
as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit-related events. The RD&A business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools such as
quantitative credit risk scores. Within its ERS business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. The PS business provides research and analytical services along with financial training and certification programs.

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes” on a
prospective basis, and accordingly, prior year comparative periods have not been adjusted. This ASU requires the classification of all deferred income tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet.

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs” on a retrospective basis. This ASU
requires a company to present debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a reduction of debt rather than as an asset. The impact to the Company’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 relating to the adoption of this ASU is set
forth in the table below:

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current presentation.

NOTE 2

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include those of Moody’s Corporation and its majority- and wholly-owned subsidiaries. The effects of all intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies for which the Company has significant influence over operating and financial policies but not a controlling interest are accounted for on an equity basis whereby the Company records its
proportional share of the investment’s net income or loss as part of other non-operating income (expense), net and any dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment. The Company applies the guidelines set forth in Topic 810 of
the ASC in assessing its interests in variable interest entities to decide whether to consolidate that entity. The Company has reviewed the potential variable interest entities and determined that there are no consolidation requirements under Topic
810 of the ASC. The Company consolidates its ICRA subsidiaries on a three month lag.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents principally consist of investments in money market mutual funds and money market deposit accounts as well as high-grade commercial paper and certificates
of deposit with maturities of three months or less when purchased.

MOODY’S

2016 10K



Short-term Investments

Short-term
investments are securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase that are available for operations in the next 12 months. The Company’s short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and their cost
approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. Interest and dividends on these investments are recorded into income when earned.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and are
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not extend the economic useful life of the related assets are charged to expense as incurred.

Research and Development Costs

All research and development costs are expensed
as incurred. These costs primarily reflect the development of credit processing software and quantitative credit risk assessment products sold by the MA segment.

Research and development costs were $40.1 million, $29.1 million, and $37.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are
included in operating expenses within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. These costs generally consist of professional services provided by third parties and compensation costs of employees.

Costs for internally developed computer software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established.
These costs primarily relate to the development or enhancement of products in the ERS business and generally consist of professional services provided by third parties and compensation costs of employees that develop the software. Judgment is
required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and the Company believes that technological feasibility for its software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding
and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to customers. Accordingly, costs for internally developed computer software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed that were eligible for capitalization under
Topic 985 of the ASC were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

The Company capitalizes costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use. These assets, included in property and equipment in the consolidated balance
sheets, relate to the Company’s accounting, product delivery and other systems. Such costs generally consist of direct costs for third-party license fees, professional services provided by third parties and employee compensation, in each case
incurred either during the application development stage or in connection with upgrades and enhancements that increase functionality. Such costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Costs incurred during the
preliminary project stage of development as well as maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other Acquired
Intangible Assets

Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating
segment, annually as of July 31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with ASC Topic 350.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of
goodwill using a three-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a
determination is made that, based on the qualitative factors, an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more likely
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the
carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must perform a third
step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value
of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. The Company evaluates its reporting units for
impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions or realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment. For the reporting units where the Company is
consistently able to conclude that an impairment does not exist using only a qualitative approach, the Company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three
years. Goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units, and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.

For purposes of assessing the recoverability of goodwill, the Company has six primary reporting units at December 31, 2016: two within the Company’s ratings
business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody’s other ratings operations) and four


MOODY’S

reporting units within MA: RD&A, ERS, FSTC and MAKS. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings
process, in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The ERS reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software that is sold on a
license or subscription basis as well as related advisory services for implementation and maintenance. The FSTC reporting unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development
training and certification services. The MAKS reporting unit consists of research and analytical services.

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for
recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Rent Expense

The Company records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. In cases where there is a free rent period or future fixed rent escalations the
Company will record a deferred rent liability. Additionally, the receipt of any lease incentives will be recorded as a deferred rent liability which will be amortized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records compensation expense for all
share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under stock option and restricted stock plans. The Company has also established a pool of
additional paid-in capital related to the net Excess Tax Benefits relating to employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb any recognized tax shortfalls.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Based on the Company’s risk
management policy, from time to time the Company may use derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes. All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The changes in the value of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are recorded with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying
value of the item being hedged. Changes in the derivative’s fair value that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded to other comprehensive income or loss, to the extent the hedge is effective, and such amounts are reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income or loss to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. Changes in the derivative’s fair value that qualify as net investment hedges are recorded to other comprehensive
income or loss, to the extent the hedge is effective. Any changes in the fair value of derivatives that the Company does not designate as hedging instruments under Topic 815 of the ASC are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the
period in which they occur.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.

Pursuant to ASC Topic 605, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price
which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

The Company’s products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under ASC Topic 605. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an
arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right
relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. In instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined
with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.

The Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction
meets the VSOE criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or, if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority to establish such a price. In
instances where the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a reasonably narrow price
range, or only having a limited sales history, the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to
similarly situated customers. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a
significant level of differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy
established by ASC Topic 605, when the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a
stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best

MOODY’S

2016 10K



estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a
primary product or service relative to a related product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its
determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.

In the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is
recognized when the rating is issued. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed
securities, structured credit, international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the
expected lives of the rated securities, which was approximately 25 years on a weighted average basis at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $133 million,
$121 million, and $107 million, respectively.

Multiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related
monitoring service. In instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total
arrangement fees. The Company generally uses ESP in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or
TPE for initial ratings.

MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly
based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, accounts receivable included approximately $25 million, $24 million, and $22 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the
estimated revenue and the actual billings. Furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period. At December 31, 2016,
2015, and 2014, accounts receivable included approximately $159.1 million, $146.4 million, and $127.8 million, respectively, relating to accrued monitoring service revenue.

In the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from
subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from
sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the
product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are
performed. A large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.

Products and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element arrangement
includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the
aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.

If the arrangement
contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to determine VSOE for
all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an undelivered element, the
Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements. In cases where software implementation services are considered
essential and VSOE of fair value exists for post-contract customer support (“PCS”), once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as
implementation services are performed, while PCS is recognized over the coverage period. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for PCS, once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero profit
margin basis until essential services are complete, at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining PCS coverage period. If VSOE does not exist for PCS at the beginning of an arrangement but is
established during implementation, revenue not recognized due to the absence of VSOE will be recognized on a cumulative basis.

Accounts Receivable Allowances

Moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions.
Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual billing
adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are recorded against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of
customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody’s adjusts its allowance as
considered appropriate in the circumstances.

Contingencies

Moody’s is
involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing
tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending
legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental
investigations and inquires not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and
periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within
the range. In other instances, where a loss is reasonably possible, management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, but discloses the contingency if significant. As
additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and
inquiries, enforcement and similar matters, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the
eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on
its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such
matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties
regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.

The Company’s wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary insures the Company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker’s compensation, employment practices litigation and employee medical claims and terrorism, for which the claims are not material to the
Company. In addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the Company for defense costs related to professional liability claims. For matters insured by the Company’s insurance subsidiary, Moody’s records
liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion. The Company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management’s best estimate of
claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates. Defense costs for matters not self-insured by the Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided.

For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is
more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full
knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement
with a taxing authority.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses include
costs associated with the development and production of the Company’s products and services and their delivery to customers. These expenses principally include employee compensation and benefits and travel costs that are incurred in connection
with these activities. Operating expenses are charged to income as incurred, except for certain costs related to software implementation services which are deferred until related revenue is recognized. Additionally, certain costs incurred to develop
internal use software are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses include such items as compensation and benefits for corporate officers and staff and compensation and other expenses related to sales of products. They
also include items such as office rent, business insurance, professional fees and gains and losses from

MOODY’S

2016 10K



sales and disposals of assets. SG&A expenses are charged to income as incurred, except for certain expenses incurred to develop internal use software are capitalized and depreciated over
their estimated useful life.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

The
Company records its redeemable noncontrolling interest at fair value on the date of the related business combination transaction. The redeemable noncontrolling interest represents noncontrolling shareholders’ interest in entities which are
controlled but not wholly-owned by Moody’s and for which Moody’s obligation to redeem the minority shareholders’ interest is governed by a put/call relationship. Subsequent to the initial measurement, the redeemable noncontrolling
interest is recorded at the greater of its redemption value or its carrying value at the end of each reporting period. If the redeemable noncontrolling interest is carried at its redemption value, the difference between the redemption value and the
carrying value would be adjusted through capital surplus at the end of each reporting period. The Company also performs a quarterly assessment to determine if the aforementioned redemption value exceeds the fair value of the redeemable
noncontrolling interest. If the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest were to exceed its fair value, the excess would reduce the net income attributable to Moody’s shareholders. The Company settled its redeemable
noncontrolling interest in the fourth quarter of 2014 by exercising its call option to acquire the remaining share of Copal Amba that it did not previously own.

Foreign Currency Translation

For all operations outside the U.S. where the
Company has designated the local currency as the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of year exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the year. For
these foreign operations, currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ deficit.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income represents the change in net assets of a business enterprise during a period due to transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources including foreign currency translation impacts, net actuarial losses and net prior service costs related to pension and other retirement plans, gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges or cash flow
hedges and unrealized gains and losses on securities designated as ‘available-for-sale’ under Topic 320 of the ASC. Comprehensive income items, including cumulative translation adjustments of entities that are less-than-wholly-owned
subsidiaries, will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests and thereby, adjusting accumulated other comprehensive income proportionately in accordance with the percentage of ownership interest of the NCI shareholder.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that
are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. In 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”
whereby all deferred income tax assets and liabilities as well as any related valuation allowances are classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.

The Company
classifies interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties are recognized in other non-operating expenses. For uncertain tax positions (“UTPs”), the
Company first determines whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will
examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be
realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

For certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, the Company has deemed the undistributed earnings relating to
these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations. Accordingly, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. It is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred
taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments
include cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, all of which are short-term in nature and, accordingly, approximate fair value. Additionally, the Company invests in certain short-term investments consisting primarily of certificates
of deposit that are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.

The Company also has certain investments in closed-ended and
open-ended mutual funds in India which are designated as ‘available for sale’ under Topic 320 of the ASC. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income and are reclassified out of
accumulated other comprehensive income to the statement of operations when the investment matures or is sold using a specific identification method.


MOODY’S

Also, the Company uses derivative instruments, as further described in Note 5, to manage certain financial exposures that
occur in the normal course of business. These derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The Company also
was subject to contingent consideration obligations related to certain of its acquisitions as more fully discussed in Note 10. These obligations were carried at their estimated fair value within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Fair value is defined by the ASC as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The determination of this fair value is based on the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company could commence transactions and considers assumptions that market participants would
use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. Also, determination of fair value assumes that market participants will consider the highest and best use of the asset.

The ASC establishes a fair value hierarchy whereby the inputs contained in valuation techniques used to measure fair value are categorized into three broad levels as
follows:

Level 1

: quoted market prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the date of the fair value measurement;

Level 2

: inputs other than quoted market prices described in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted
prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities;

Level 3

: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value measurement of the assets or liabilities.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade
receivables and derivatives.

The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, money market
deposit accounts, certificates of deposits and high-grade commercial paper. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents
and short-term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single entity. No customer accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 or 2015.

Earnings (Loss) per Share of Common Stock

Basic shares outstanding is
calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, assuming that such shares were
outstanding and dilutive during the reporting period.

Pension and Other Retirement Benefits

Moody’s maintains various noncontributory DBPPs as well as other contributory and noncontributory retirement plans. The expense and assets/liabilities that the
Company reports for its pension and other retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions represent the Company’s best estimates and may vary by plan. The
differences between the assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and actual experience is spread over a five-year period to the market-related value of plan assets which is used in determining the expected return on
assets component of annual pension expense. All other actuarial gains and losses are generally deferred and amortized over the estimated average future working life of active plan participants.

The Company recognizes as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheet the funded status of its defined benefit retirement plans, measured on a plan-by-plan
basis. Changes in the funded status due to actuarial gains/losses are recorded as part of other comprehensive income during the period the changes occur.

Use of
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates
are used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, income taxes, contingencies, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, goodwill, pension and other retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, and
depreciable lives for property and equipment and computer software.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”. This ASU outlines a comprehensive new revenue
recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Deferral of the Effective Date” which defers the effective date of the ASU for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, with early adoption permitted up to the original effective date of December 15, 2016. In addition, during 2016, the FASB issued additional updates clarifying the implementation guidance for the new revenue recognition standard.

The Company intends to adopt the new revenue guidance as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method and is currently evaluating the impact
that adoption of these updates will have on its consolidated financial statements. Currently, the Company believes this ASU will have an impact on, but is not limited to: i) the accounting for certain software subscription revenue in MA whereby
the license rights within the arrangement would be recognized at the inception of the contract based on estimated stand-alone selling price with the remainder recognized over the subscription period; ii) the accounting for certain ERS revenue
arrangements where VSOE is not currently available under ASC 605 should result in the acceleration of revenue recognition and iii) the capitalization of certain contract implementation costs for its ERS business which will be expensed as incurred
under the new standard.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10), Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. The amendments in this ASU update various aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures relating to financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company’s financial statements. The Company believes that the most pertinent impact to its financial statements upon the adoption of this ASU will
relate to the discontinuance of the available-for-sale classification for investments in equity securities (unrealized gains and losses were recorded through OCI). Accordingly, subsequent to adoption of this ASU, changes in the fair value of equity
securities held by the Company will be recorded through earnings.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” requiring
lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows will depend on classification as either a finance or operating
lease. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. This standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach whereby leases will be presented in accordance with the new
standard as of the earliest period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company’s financial statements. The Company believes that the most notable impact to its financial statements upon the adoption of
this ASU will be the recognition of a material right-of-use asset and lease liability for its real estate leases.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-07, “Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting”. This ASU amends the accounting for an investment not previously accounted for under the
equity method that subsequently qualifies for the equity method of accounting. It requires a company to add the cost of the additional interest acquired to its current basis and the commencement of the equity method of accounting when the criteria
are met. In addition, the unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive related to an available for sale equity security should be recognized through earnings if the investment subsequently qualifies for the equity method of
accounting. The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU will only impact the Company if an investment not previously accounted for under
the equity method qualifies for accounting under the equity method.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation—Stock Compensation
(Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”. This ASU changes various aspects related to the accounting for share-based payments including: i) accounting for Excess Tax Benefits and shortfalls; ii) the accounting for
forfeitures; iii) restrictions on the value of shares retained by an entity to fund the employee’s portion of payroll taxes; and iv) classification of Excess Tax Benefits in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted if all amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company expects that the most significant effect of this ASU will be the impact on its reported Net Income and Diluted EPS
as Excess Tax Benefits and shortfalls will be recorded to the provision for income taxes under this ASU as compared to an adjustment to capital surplus under current GAAP. The Company will adopt this ASU in the first quarter of 2017. The Company
expects that the adoption of this ASU will result in a benefit to the 2017 ETR of approximately 200 BPS, or a $0.15 benefit per diluted share. This estimated impact is subject to change based on the trading price of the Company’s stock on the
date that stock-based compensation awards are exercised/delivered and on the volume of employee exercises/delivery of restricted stock. Due to the sensitivity that Moody’s stock price has on the value of the Excess Tax Benefit/Shortfall, the
impact in a given year may not be indicative of the impact in future years.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial
Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”. The amendments in this ASU require the use of an “expected credit loss” impairment model for most financial assets reported at
amortized cost which will require entities to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the instrument. This

may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, an allowance for credit losses will be recognized as a contra
account to the amortized cost carrying value of the asset rather than a direct reduction to the carrying value, with changes in the allowance impacting earnings. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted in annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
beginning of the first effective reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements. Currently, the Company believes that the most notable impact of this ASU will relate to its processes around
the assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”. This ASU adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows with the intent to alleviate
diversity in practice for classifying various types of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company will apply this clarification
guidance in its statements of cash flows upon adoption.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers
of Assets Other Than Inventory”. This ASU requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, instead of deferring recognition until the asset has
been sold to a third party as required under current GAAP. The ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, using a modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect recognized through
retained earnings at the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company intends to early adopt this ASU in the first quarter of 2017 and does not anticipate it will have a material impact on its financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805), Clarifying the Definition of a Business”. This ASU clarifies the
definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This ASU is effective for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the Company will apply the guidance in this ASU when evaluating whether acquired assets and activities
constitute a business.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for
Goodwill Impairment”. This ASU removes the step of the goodwill impairment assessment in which a company must measure a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of
that goodwill. Under the ASU, goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. This ASU is effective for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company intends to early adopt this ASU for impairment assessments performed in 2017.

The calculation of diluted EPS requires certain assumptions regarding the use of both cash proceeds and assumed proceeds that would be
received upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. These assumed proceeds include Excess Tax Benefits and any unrecognized compensation on the awards.

The decrease in the diluted shares outstanding primarily reflects treasury share repurchases under the Company’s Board authorized share repurchase program.

NOTE 5

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company is exposed to global market risks, including risks from
changes in FX rates and changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the Company uses derivatives in certain instances to manage the aforementioned financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue
derivatives for speculative purposes.

Derivatives and non-derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:

Interest Rate Swaps

The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to
convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its long-term debt to a floating interest rate based on the 3-month LIBOR. The purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the risk associated with changes in the fair value of the long-term debt, thus the
Company has designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The fair value of the swaps is adjusted quarterly with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the debt. The changes in the fair value of the swaps and the underlying hedged item
generally offset and the net cash settlements on the swaps are recorded each period within interest expense, net in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.

The following table summarizes the Company’s interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:

Cross-currency swaps

In conjunction
with the issuance of the 2015 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a cross-currency swap to exchange

€

100 million for U.S. dollars on the date of the settlement of the notes. The purpose
of this cross-currency swap is to mitigate FX risk on the remaining principal balance on the 2015 Senior Notes that was not designated as a net investment hedge as more fully discussed below. Under the terms of the swap, the Company will pay the
counterparty interest on the $110.5 million received at 3.945% per annum and the counterparty will pay the Company interest on the

€

100 million paid at 1.75% per annum. These
interest payments will be settled in March of each year, beginning in 2016, until either the maturity of the cross-currency swap in 2027 or upon early termination at the discretion of the Company. The principal payments on this cross currency swap
will be settled in 2027, concurrent with the repayment of the 2015 Senior Notes at maturity or upon early termination at the discretion of the Company. In March 2016, the Company designated these cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges.
Accordingly, changes in fair value subsequent to the date the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges will initially be recognized in OCI. Gains and losses on the swaps initially recognized in OCI will be reclassified to the statement of
operations in the period in which changes in the underlying hedged item affects net income. Ineffectiveness, if any, will be recognized in other non-operating (expense) income, net in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.

Net Investment Hedges

The Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts that are designated as net investment hedges and additionally has designated

€

400 million of the 2015 Senior Notes as a net investment hedge. These hedges are intended to mitigate
FX exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. These net investment hedges are designated as accounting hedges under the applicable sections of Topic 815 of the ASC.

Hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the overall changes in the fair value of the hedge. For hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, any change in the
fair value are recorded in AOCI in the foreign currency translation account. Any change in the fair value of these hedges that is the result of ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in other non-operating (expense) income, net in the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations.

The following table summarizes the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding forward contracts that are
designated as net investment hedges:

ICRA Limited

On June 26, 2014, a subsidiary of the Company acquired
2,154,722 additional shares of ICRA Limited, a publicly traded company in India. ICRA is a leading provider of credit ratings and research in India and extends MIS’s reach in the growing domestic debt market in India as well as other emerging
markets in the region. The acquisition of the additional shares increased Moody’s ownership stake in ICRA from 28.5% to just over 50%, resulting in a controlling interest in ICRA. Moody’s consolidates ICRA’s financial statements on a
three-month lag.

Prior to the acquisition of the additional shares, Moody’s accounted for its investment in ICRA on an equity basis whereby the Company recorded
its proportional share of the investment’s net income or loss as part of other non-operating income (expense), net. The acquisition of the additional shares has resulted in the Company consolidating ICRA into its financial statements. As a
result of this consolidation and in accordance with ASC 805, the carrying value of the Company’s equity investment in ICRA was remeasured to fair value as of the acquisition date resulting in a pre-tax gain of $102.8 million ($78.5 million
after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014. The fair value of the Company’s equity investment was based on ICRA’s quoted market price on the date of acquisition.

Current assets include acquired cash of approximately $5 million. Additionally, current assets includes gross accounts
receivable of approximately $14 million, of which an immaterial amount is not expected to be collectible. Goodwill, which has been assigned to the MIS segment, is not deductible for tax.

The fair value of the non-controlling interest was determined based on the quoted market price per share of ICRA on the date that the Company acquired the controlling
stake.

ICRA operates at its own reporting unit for purposes of the Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, ICRA divested its interest in ICTEAS, which is part of the MIS Other LOB, and resulted in an immaterial gain. The impact of ICTEAS’s
operations, financial position and cash flows were not material to Moody’s.

The 2016 goodwill derecognized for the MIS segment in the table above relates to the divestiture of ICTEAS in the fourth quarter of 2016
as more fully discussed in Note 7. The 2016 additions/adjustments for the MA segment in the table above primarily relate to the acquisition of GGY. The 2015 additions/adjustments for the MIS segment in the table above relate to the acquisition of
Equilibrium. The 2015 additions/adjustments for the MA segment primarily reflect an adjustment to an indemnification asset recognized as part of the Copal acquisition, goodwill acquired from the acquisition of a business from BlackBox Logic and
adjustments to deferred revenue balances and deferred tax assets recognized as part of the Lewtan acquisition.

The accumulated impairment charge in the table above
reflects an impairment charge recognized in 2012 relating to the FSTC reporting unit within MA. This impairment charge reflected a contraction in spending for training and certification services for many individuals and global financial institutions
in 2012 due to macroeconomic uncertainties at the time. The fair value of the FSTC reporting unit utilized in this impairment assessment was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction
multiples.

RESTRUCTURING

In September 2016, the Company approved a restructuring plan relating to cost management initiatives
in the MIS segment as well as in certain corporate overhead functions. This restructuring plan consists solely of headcount reductions, which when combined with an

The following are descriptions of the methodologies utilized by the Company to estimate the fair value of its derivative contracts, fixed
maturity plans, money market mutual funds, and contingent consideration obligations:

Derivatives:

In determining the fair value of the derivative contracts in the table above, the Company utilizes industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models
project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using spot rates, forward points, currency volatilities, interest rates as well as the risk of non-performance of the Company and the counterparties with whom it has
derivative contracts. The Company established strict counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions that adhere to these guidelines. Accordingly, the risk of counterparty default is deemed to be minimal.

Fixed maturity and open ended mutual funds:

The fixed maturity mutual
funds and open ended mutual funds primarily represent exchange traded funds in India and are classified as securities available-for-sale. Accordingly, any unrealized gains and losses are recognized through OCI until the instruments mature or are
sold.

Money market mutual funds:

The money market mutual funds represent
publicly traded funds with a stable $1 net asset value.

Contingent Consideration:

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company settled a contingent consideration obligation of 2.5 million Canadian dollars related to the acquisition of CSI that
was based on certain non-financial metrics set forth in the acquisition agreement. Prior to the settlement of this obligation, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow methodology to value this obligation. These obligations were measured using
Level 3 inputs as defined in the ASC.

For certain of the contingent consideration obligations relating to the acquisition of Copal, a portion of the contingent cash
payments were based on revenue and EBITDA growth for certain of the Copal entities. This growth was calculated by comparing revenue and EBITDA in the year immediately prior to the exercise of the put/call option to acquire the remaining 33%
ownership interest of Copal Partners Limited, to revenue and EBITDA in Copal’s fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. Payments of $12.2 million under this arrangement were made in the fourth quarter of 2014 pursuant to the Company exercising
its call option to acquire the remaining shares of Copal Amba. The Company had utilized discounted cash flow methodologies to value these obligations prior to their settlement in 2014. The expected future cash flows for these obligations were
discounted using a risk-free interest rate plus a credit spread based on the option adjusted spread of the Company’s publicly traded debt as of the valuation date plus sovereign and size risk premiums. The most significant unobservable input
involved in the measurement of these obligations were the projected future financial results of the applicable Copal Amba entities.

For the contingent consideration
obligations relating to the acquisition of Amba, the payment was based on the acquired entity achieving a revenue target for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 which was met resulting in a $4.3 million payment in 2014.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest:

In
connection with the acquisition of Copal, the Company and the non-controlling shareholders entered into a put/call option agreement whereby the Company had the option to purchase from the non-controlling shareholders and the non-controlling
shareholders had the option to sell to the Company the remaining 33% ownership interest of Copal Partners Limited based on a strike price to be calculated on pre-determined formulas using a combination of revenue and EBITDA multiples when exercised.
The value of the estimated put/call option strike price on the date of acquisition was based on a Monte Carlo simulation model. This model contemplated multiple scenarios which simulated certain of Copal’s revenue, EBITDA margins and equity
values to estimate the present value of the expected strike price of the option. In connection with the acquisition of Amba in December 2013, which was combined with Copal to form the Copal Amba operating segment and reporting unit, the
aforementioned revenue and EBITDA multiples set forth in the put/call option agreement were modified to include the results of Amba. The option was subject to a minimum exercise price of $46 million. There was no limit as to the maximum amount of
the strike price on the put/call option.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company exercised its call option to acquire the remaining interest of Copal Amba.

NOTE 13

PENSION AND OTHER RETIREMENT BENEFITS

U.S. Plans

Moody’s maintains funded and unfunded noncontributory Defined Benefit Pension Plans. The U.S. plans provide defined benefits using a cash balance formula based on
years of service and career average salary or final average pay for selected executives. The Company also provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired U.S. employees. The retirement healthcare plans are contributory; the life
insurance plans are noncontributory. Moody’s funded and unfunded U.S. pension plans, the U.S. retirement healthcare plans and the U.S. retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the “Retirement Plans”. The
U.S. retirement healthcare plans and the U.S. retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the “Other Retirement Plans”. Effective at the Distribution Date, Moody’s assumed responsibility for the pension and
other retirement benefits relating to its active employees. New D&B has assumed responsibility for the Company’s retirees and vested terminated employees as of the Distribution Date.

Through 2007, substantially all U.S. employees were eligible to participate in the Company’s DBPPs. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company no longer offers
DBPPs to U.S. employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 and new hires in the U.S. instead will receive a retirement contribution in similar benefit value under the Company’s Profit Participation Plan. Current participants of
the Company’s Retirement Plans and Other Retirement Plans continue to accrue benefits based on existing plan benefit formulas.

The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the Company’s best estimate of the long-term return on plan
assets and is determined by using a building block approach, which generally weighs the underlying long-term expected rate of return for each major asset class based on their respective allocation target within the plan portfolio, net of plan paid
expenses. As the assumption reflects a long-term time horizon, the plan performance in any one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence the Company’s evaluation. For 2016, the expected rate of return used in calculating the
net periodic benefit costs was 6.10%. For 2017, the Company’s expected rate of return assumption was 5.40% to reflect the Company’s current view of long-term capital market outlook. In addition, the Company has updated its mortality
assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale MP-2016 to accompany the RP-2014 mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the Society of Actuaries. Additionally, the assumed
healthcare cost trend rate assumption is not material to the valuation of the other retirement plans.

Plan Assets

Moody’s investment objective for the assets in the funded pension plan is to earn total returns that will minimize future contribution requirements over the
long-term within a prudent level of risk. The Company works with its independent investment consultants to determine asset allocation targets for its pension plan investment portfolio based on its assessment of business and financial conditions,
demographic and actuarial data, funding characteristics, and related risk factors. Other relevant factors, including historical and forward looking views of inflation and capital market returns, are also considered. Risk management practices include
monitoring plan asset performance, diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. The Company’s Asset Management Committee is responsible for overseeing the investment
activities of the plan, which includes selecting acceptable asset classes, defining allowable ranges of holdings by asset class and by individual investment managers, defining acceptable securities within each asset class, and establishing
investment performance expectations. Ongoing monitoring of the plan includes reviews of investment performance and managers on a regular basis, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.

In 2014, the Company implemented a revised investment policy, which uses risk-controlled investment strategies by increasing the plan’s asset allocation to fixed
income securities and specifying ranges of acceptable target allocation by asset class based on different levels of the plan’s accounting funded status. In addition, the investment policy also requires the investment-grade fixed income asset be
rebalanced between shorter and longer duration bonds as the interest rate environment changes. This revised investment policy is designed to help protect the plan’s funded status and to limit volatility of the Company’s contributions.
Based on the revised policy, the Company’s current target asset allocation is approximately 53% (range of 48% to 58%) in equity securities, 40% (range of 35% to 45%) in fixed income securities and 7% (range of 4% to 10%) in other investments
and the plan will use a combination of active and passive investment strategies and different investment styles for its investment portfolios within each asset class. The plan’s equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks
of small, medium and large capitalization. The plan’s fixed income investments are diversified principally across U.S. and non-U.S. government and corporate bonds which are expected to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to
better align assets with obligations. The plan also invests in other fixed income investments such debts rated below investment grade, emerging market debt, and convertible securities. The plan’s other investment, which is made through a
private real estate debt fund, is expected to provide additional diversification benefits and absolute return enhancement to the plan assets.

Cash and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investment in money market mutual funds. In determining fair value,
Level 1 investments are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Investments in common/collective trust funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) per unit in each fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying
investments owned by each trust, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Common/collective trust funds are categorized in Level 2 to the extent that they are considered to have a readily determinable fair value.
Investments for which fair value is estimated by using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.

Except for the Company’s U.S. funded pension plan, all of Moody’s Retirement Plans are unfunded and therefore have no plan assets.

Cash Flows

The Company contributed $22.4 million and $21.6 million to its U.S.
funded pension plan during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company made payments of $4.0 million and $2.7 million related to its U.S. unfunded pension plan obligations during the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The Company made payments of $0.5 million and $0.4 million to its Other Retirement Plans during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company presently anticipates making contributions of $10.4
million to its funded pension plan, and anticipates making payments of $5.1 million related to its unfunded U.S. pension plans and $1.0 million related to its Other Retirement Plans during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Defined Contribution Plans

Moody’s has a
Profit Participation Plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. The Profit Participation Plan provides for an employee salary deferral and the Company matches employee contributions, equal to 50% of employee contribution up to a maximum of 3%
of the employee’s pay. Moody’s also makes additional contributions to the Profit Participation Plan based on year-to-year growth in the Company’s EPS. Effective January 1, 2008, all new hires are automatically enrolled in the
Profit Participation Plan when they meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. As the Company’s U.S. DBPPs are closed to new entrants effective January 1, 2008, all eligible new hires will instead receive a retirement
contribution into the Profit Participation Plan in value similar to the pension benefits. Additionally, effective January 1, 2008, the Company implemented a deferred compensation plan in the U.S., which is unfunded and provides for employee
deferral of compensation and Company matching contributions related to compensation in excess of the IRS limitations on benefits and contributions under qualified retirement plans. Total expenses associated with U.S. defined contribution plans were
$28.3 million, $21.1 million and $26.8 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2008, Moody’s has designated the Moody’s
Stock Fund, an investment option under the Profit Participation Plan, as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and, as a result, participants in the Moody’s Stock Fund may receive dividends in cash or may reinvest such dividends into the
Moody’s Stock Fund. Moody’s paid approximately $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.6 million in dividends during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the Company’s common shares held by the
Moody’s Stock Fund. The Company records the dividends as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit). The Moody’s Stock Fund held approximately 471,000 and 488,000 shares of
Moody’s common stock at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

International Plans

Certain of the Company’s international operations provide pension benefits to their employees. The non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are immaterial. For defined
contribution plans, company contributions are primarily determined as a percentage of employees’ eligible compensation. Moody’s also makes contributions to non-U.S. employees under a profit sharing plan which is based on year-to-year
growth in the Company’s diluted EPS. Expenses related to these defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $24.5 million, $26.7 million and $30.6 million, respectively.

NOTE 14

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

Under the 1998 Plan, 33.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock
have been reserved for issuance. The 2001 Plan, which is shareholder approved, permits the granting of up to 50.6 million shares, of which not more than 14.0 million shares are available for grants of awards other than stock options. The
Stock Plans also provide for the granting of restricted stock. The Stock Plans provide that options are exercisable not later than ten years from the grant date. The vesting period for awards under the Stock Plans is generally determined by the
Board at the date of the grant and has been four years except for employees who are at or near retirement eligibility, as defined, for which vesting is between one and four years. Additionally, the vesting period is three years for certain
performance-based restricted stock that contain a condition whereby the number of shares that ultimately vest are based on the achievement of certain non-market based performance metrics of the Company. Options may not be granted at less than the
fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant.

The Company maintains the Directors’ Plan for its Board, which permits the granting
of awards in the form of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock or performance shares. The Directors’ Plan provides that options are exercisable not later than ten years from the grant date. The vesting period is determined by the Board
at the date of the grant and is generally one year for both options and restricted stock. Under the Directors’ Plan, 1.7 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. Any director of the Company who is not an employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the date that an award is granted is eligible to participate in the Directors’ Plan.

Presented below is a summary of
the stock-based compensation expense and associated tax benefit in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations:

The fair value of each employee stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that
uses the assumptions noted below. The expected dividend yield is derived from the annual dividend rate on the date of grant. The expected stock volatility is based on an assessment of historical weekly stock prices of the Company as well as implied
volatility from Moody’s traded options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. government zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to the expected holding period. The expected holding period was determined by examining historical and
projected post-vesting exercise behavior activity.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between
Moody’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the year ended December 31, 2016 and the exercise prices, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders
exercised their options as of December 31, 2016. This amount varies based on the fair value of Moody’s stock. As of December 31, 2016 there was $7.5 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to options. The expense is

The Company has a policy of issuing treasury stock to satisfy shares issued under stock-based compensation plans.

In addition, the Company also sponsors the ESPP. Under the ESPP, 6.0 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. The ESPP allows eligible employees to
purchase common stock of the Company on a monthly basis at a discount to the average of the high and the low trading prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day of each month. This discount was 5% in 2016, 2015 and 2014 resulting
in the ESPP qualifying for non-compensatory status under Topic 718 of the ASC. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for the ESPP in 2016, 2015, and 2014. The employee purchases are funded through after-tax payroll deductions, which
plan participants can elect from one percent to ten percent of compensation, subject to the annual federal limit.

On November 20, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes”, which required that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15

th

, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted this guidance as of January 1

st

, 2016 on a prospective basis. Prior periods were
not retrospectively adjusted.

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $2,902.5 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that it intends to
indefinitely reinvest in foreign operations. The Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. It is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such
earnings were distributed in the future, due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

The Company had
valuation allowances of $3.2 million and $4.3 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to foreign net operating losses for which realization is uncertain.

As of December 31, 2016 the Company had $199.8 million of UTBs of which $157.4 million represents the amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate
in future periods.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of UTBs is as follows:

The Company classifies interest related to UTBs in interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties, if incurred,
would be recognized in other non-operating expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred a net interest expense of $6.2 million and $7.2 million respectively, related to UTBs. As of December 31, 2016 and
2015, the amount of accrued interest recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet related to UTB’s was $34.1 million and $27.9 million, respectively.

Moody’s Corporation and subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company
settled U.S. tax audit years 2008 through 2010 in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2011 and 2012 are under examination and its 2013, 2014 and 2015 returns remain open to examination. The
Company’s New York State income tax returns for 2011 to 2014 are under examination. The Company’s New York City tax returns for 2014 and 2015 remain open to examination. The Company’s U.K. tax return for 2012 is under examination. Tax
filings in the U.K. remain open to examination for 2013 through 2015.

For current ongoing audits related to open tax years, the Company estimates that it is possible
that the balance of UTPs could decrease in the next twelve months as a result of the effective settlement of these audits, which might involve the payment of additional taxes, the adjustment of certain deferred taxes and/or the recognition of tax
benefits. It is also possible that new issues might be raised by tax authorities which might necessitate increases to the balance of UTPs. As the Company is unable to predict the timing of conclusion of these audits, the Company is unable to
estimate the amount of changes to the balance of UTPs at this time.

Credit Facility

On May 11, 2015, the
Company entered into a five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility with the capacity to borrow up to $1 billion. This replaces the $1 billion five-year 2012 Facility that was scheduled to expire in April 2017. Interest on borrowings under
the facility is payable at rates that are based on the LIBOR plus a premium that can range from 79.5 basis points to 120 basis points per annum depending on the Company’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA. The Company also pays quarterly facility
fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the 2015 Facility. The quarterly fees for the 2015 Facility can range from 8 basis points of the facility amount to 17.5 basis points, depending on the Company’s Debt/ EBITDA ratio. The 2015 Facility
contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates, sale and leaseback transactions
or to incur liens, as set forth in the facility agreement. The 2015 Facility also contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Upon the occurrence
of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events of default constituting a default under the 2015 Facility, all loans outstanding under the 2015 Facility (including accrued interest and fees payable
thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all lending commitments under the 2015 Facility may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the 2015 Facility would automatically result in amounts outstanding
becoming immediately due and payable and the termination of all lending commitments.

Commercial Paper

On
August 3, 2016, the Company entered into a private placement commercial paper program under which the Company may issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the CP Program are backstopped by the 2015 Facility.
Amounts under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The maturity of the CP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The CP Notes are sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, sold at par and bear interest at rates that
will vary based upon market conditions. The rates of interest will depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) certificate of deposit rate;
(b) commercial paper rate; (c) the federal funds rate; (d) the LIBOR; (e) prime rate; (f) Treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement to the private placement agreement. The CP Program
contains certain events of default including, among other things: non-payment of principal, interest or fees; entrance into any form of moratorium; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain instances to cure periods. The Company has
not borrowed under this program through December 31, 2016. Through February 22, 2017, the Company has CP borrowings outstanding of $566.0 million with a weighted average maturity and interest rate of 63 days and 1.18%, respectively.

Notes Payable

On September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold
through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.06% Series 2007-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 pursuant to the 2007 Agreement. The Series 2007-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at
an annual rate of 6.06%, payable semi-annually on March 7 and September 7. The Company may prepay the Series 2007-1 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and a Make Whole Amount. The 2007 Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: enter into transactions with affiliates, dispose of assets, incur or
create liens, enter into any sale-leaseback transactions, or merge with any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. The Company must also not permit its Debt/EBITDA ratio to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 at the end
of any fiscal quarter.

On August 19, 2010, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a public offering. The 2010
Senior Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% and mature on September 1, 2020. Interest on the 2010 Senior Notes will be due semi-annually on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2011. The Company may
prepay the 2010 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make-Whole Amount. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the notes, the
Company may be required to purchase all or a portion of the notes upon occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event,” as defined in the 2010 Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The 2010 Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In
addition, the 2010 Indenture contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company to consolidate or merge with another entity or to sell all or substantially all of its assets to another entity. The 2010 Indenture contains customary default
provisions. In addition, an event of default will occur if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fail to pay the principal of any indebtedness (as defined in the 2010 Indenture) when due at maturity in an aggregate amount of $50 million or
more, or a default occurs that results in the acceleration of the maturity of the Company’s or certain of its subsidiaries’ indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an
event of default under the 2010 Indenture, the notes may become immediately due and payable either automatically or by the vote of the holders of more than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the notes then outstanding.

On November 4, 2011, in connection with the acquisition of Copal, a subsidiary of the Company issued a $14.2 million non-interest bearing note to the sellers which
represented a portion of the consideration transferred to acquire the Copal entities. If a seller subsequently transfers to the Company all of its shares, the Company must repay the seller its proportion of the principal on the later of (i) the
fourth anniversary date of the note or (ii) within a time frame set forth in the acquisition agreement relating to the resolution of certain income tax uncertainties pertaining to the transaction. The Company has the right to offset payment of
the note against certain indemnification assets associated with UTPs related to the acquisition. Accordingly, the Company has offset the liability for this note against the indemnification asset, thus no balance for this note is carried on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 and 2015. In the event that the Company would not be required to settle amounts related to the UTPs, the Company would be required to pay the sellers the principal in accordance
with the note agreement. The Company may prepay the note in accordance with certain terms set forth in the acquisition agreement.

or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make-Whole Amount. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the notes, the Company may be required to purchase all or
a portion of the notes upon occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event,” as defined in the 2012 Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of the principal

As more fully described in Note 25, the Company notified holders of these notes that it intends to prepay the notes on March 20, 2017.

The Company entered into interest rate swaps on the 2010 Senior Notes, 2012 Senior Notes and the 2014 Senior Notes (5-year), which are more fully discussed in Note 5.

At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. In addition to the covenants described
above, the 2015 Facility, 2015 Senior Notes, 2014 Senior Notes (5-year), 2014 Senior Notes (30-year), the Series 2007-1 Notes, the 2010 Senior Notes, the 2012 Senior Notes and the 2013 Senior Notes contain cross default provisions. These provisions
state that default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2016,
there are no such cross defaults.

Share Repurchase Program

The
Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5-1 program. Moody’s may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant. As a result, Moody’s share repurchase
activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. The table below summarizes the Company’s remaining authority under its share repurchase program as of December 31, 2016:

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Moody’s operates its business from various leased facilities, which are under operating
leases that expire over the next 11 years. Moody’s also leases certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next four years. Rent expense, including lease incentives, is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the related lease term. Rent expense under operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $95.4 million, $87.6 million and $83.9 million, respectively.

The 21-year operating lease for the Company’s headquarters at 7WTC which commenced on October 20, 2006 contains a total of 20 years of renewal options. These
renewal options apply to both the original lease as well as additional floors leased by the Company beginning in 2014. Additionally, the 17.5 year operating lease for the Company’s London, England office which commenced on February 6, 2008
contains a total of 15 years of renewal options.

NOTE 19

CONTINGENCIES

Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations and inquiries,
claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the
Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine
to be appropriate.

Following the global credit crisis of 2008, MIS and other credit rating agencies have been the subject of intense scrutiny, increased regulation,
ongoing inquiry and governmental investigations, and civil litigation. Legislative, regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation, regulation and enforcement actions, including with respect to MIS’s
compliance with regulatory standards. Moody’s periodically receives and is continuing to address subpoenas and inquiries from various governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries.

In a letter dated September 29, 2016, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) stated that it was preparing a civil complaint to be filed against
Moody’s and MIS in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging certain violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act in connection with the ratings MIS assigned to residential mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized debt obligations in the period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. On January 13, 2017, the Company, along with its subsidiaries MIS and MA, announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with
the United States, acting through the DOJ and the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, along with the States of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Washington, and the District of Columbia (collectively, the “States”), acting through their respective Attorneys
General or state securities regulator, as applicable, to resolve pending and potential civil claims related to credit ratings that MIS assigned to certain structured finance instruments in the financial crisis era. The agreement also related to
certain statements made in connection with Moody’s structured finance rating methodologies and procedures during the same period. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to pay $437.5 million to the United States as
a civil monetary penalty and $426.3 million in aggregate to the States. The Company also agreed to maintain a number of existing compliance measures and to implement and maintain certain additional compliance measures over the next five years.
The Settlement Agreement contained no findings of violations of law by Moody’s, MIS or MA nor any admission of liability, and is final and not conditioned on court approval. The complete terms of the settlement are reflected in the settlement
agreement attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Form 8-K filed by the Company on January 17, 2017.

In addition, the Company is facing litigation from market
participants relating to the performance of MIS-rated securities. Although Moody’s in the normal course experiences such litigation, the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased following the events in the U.S.
subprime residential mortgage sector and global credit markets more broadly over the last decade.

For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental
investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and
periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within
the range. In other instances, where a loss is reasonably possible, management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, but discloses the contingency if significant. As
additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and
inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot
predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive
position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome
of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some such matters, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and
uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.

NOTE 20

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company is organized into three operating segments: (i) MIS, (ii) MA and
(iii) Moody’s Analytics Knowledge Services. The MAKS operating segment has been aggregated with the MA operating segment based on the fact that it has similar economic characteristics to MA. Accordingly, the Company reports in two
reportable segments: MIS and MA.

In January 2014, the Company revised its operating segments to create the new Copal Amba operating segment. The new operating
segment consists of all operations from Copal and the operations of Amba which was acquired in December 2013. In December 2016, the Copal Amba operating segment was rebranded as MAKS. The MAKS operating segment provides research and analytic
services to the global financial and corporate sectors. The Company has determined that the MAKS and MA operating segments have similar economic characteristics as set forth in ASC 280. As such, MAKS has been combined with MA to form the MA
reportable segment and revenue from MAKS is reported in the PS LOB.

The MIS segment consists of five LOBs. The CFG, SFG, FIG and PPIF LOBs generate revenue
principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. The MIS Other LOB primarily consists of the distribution of research and
financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as ICRA non-ratings revenue.

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services
that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. The MA segment consists of three LOBs - RD&A, ERS and PS.

Revenue for MIS and expenses for MA include an intersegment royalty charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. The
royalty rate charged by MIS approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content, data and products and is generally based on comparable market transactions. Also, revenue for MA and expenses for MIS include an intersegment fee charged to MIS
from MA for certain MA products and services utilized in MIS’s ratings process. These fees charged by MA are generally equal to the costs incurred by MA to produce these products and services. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses
of the Company that exclusively benefit only one segment are fully charged to that segment. Overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company that benefit both segments are allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology.
Accordingly, a reportable segment’s share of these costs will increase as its proportion of revenue relative to Moody’s total revenue increases. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support
staff such as finance, human resources and information technology. “Eliminations” in the table below represent intersegment revenue/expense. Moody’s does not report the Company’s assets by reportable segment, as this metric is
not used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by reportable segment.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY SEGMENT:

The table below shows revenue, Adjusted
Operating Income and operating income by reportable segment. Adjusted Operating Income is a financial metric utilized by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to assess the profitability of each reportable segment.

segments are $10.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. The charge in MA reflects cost management initiatives in certain corporate overhead functions of which a portion is allocated to MA based on a revenue-split methodology.
