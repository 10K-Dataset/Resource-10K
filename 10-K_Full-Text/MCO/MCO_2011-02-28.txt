PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

BACKGROUND

As used in this report, except where the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Moody’s” or the “Company” refer to
Moody’s Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. The Company’s executive offices are located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10007 and its telephone number is (212) 553-0300. Prior to
September 30, 2000, the Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation.

THE COMPANY

Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) risk
management software and (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, credit portfolio management solutions, training and financial credentialing and certification services. In 2007 and prior years, Moody’s operated in two reportable segments:
Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV. Beginning in January 2008, Moody’s segments were changed to reflect the Reorganization announced in August 2007 and Moody’s now reports in two new reportable segments: MIS and
Moody’s Analytics. As a result of the Reorganization, the rating agency remains in the MIS operating segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moody’s other non-rating commercial activities are included within
the new MA segment. Financial information and operating results of these segments, including revenue, expenses, operating income and total assets, are included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements of this annual report, and are herein
incorporated by reference.

MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such
obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. Revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings to
support the distribution of their debt issues to investors. MIS provides ratings in more than 110 countries. Ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media, including the Internet and
real-time information systems widely used by securities traders and investors. As of December 31, 2010, MIS had ratings relationships with approximately 11,000 corporate issuers and approximately 22,000 public finance issuers. Additionally, the
Company has rated and currently monitors ratings on approximately 102,000 structured finance obligations (representing approximately 15,000 transactions). The aforementioned amounts relating to the number of issuers and transactions represent
issuers or transactions that had an active rating at any point during the year ended December 31, 2010. The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in
global financial markets. Within its Research, Data and Analytics business, MA distributes investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies,
commentary on topical credit related events and also provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores. Within its Risk Management Software business, MA provides both economic and regulatory
capital risk management software and implementation services. Within its Professional Services business it provides quantitative credit risk measures, credit portfolio management solutions, training and financial credentialing and certification
services. MA customers represent more than 4,100 institutions worldwide operating in approximately 115 countries. During 2010 Moody’s research web site was accessed by over 185,000 individuals including 27,000 client users.

The Company operated as part of “Old D&B” until September 30, 2000, when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies –
Moody’s Corporation and New D&B. At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company. The remaining
business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services and was renamed Moody’s Corporation. For purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between the
Company and New D&B after the 2000 Distribution and to provide for an orderly transition, the Company and New D&B entered into various agreements including a distribution agreement, tax allocation agreement and employee benefits agreement.

PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH

Over recent decades, global fixed-income markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities or other obligations. Beginning in mid-2007 there was a severe market
disruption and decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes of securities in the U.S. and internationally. Despite the market disruption, Moody’s believes that the overall long-term outlook remains favorable for continued
secular growth of fixed-income markets worldwide. Moody’s business prospects correspond closely to the health of the world’s major economies and capital markets. Throughout 2010 there were signs of recovery in the U.S. economy while the
global economy has been more volatile with European sovereign debt and related banking sector concerns offset by strong economic growth in emerging markets. Continued improvement of the U.S. economy and housing sector, specifically, along with the
stabilization of the European sovereign debt concerns should influence the Company’s growth over the near term. Moody’s is well positioned to benefit from a long-term recovery in global credit market activity and a more informed use of
credit ratings, research and related analytical products in an environment of renewed attention to risk analysis and risk management. Moody’s expects that these developments will support continued long-term demand for high-quality, independent
credit opinions, research, data and risk management tools and services. An expectation of recovery-driven growth in capital market activity, supported by initiatives to increase market share, leverage pricing opportunities, capture disintermediation
activity in developed and developing markets and develop additional data, research and rating products, represent key growth drivers for Moody’s.

Growth in global fixed-income markets is attributable to a number of forces and trends. Advances in information technology make information about investment
alternatives widely available throughout the world. Technology facilitates issuers’ ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors’ capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national
markets. Technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell, which in the absence of the appropriate
technology may not be easily obtainable. This availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and development of worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible, globally comparable opinions about credit risk. As a result,
existing capital markets have expanded and a number of new capital markets have emerged. In addition, more issuers and investors are accessing developed capital markets. Information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global
platform to support Moody’s continued expansion in developing markets.

Another trend in the world’s capital markets is the disintermediation
of financial systems. Issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets, in addition to, or in substitution for, traditional financial intermediaries. Moreover, financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public
capital markets, in addition to or instead of retaining those assets. Recent credit market disruptions have slowed the trend of disintermediation globally, but Moody’s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and
efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems. Thus, disintermediation is expected to accelerate in the longer-term, with Moody’s continuing to target investment and resources to growing international markets where disintermediation
and bond issuance should remain more robust.

The strong growth trend seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid-1990’s
reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil, with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010. The market disruptions that escalated in 2008 are expected to continue in the immediate term, however Moody’s expects to see some revenue
stabilization from this market in the future. Despite significant declines from peak market levels, Moody’s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global credit markets, and provide opportunities for longer
term revenue growth. Moody’s will continue to monitor this market and adapt to meet the changing needs of its participants.

Rating fees paid by
debt issuers account for most of the revenue of MIS. Therefore, a substantial portion of MIS’s revenue is dependent upon the dollar-equivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets. MIS’s results
can be affected by factors such as the performance, and the prospects for growth, of the major world economies, the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments, and the decisions of issuers to request MIS ratings to aid investors in
their investment decision process. However, annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers, annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and medium-term note programs, bank and insurance company financial strength ratings,
mutual fund ratings, subscription-based research and other areas partially mitigate MIS’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global capital markets.

Moody’s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in conducting business internationally. Such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization, expropriation, exchange and price
controls, changes in the availability of data from public sector sources, limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions. Management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced
because the Company’s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information, rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources. However, the formation of, for example, a new
government-sponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to MIS’s growth prospects. Management believes that this risk, compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry, is relatively low
because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required, with uncertainty about the likelihood of financial success for the entity.

MOODY’S

2010 10-K



Legislative bodies and regulators in the U.S., Europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory
reviews of CRAs, which may result in, for example, an increased number of competitors, changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of MIS, or increased costs of doing business for MIS. Therefore, in order to broaden
the potential for expansion of non-ratings services, Moody’s reorganized in January 2008 into two distinct businesses: MIS, consisting solely of the ratings business, and MA. MA conducts all non-ratings activities including the sale of credit
research produced by MIS and the production and sale of other economic and credit-related products and services. The reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by MA into activities which may have otherwise
been restricted for MIS, due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business. At present, Moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities.

MA expects to benefit from the growing demand among credit market participants for information that enables them to make sound investment and risk
management decisions. These customers require advanced qualitative and quantitative tools to support their management of increasingly complex capital market instruments. Such complexity creates analytical challenges for market participants,
including financial intermediaries, asset managers and other investors. In recent years, reliable third-party ratings and research served to supplement or substitute for traditional in-house research as the scale, geographic scope and complexity of
financial markets grew. MA remains focused on driving improvements in customer retention, product placements and new customer acquisition in this area. Credit market conditions improved in 2010, helping to raise customer retention level after a
period of higher than normal customer attrition in MA.

Growth in MA is also expected as financial institutions adopt active credit portfolio management
practices and implement internal credit assessment tools for compliance with Basel II regulations. MA offers products that respond to these needs. This growth will be realized by, for example, the development of new private firm default probability
models for specific countries and by expanding analysis capabilities of new asset classes.

The 2010 acquisition of CSI Global Education, Inc.,
Canada’s leading provider of financial learning, credentials and certification, strengthens MA’s capabilities for delivering credit training programs, and represents another means for the Company to pursue its objectives of enhancing risk
management practices, furthering financial education and promoting efficiency in the capital markets.

COMPETITION

The MIS business competes with other CRAs and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research. Many users of
MIS’s ratings also have in-house credit research capabilities. Moody’s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is Standard & Poor’s, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. There are some rating markets,
based on industry, geography and/or instrument type, in which Moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to S&P’s while in other markets, the reverse is true.

In addition to S&P, MIS’s competitors include Fitch, Dominion Bond Rating Service Ltd. of Canada, A.M. Best Company Inc, Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd.,
Rating and Investment Information Inc. of Japan and Egan-Jones Ratings Company. In 2008 two more firms were granted the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations status in the U.S: LACE Financial Corp. and Realpoint LLC. In 2010 these
two firms were acquired by Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. and Morningstar, Inc., respectively, to enable them to compete as NRSROs. Additional rating agencies may emerge in the U.S. as the SEC continues to expand the number of NRSROs. Other
competition may arise in the U.S. from credit opinion providers who do not operate as NRSRO’s, such as Bloomberg. Competition may also increase in developed or developing markets outside the U.S. over the next few years as the number of rating
agencies may increase, although a more regulated credit ratings industry, both in the U.S. and internationally, may provide for a less appealing expansion opportunity.

The increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for Moody’s. Global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise, but regulatory actions may result
in a greater number of rating agencies and/or additional regulation of Moody’s and its competitors. Alternatively, banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations, thereby reducing certain elements
of demand for ratings, or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies.

Credit rating agencies such as MIS also compete with
other means of managing credit risk, such as credit insurance. Competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to Moody’s.

MA competes broadly in the financial information space against diversified competitors such as Thomson-Reuters, Bloomberg, RiskMetrics, S&P, Fitch, Dun & Bradstreet, and Markit Group among others.
MA’s main competitors within RD&A include S&P, Fitch Algorithmics, CreditSights, Thomson-Reuters, Intex, IHS Global Insight, BlackRock Solutions and other smaller boutique providers of fixed income analytics, valuations, economic data
and research. In RMS, MA faces competition from Fitch Algorithmics, SunGard, SAS, Oracle and other various smaller vendors and in-house solutions. Within professional services, MA competes with Oliver Wyman for certain credit risk advisory services,
with Omega Performance, DC Gardner, and a host of boutique providers for financial training.

MOODY’S STRATEGY

Moody’s continues to follow growth strategies that adapt to market conditions and capitalize on emerging opportunities.

Given recent market turmoil, Moody’s immediate focus is on making effective business decisions to adapt to challenging economic, market and regulatory conditions while positioning the Company to benefit from
gradual recovery in global credit market activity.

Given the renewed attention to risk analysis and risk management, Moody’s is committed to
further encouraging the informed use of credit ratings, research and related analytics products.

Moody’s seeks to differentiate itself from
incumbent and potential competitors with predictive, uniquely thoughtful and forward-looking opinions about credit and the credit industry.

Adapting to
market changes is a key factor in maintaining market relevance. Moody’s continuously monitors opportunities to selectively diversify its revenue base through organic growth and acquisitions, in order to replace areas of lost revenue and
position the Company for new sources of business.

In support of those goals Moody’s intends to continue its focus in the following areas:

Expansion in Financial Centers

Moody’s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations. Moody’s currently maintains comprehensive rating and commercial operations in financial centers including
Beijing, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan, Moscow, New York, Paris, Sao Paolo, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo and Toronto. Moody’s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from
the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue. Moody’s also expects that the growth of its MIS business in Europe will return once there is clarity on the resolution of the European sovereign debt crisis. Additionally,
Moody’s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures. This will allow Moody’s to extend its credit opinion franchise to local and regional obligors, through domestic currency ratings
and national scale ratings.

New Rating Products

Moody’s continues to respond to investor demand for new products and enhancements. In the recent market turmoil, attention to core strengths has been crucial and enhancements have and continue to be focused on
quality and transparency. Given the particular disruption in the structured finance markets, MIS has been developing enhanced structured finance offerings to meet investor demands for more information content. Leveraging the diversity of its
research data and analytics, Moody’s has introduced cross-sector analysis to better illustrate the broader impacts of recent market events. This is further enhanced by the incorporation of macroeconomics to frame conditions and assumptions. MIS
continues to capitalize on market developments and enhance ratings surveillance efficiency, focusing on new ratings products and to identify, design, develop and maintain value-added research, analytics and data products serving the capital markets.

Internet-Enhanced Products and Services

Moody’s is expanding its use of the Internet and other electronic media to enhance customer service. The Company’s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides the public and
subscribers with credit research and risk assessment tools. Internet delivery also enables Moody’s to provide services to more individuals within a customer organization and to offer higher-value services because of more timely delivery.
Moody’s expects that access to these applications will increase customer use of the Company’s services. Moody’s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities.

Expansion of Credit Research Products and Investment Analytic Tools

Moody’s plans to expand its research and analytic services through internal development and potentially through acquisitions. Most new product initiatives are more analytical and data-intensive than
traditional narrative research offerings. Such services address investor interest in replicating the types of monitoring activities conducted by Moody’s analysts and provide the means for customers to gain access to raw data and financial
statistics and ratios used by MIS in the rating process for municipalities, companies and financial institutions. These products represent important sources of growth for MA’s RD&A business. MA is developing products in the fixed-income
valuations and pricing arena that facilitate price transparency in global fixed income markets, especially for complex structured securities and derivative instruments. Moreover, Moody’s continues to pursue opportunities to extend its research
relevance in new domestic or regional markets (e.g., China) as well as new functional markets (e.g., hedge funds).

New Quantitative
Credit Risk Assessment Services

Moody’s will continue to provide banks and other institutions with quantitative credit risk
assessment solutions. The Company believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they assist customers trading or holding credit-sensitive assets to better manage risk and deliver better performance. Also, international bank
regulatory authorities are assessing the

MOODY’S

2010 10-K



adequacy of banks’ internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital. The acquisition of Fermat in 2008 accelerated Moody’s capabilities in this
area. Such regulatory initiatives create demand for, and encourage adoption of, related services by banks from third-party providers.

REGULATION

In the U.S., since 1975, MIS has been designated as an NRSRO by the SEC. The SEC first applied the NRSRO designation in that year to
companies whose credit ratings could be used by broker-dealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements. Since that time, Congress, the SEC and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of NRSROs to distinguish
between “investment-grade” and “non-investment-grade” securities, among other purposes.

In September 2006, the Credit Rating Agency
Reform Act of 2006 was passed, which created a voluntary registration process for rating agencies wishing to be designated as NRSROs. The Reform Act provided the SEC with authority to oversee NRSROs, while prohibiting the SEC from regulating the
substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any NRSRO determines credit ratings. In June 2007, the SEC published its first set of rules implementing the Reform Act. These rules address the NRSRO application and
registration process, as well as oversight rules related to recordkeeping, financial reporting, prevention of misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest, and prohibited acts and practices. In February 2009, the SEC published a
second set of rules applicable to NRSROs, the majority of which provide requirements for managing conflicts of interest, enhancing record keeping requirements, and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. In November 2009,
the SEC published a third set of final rules for NRSROs. These rules, which came into force in June 2010, require additional disclosure of rating histories and prohibit NRSROs from rating structured finance products unless the issuer makes the same
information accessible to all NRSROs that it provides to an NRSRO hired to determine the rating. In 2009, the SEC also determined to eliminate references to NRSRO ratings in certain regulations, retain some references and seek additional comments on
other references.

MIS has been registered as an NRSRO with the SEC under the Exchange Act as of September 2007, and as of that time MIS has been subject
to the SEC’s oversight rules described above. As required by the rules, MIS has made its Form NRSRO Initial Application, its Annual Certification of Form NRSRO, and any associated updates publicly available by posting it on the Regulatory
Affairs page of the Company’s website.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The
subtitle of the Financial Reform Act that addresses the CRA industry is Title IX, Subtitle C. This subtitle seeks, among other things, to enhance transparency and accountability in the credit rating agency industry, and to reduce the regulatory
reliance on credit ratings. The majority of the provisions of Subtitle C of Title IX of the Financial Reform Act seek to regulate the activities of those CRAs that are registered under the SEC’s regulatory framework for NRSROs. Therefore, these
provisions will apply to any CRAs in MIS’s corporate family that fall under the NRSRO regime.

Provisions of the Financial Reform Act applicable to
NRSROs include, among others:

•

heightened compliance standards, including the adoption of enhanced corporate governance and conflicts of interest policies and procedures, implementation of
professional standards for credit analysts and periodic compliance examinations;

•

increased public disclosures, including disclosure of the ratings process and methodology, factors relied upon in formulating ratings, results of third-party due
diligence and accuracy of prior ratings;

•

replacement of references to credit ratings in certain federal laws with broader references to the “credit-worthiness” of a security;

•

a mandate that the SEC study the feasibility of establishing a system in which a utility or a self-regulatory organization assigns NRSROs to determine the credit
ratings of structured finance products to address so-called “rating-shopping” by issuers and underwriters of structured financial products; and

•

rescission of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), which provided NRSROs with an exemption from expert liability under
the Securities Act for ratings information included in registration statements.

Certain of the above mentioned provisions were
effective immediately. These include provisions that potentially impact CRAs’ liability environment. The enhanced regulatory regime for CRAs could potentially increase the costs associated with the operation of a CRA and increase the legal risk
associated with the issuance of credit ratings. Moreover, it is possible that the number of legal proceedings, especially as related to future ratings, may increase materially and the potential exposure of CRAs thereunder may also increase. It is
possi-


MOODY’S

2010 10-K


ble that implementing changes to the Company’s operations to address the changed liability environment may result in lower revenues and/or increased expenses and may significantly change the
manner in which the Company conducts its credit rating business.

The majority of the provisions in the Financial Reform Act as it pertains to CRAs are
to be implemented through rule-making by the SEC and other regulatory authorities. The SEC has published a schedule for its rule making activity over the coming year, and it appears that the majority of the rule-making as it pertains to the CRA
industry will be conducted and completed in the first half of 2011. Specifically, the SEC has indicated that it expects to propose various rules for NRSROs to implement the relevant provisions of the Financial Reform Act before the end of March
2011. One provision that the SEC has already implemented, in accordance with the mandated time-line under the Financial Reform Act, is the elimination of the specific exemption from Regulation Fair Disclosure for information provided by issuers to
CRAs, for the purpose of developing a rating.

In addition, the SEC has several pending rule proposals on CRAs, including: 1) a rule proposal to require
disclosure about credit ratings when ratings are used in connection with the sale of registered securities; 2) a rule proposal regarding the NRSRO compliance function and disclosure about revenues received for credit rating services; and 3) rule
proposals regarding structured finance regulations. In January 2011, the SEC adopted a rule, which will come into effect on September 26, 2011, requiring NRSROs to disclose information about the representations and warranties of the structured
finance securities they rate. The bank regulators also have begun their rule making activities, and in October 2010 they closed a comment period requesting views from market participants on alternatives to credit ratings that could be incorporated
into banking supervision. MIS and MA both provided comments, and these can be found on the Company’s website.

Finally, as part of the ongoing
debate surrounding the financial crisis, MIS participated in a hearing held by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (“FCIC”) on June 2, 2010. The FCIC’s report and two dissenting opinions were published on January 27,
2011.

Internationally, several regulatory developments have occurred:

The G-8 and the G-20—In November 2008, the Heads of State of the G-20 reached agreement on a wide-ranging set of proposals to better regulate financial systems. Among other things, the G-20 committed to
implement oversight of the CRAs, consistent with the strengthened International Organization of Securities Commissions’ Code of Conduct (see below) and agreed that, in the medium term, the countries should implement a registration system for
CRAs. The G-20 also committed to formulate their regulations and other measures in a consistent manner and recommended that IOSCO review CRAs’ adoption of the standards and mechanisms for monitoring compliance. On April 2, 2009, the G-20
Heads of State meeting was held in London, where the G-20 provided a six-part action plan to address the financial crisis: (1) to restore confidence, growth, and jobs; (2) to repair the financial system to restore lending; (3) to
strengthen financial regulation and rebuild trust; (4) to fund and reform international financial institutions to overcome the current crisis and prevent future ones; (5) to promote global trade and investment and reject protectionism; and
(6) to build an inclusive, green, and sustainable recovery. The G-20’s plan also contains a number of provisions that are specific to CRAs. In particular, the G-20 member states agreed to extend regulatory oversight to and require
registration of CRAs in order to ensure that they adhere to the international code of good practice. On July 10, 2009, the G-8 restated its commitment to implement the G-20’s statement.

In September 2009, the G-20 met in Pittsburgh and developed a progress report on actions to promote global financial regulatory reform. With respect to CRAs, the
G-20 acknowledged that stronger oversight regimes for CRAs have been developed in the EU, the U.S. and Japan, and recognized that the development of good practices for due diligence by asset managers investing in structured finance products will
result in reduced reliance on credit ratings. The G-20 also expressed concern about the creation of globally inconsistent regulations.

More recently, on
October 23, 2010, the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors met in Seoul, Korea in preparation for the November 2010 meeting of the G-20 Heads of State. Broadly, the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors have agreed to
continue to work in cooperation with one another. In advance of this meeting, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published a report and a statement, respectively with the FSB publishing a more detailed
report on October 27, 2010. As pertaining to CRAs, both institutions advocate that governments reduce their reliance on credit ratings in regulation. While both entities acknowledge that the process will take time, they believe that the
mechanistic use of ratings by governments should over time be discontinued.

IOSCO—In December 2004, the Technical Committee of IOSCO published its
Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies. In May 2008, IOSCO published the revised IOSCO Code. The changes made to the IOSCO Code broadly address greater transparency of methodologies and processes by CRAs. In July 2008, IOSCO also
announced that it will monitor the CRAs implementation of the IOSCO Code changes and it will explore the means by which IOSCO members might work together to verify the proper and complete disclosure by CRAs of information required by the IOSCO Code.

On March 12, 2009, IOSCO published its second review of the CRAs implementation of the IOSCO Code. The report noted that seven out of the 21 CRAs
reviewed had implemented the IOSCO Code in their own codes of conduct. In particular, MIS was found to have substantially implemented the 2008 revisions to the IOSCO Code. In addition, IOSCO announced the establishment of a new standing committee
that will address global issues regarding the CRA industry.

MIS has revised its Code of Professional Conduct (fashioned on the IOSCO Code) on several occasions to reflect the
changes made to the IOSCO Code and the broader changes in the regulatory environment for CRAs. Beginning in 2006, MIS has annually published a report that describes its implementation of its Code. The MIS Code and implementation reports can be found
on the Company’s website.

EU—In late April 2009, the European Parliament voted and passed a new regulation (“EU Regulation”) that
establishes an oversight regime for the CRA industry in the European Union. The framework for the EU Regulation requires the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of CRAs operating in the EU. The EU Regulation also sets out
specific requirements for the use of ratings that are produced outside of the EU and used for regulatory purposes in the EU. Among these is a requirement for the relevant competent authority in the EU and the competent authority of the non-EU
jurisdiction where that rating has been produced to enter into a cooperation agreement containing provisions related to the exchange of information and the coordination of supervisory activities. At this time it is too early to give a more precise
assessment of the impact of the EU Regulation on MIS. The Company expects that there will be increases in our operational and compliance costs on a one-time and recurring basis. In addition, the European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) was
established in January 2011, and will have direct supervisory responsibility for the CRA industry in the EU. It is expected to be fully operational by June 2011. Also, the regulatory framework of the CRA industry continues to be discussed in the
European Union. The European Commission recently published a consultation document on the need for additional measures to supervise the CRA industry and the European Parliament is debating and modifying an Own Initiative Report on the topic.
MIS’s response to the Commission’s consultation document can be found on the Company’s website. Among the issues being debated are the issuer-pay business model, use of ratings in regulation, sovereign ratings, competition and
CRAs’ liability environment. It is expected that in the near future the European Commission will publish a proposal for additional regulation that will consider some or all of these topics.

The Basel Committee—In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a bank capital adequacy framework, called Basel II, to replace its
initial 1988 framework. Under Basel II, ratings assigned by recognized CRAs or ECAIs, can be used by banks in determining credit risk weights for many of their institutional credit exposures. Recognized ECAIs could be subject to a broader range of
oversight. National authorities have begun the ECAI recognition process. MIS has been recognized as an ECAI in several jurisdictions and the recognition process is ongoing in many others. As a result of the recent developments in the financial
markets, the banking authorities of the Basel Committee have been reconsidering the overall framework. Work on the new framework, Basel III, substantially has been completed. It is to be implemented in stages, beginning in 2010 and concluding in
2018. Basel III continues to use credit ratings as a tool in bank supervision.

Other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research
services is being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future. In addition, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating
agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. If enacted, any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape
in which MIS operates. The legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future. Management of MIS cannot predict whether
these or any other proposals will be enacted, the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings, or regulatory or legislative actions, or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position, financial position or
results of operations of Moody’s.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors and other
information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or
that the Company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially
adversely affected.

Laws and Regulations Affecting the Credit Rating Industry are Rapidly Evolving and May Negatively Impact the Nature and
Economics of the Company’s Business

Credit rating agencies are regulated in both the U.S. and in other countries (including by state and
local authorities). Over the past few years, many jurisdictions have adopted or proposed new laws and regulations that impact the operation of credit rating agencies and the markets for securities that are rated. Additional laws and regulations have
been proposed or are being considered, and further legislation or regulation may be proposed or implemented in the future. Some of the more prominent developments are discussed below or under the section entitled “Regulation” in Part I,
Item 1 of this Form 10-K. These laws and regulations are intended to cause, or may result in, increased competition in the credit rating business. In addition, these laws or regulations may cause or result in (i) alternatives to credit ratings,
(ii) regulations or restrictions on how information is used in the development or maintenance of credit ratings, (iii) increased regulatory oversight of the credit markets and credit rating agency operation, or (iv) changes in the pricing of
credit ratings. All of these items could result in an increase in costs that Moody’s may not be able to pass through to customers and a decrease in the demand for or changes in the use of credit ratings.

New pleading and liability standards that have been adopted in the U.S. and proposed elsewhere potentially subject credit rating agencies to a greater number of
legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities, could result in such legal proceedings continuing for a greater period of time before being resolved, and could result in increased uncertainty over and
exposure to liability of credit rating agencies. As new laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies rapidly evolve, the costs of compliance is expected to increase, and Moody’s may not be able to pass on these costs
through the pricing of its services. In addition, there may be greater uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of new laws and regulations, which may increase compliance costs and increase the possibility of fines, penalties or
other sanctions (including restrictions on activities) being imposed.

Given the comparatively recent adoption and the number of additional reforms that
have been or will be adopted, including those under the legislative and regulatory initiatives discussed below, Moody’s is unable to accurately assess the future impact of any regulatory changes that may result or the impact on Moody’s
competitive position or its current practices. Although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally, they may affect Moody’s in a disproportionate manner. Responding to
these developments will increase Moody’s fixed and variable costs of operations, perhaps to a degree that is significantly greater than Moody’s currently expects, and Moody’s may not be able to pass through or otherwise recoup such
costs. These developments may alter MIS’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which MIS’s ratings are developed, assigned and communicated, and decrease demand or affect the manner in
which MIS or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, and alter the economics of the credit ratings business, including by restricting or mandating the business models under which a rating agency is permitted to operate. Moody’s stock
price may also be affected by speculation regarding legislative and regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on Moody’s business and by increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations. Each
of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact Moody’s operations or profitability, the Company’s ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for
credit ratings, in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which Moody’s operates in ways that cannot presently be predicted.

In the U.S., MIS is designated as an NRSRO pursuant to SEC regulations adopted under the Reform Act. One of the central tenets of the Reform Act was to encourage
competition among rating agencies. The Reform Act established standards for the SEC to have direct jurisdiction over credit rating agencies that seek NRSRO status and to inspect their operations.

In the U.S., one of the tenets of the recently enacted Financial Reform Act is that credit rating agencies perform a “gatekeeper” role and should be
subject to enhanced oversight standards that could result in enhanced liability. The Financial Reform Act amends a number of laws and regulations, requires the SEC to adopt a number of rules affecting rating agencies and the use of credit ratings,
especially in structured finance markets, and authorizes a number of studies relating to the operations and legal standards applicable to CRAs. Provisions of the Financial Reform Act and other rules that may be adopted by the SEC in furtherance of
the Financial Reform Act that pose risks to the Company’s business include, among others:

•

heightened compliance standards;

•

increased disclosure obligations;

•

provisions seeking to diminish regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings;

MOODY’S

2010 10-K



•

rules potentially mandating disclosure of sensitive issuer information provided to CRAs for the purpose of developing a rating;

•

a mandate that the SEC study the feasibility of establishing a system in which a utility or a self-regulatory organization assigns NRSROs to determine the credit
ratings of structured finance products to address so-called “rating-shopping” by issuers and underwriters of structured financial products; and

•

changes to the pleading standards and, by repealing Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act, the liability standards under the federal securities laws if a CRA
consents to have a rating included in a registration statement or prospectus.

The Financial Reform Act rescission of Rule 436(g) under
the Securities Act, which was an exemption from expert liability under the Securities Act for ratings information included in registration statements, could impact Moody’s in a number of ways. SEC rules relating to offerings of asset-backed
securities that are registered with the SEC require certain disclosures regarding credit ratings if, as is common in the market for such securities, the issuance or sale of any class of such asset-backed securities is conditioned on the assignment
of a rating by one or more rating agencies. As a result of the repeal of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act and accordingly the imposition of a heightened liability standard that would result from such disclosures, MIS and other credit rating
agencies have declined to consent to issuers of such securities making such disclosures regarding their ratings. The staff of the SEC has informally advised issuers of asset-backed securities that, pending further review of rulemaking required under
the Financial Reform Act, the SEC staff will not recommend enforcement action if an issuer omits the ratings disclosure required by SEC rules for registered offerings of asset-backed securities. If the SEC staff position were reversed or if SEC
rules otherwise were adopted or applied in a manner that resulted in rating agencies being subject to heightened standards of liability in such offerings, it could adversely impact the volume of securities sold in such offerings, demand for
MIS’s ratings, the pricing structure for ratings issued by MIS and/or Moody’s exposure to liability and could have other effects that Moody’s is not able to predict, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business.

In addition, in October 2009, the SEC proposed a rule providing that, if credit ratings are used in connection with an offering
of any other type of security that is registered under the Securities Act (which as proposed would include use of a credit rating for certain unregistered securities offerings that are subsequently subject to a registered exchange offer), the
ratings must be included in the registration statement. If adopted, this proposal, coupled with the Financial Reform Act’s rescission of Rule 436(g), would mean that common practices used in the U.S. to market and sell securities in such
offerings would have to be altered unless MIS or other credit rating agencies consented to subject themselves to expert liability provisions of the Securities Act with respect to their credit ratings. Adoption of this or a similar rule could impact
the volume of securities sold in such offerings, demand for MIS’s ratings, the pricing structure for ratings issued by MIS and/or Moody’s exposure to liability and could have other effects that Moody’s is not able to predict, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Both the G-8 and the G-20 have sought to analyze and arrive at a consistent
approach for addressing the various areas of the financial market and have made a variety of recommendations as to regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings. Specifically, the G-20 has also agreed to require the registration of
rating agencies in their home jurisdiction. As a result of the internationally coordinated approach, countries other than the U.S. (which as noted above had already adopted a registration regime for NRSROs) have begun the process of implementing
registration regimes for the oversight of CRAs. In particular, the EU adopted a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the EU. The regulation seeks to introduce a common EU regulatory approach to the oversight of CRAs. Its primary
objective is to enhance the integrity, transparency, responsibility, governance and reliability of credit rating activities, by establishing conditions for the issuance of credit ratings and rules on the organization and conduct of credit rating
agencies, including restrictions on certain activities that are deemed to create a conflict of interest and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments. The regulation became fully effective on September 6, 2010. MIS
applied for registration in August 2010.

In addition, the European Securities and Market Authority has been formed which is expected to be fully
operational in June 2011 and will have direct supervisory authority for CRAs in the EU.

The European Commission has also published a consultation paper
that discusses:

•

the potential for increasing the liability or changing the basis of liability of CRAs for their ratings;

•

the issuer-pay CRA business model;

•

amending existing regulations to reduce reliance on ratings by governments and regulated industries;

•

proposed changes to the business model associated with the rating of sovereigns; and

•

increasing competition among CRAs;

The EU
Parliament is working on its own report discussing a number of these issues.

2010 10-K


The foregoing initiatives, if implemented and depending on their terms, could negatively impact Moody’s
operations or profitability, ability to compete or the markets for its products and services in ways that Moody’s presently is unable to predict. In particular, exposure to increased liability under future EU regulation may further increase
costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely affect Moody’s results of operations.

In addition
to the foregoing, in the wake of the credit crisis, legislative and regulatory bodies in both the U.S. and in other countries have adopted or are studying or pursuing new laws and regulations addressing CRAs and the use of credit ratings,
particularly in the area of structured finance securities, and the role of CRAs leading up to the credit crisis.

Moody’s believes that there is
still the potential for additional rulemaking that can significantly impact Moody’s business. It is likely that other jurisdictions will adopt additional laws or regulations affecting Moody’s operations or the markets for its products and
services. This could include adopting regulations that affect the need for debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings. However, Moody’s cannot predict the
extent of the regulations that may be implemented, or the effect that they may have on Moody’s operations or the potential for increased exposure to liability.

Exposure to Litigation Related to Moody’s Rating Opinions

Moody’s has received subpoenas and
inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities as part of ongoing investigations following the credit crisis, and is responding to those inquiries. In addition, Moody’s faces a greater amount of litigation than has
historically been the case from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions, as well as other related business practices. Due to the difficult economic times and turbulent markets over the last several years, the market value of
credit-dependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased, significantly increasing the number of legal proceedings, including investigations, Moody’s is currently facing. These proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company,
which may increase over time as these matters progress procedurally, require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues, and, given the number of these
proceedings, present a greater risk that Moody’s may be subject to fines or damages if Moody’s is deemed to have violated any laws or regulations. In jurisdictions outside the U.S., these types of proceedings may increase or become more
costly because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that currently exist in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as provided by the First Amendment) and may
pose a greater risk of criminal rather than civil penalties. These risks often are and may continue to be difficult to assess or quantify. Moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and their existence and
magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, to the extent that Moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals from the various litigation at an early stage and matters proceed to trial, the aggregate legal defense
costs to be incurred by Moody’s could increase substantially, regardless of the ultimate outcome.

In addition, as discussed above, the Financial
Reform Act revised pleading and liability standards and other provisions potentially subjecting CRAs to increased liability under securities law claims. The Financial Reform Act and regulations that will be adopted as a result of it may result in a
material increase in the number of legal proceedings, especially as related to future ratings, and, together with judicial decisions under the Financial Reform Act and under pre-existing legal standards, may increase the potential legal exposure of
CRAs. Changes in liability standards applicable in markets outside the U.S. also could create a greater potential for liability from operating in such markets. The Company believes that adoption of these provisions could negatively impact credit
markets, including causing CRAs to cease to issue ratings on certain securities or issuers, increasing the cost of ratings, delaying issuances of ratings and restricting the public availability of ratings, which changes could materially negatively
impact the Company’s business and prospects. It is possible that implementing changes to the Company’s operations to address the changed pleading and liability standards may result in lower revenues and/or increased expenses that the
Company may not be able to recoup or offset, which could be material, and the Company may not be successful in avoiding or mitigating the impact of the heightened or changed pleading and liability standards.

Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial
Markets

Approximately 57% of MIS’s revenue for 2010 was transaction-based, compared to 50% of MIS’s revenue in 2009 and 49% of
MIS’s revenue in 2008. Revenue from rating transactions is dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Accordingly, any conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce
issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar-equivalent volume of debt issuances for which MIS provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of
ratings.

A significant disruption in world financial markets, particularly in the credit markets, began in mid-2007, when many credit markets
experienced a severe lack of liquidity. This disruption continues to be felt as the markets gradually recover. Credit market disruptions together with an economic slowdown have negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global
capital markets and the demand for credit ratings. Notwithstanding a strong increase in debt issuances in the corporate, financial institutions and U.S. public finance sectors in 2010, future debt issuances could be negatively affected by a sharp
increase in long-term interest rates or factors which cause instability or volatility in the global capital markets. New debt issuances in the structured finance market are likely to con-

tinue to be significantly below peak levels reached in the middle of the past decade. Consequently, the Company has experienced a reduction in the overall demand for rating newly issued debt
securities. Changes in the markets for such securities and in the role and regulation of rating agencies may materially adversely affect the Company even if the volume of securities issuances in all sectors recovers to or exceeds those experienced
prior to 2007.

The timing, nature, extent and sustainability of any recovery in the credit and other financial markets remains uncertain, and there can
be no assurance that overall market conditions will improve in the future, that recent improvements will be sustained or that Moody’s financial results will not continue to be adversely affected. A sustained period of market decline or
weakness, especially if it relates to credit sensitive securities, for which there was historically a high level of demand for ratings, could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business and financial results. Initiatives that the Company
has undertaken to reduce costs may not be sufficient, and further cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the near term, due in part to rent, technology, compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the Company’s
operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings. Further, the cost-reduction initiatives undertaken to date could result in strains in the Company’s operations if the credit markets and demand for ratings in all sectors return to
levels that prevailed prior to mid-2007 or otherwise unexpectedly increase. Other factors that could further reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities include increases in
interest rates or credit spreads, continued volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant regulatory, political or economic events, the use of alternative sources of credit including financial institutions and
government sources, defaults of significant issuers and other unfavorable market and economic conditions.

Furthermore, issuers of debt securities may
elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by non-traditional parties such as financial advisors, rather than traditional credit rating agencies, such as MIS. Changing regulatory considerations and other
market developments could negatively affect the demand for credit ratings even if debt security issuances and activities increase. As such, no assurance can be given as to the amount of revenues that may be derived therefrom.

Legal, Economic and Regulatory Risks of Operating in Foreign Jurisdictions

Moody’s maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. In addition to the regulatory risks discussed above, operations in different countries
expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and currency fluctuations; U.S. laws affecting overseas operations including domestic and foreign
export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers; political and economic instability; the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions; longer payment cycles and possible
problems in collecting receivables; and potentially adverse tax consequences.

In its non-U.S. operations, Moody’s is subject to regulations
applicable under the Office of Foreign Asset Control, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing or
making improper payments to foreign government officials (which may include companies affiliated with foreign governments) for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe
criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. Internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance
programs that the Company has implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting its employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing its policies and the law. If Moody’s employees or agents fail to
comply with applicable laws or Company policies governing its international operations, the Company may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and
criminal sanctions. Any determination that the Company has violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to the Company’s
international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions.

In addition to competition from other rating agencies that
operate in a number of international jurisdictions and specialized companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company, Inc., with respect to the insurance industry), in many foreign
countries MIS competes with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence and greater familiarity or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive
support from local governments or other institutions that MIS does not receive, putting MIS at a competitive disadvantage.

Increased Pricing
Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers

In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and
market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service, as well as increased competition from non-NRSROs that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors. At the same time, bankruptcies and
consolidation of customers, particularly those involved in structured finance products, and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of customers. While Moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its
products and service, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moody’s may lose market share. In addition, one of the central goals of the Reform Act was to encourage competition
among rating agencies. The formation of additional NRSROs may increase pricing, as well as other competitive pressures.

Exposure to Reputational and Credibility Concerns

Moody’s reputation is one of the key bases on which the Company competes. To the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or Moody’s, relative to
its competitors, has suffered a loss in credibility in the course of the credit crisis, or, in the future, suffers a loss in credibility, Moody’s business could be adversely affected. Factors that may have already affected credibility and could
potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest, the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities by a particular rating agency, the timing and nature of changes
in ratings, adverse publicity as to the ratings process, a major compliance failure, publicity associated with ongoing litigation and new laws and regulations and increased criticism by users of ratings, regulators and legislative bodies. These
concerns may be disclosed or highlighted in the course of various investigations or lawsuits that have been or may be instituted, through legislative or regulatory hearings or special studies that are mandated by legislation, or through journalists
or others attempting to chronicle or report on the recent credit crisis.

Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies

The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are highly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products
and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing
credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moody’s, or may price or market their products in manners that differ
from those utilized by Moody’s. Customers or others may develop alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk. Such developments could affect demand for Moody’s products and its growth prospects. In addition, Moody’s
growth prospects also could be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved
by competitors.

Significant Amount of Intangible Assets

Moody’s has a significant amount of intangible assets on its balance sheet consisting of $465.5 million of goodwill and $168.8 million of amortizable intangible assets. Approximately 98% of these intangibles
reside in the MA business and are allocated to the four reporting units within MA: RD&A; RMS; Training, and CSI. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in one or all of these reporting units could result in an asset
impairment charge which would reduce net income in the period the impairment is recorded. Impairment of goodwill or intangibles would result in a non-cash charge to operating expenses. An impairment would be recorded if the fair value of a reporting
unit or asset group which holds goodwill or any intangible assets is less than the carrying amount of its net assets. A significant factor in the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group is its projected cash flows. Future
cash flows of MA are dependent on a variety of factors such as, but not limited to, general economic growth, capital market activity, product innovation, pricing, market share and competition. Changes in these factors or in the conduct of
Moody’s operations in response to such factors could lead to reduced cash flows resulting in an asset impairment charge.

Possible Loss of Key
Employees and Related Compensation Cost Pressures

Moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting, retaining and motivating highly skilled,
experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and
other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries. Investment banks, investors and competitors may seek to attract
analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering higher compensation than Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills
to perform sophisticated credit analysis.

The Trading Price of Moody’s Stock Could be Affected by Third Party Actions

Ownership of Moody’s stock is highly concentrated with a majority of shares held by a few institutional stockholders. Due to this concentrated stockholder
base, the trading price of Moody’s stock could be affected considerably by actions of significant stockholders to increase or decrease their positions in Moody’s stock.

Moody’s Operations and Infrastructure may Malfunction or Fail

Moody’s ability to conduct
business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which Moody’s is located, including having its headquarters in New York City and offices in major cities worldwide.
This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications or other services used by the Company or third parties with or through whom Moody’s conducts business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss,
telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism or war or otherwise. Moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of major operating systems may not be
successful. The Company does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of
Moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, their ability to service and

interact with Moody’s clients and customers may suffer. The Company’s operations also rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in
its computer systems and networks. The business relies upon and processes a great deal of data through its systems, the quality of which must be maintained in order for the business units to perform. Protective measures that Moody’s takes may
be circumvented or may not be sufficient to guard its computer systems, software and networks from unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this could
jeopardize Moody’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, its computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in the
Company’s, its clients’, its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations. Moody’s may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities
or other exposures, and the Company may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Moody’s.

PROPERTIES

Moody’s corporate headquarters is located
at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10007, with approximately 668,513 square feet of leased space. As of December 31, 2010, Moody’s operations were conducted from 15 U.S. offices and 43 non-U.S. office
locations, all of which are leased. These properties are geographically distributed to meet operating and sales requirements worldwide. These properties are generally considered to be both suitable and adequate to meet current operating
requirements.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, Moody’s is
involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in
the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings
pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

Following the events in the U.S. subprime residential mortgage
sector and the credit markets more broadly over the last several years, MIS and other credit rating agencies are the subject of intense scrutiny, increased regulation, ongoing investigation, and civil litigation. Legislative, regulatory and
enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation, regulation and enforcement actions, including with respect to MIS’s compliance with newly imposed regulatory standards. Moody’s has received subpoenas and
inquiries from states attorneys general and other governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries.

In addition, the
Company is facing litigation from market participants relating to the performance of MIS rated securities. Although Moody’s in the normal course experiences such litigation, the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly
increased in the current economic environment.

On June 27, 2008, the Brockton Contributory Retirement System, a purported shareholder of the
Company’s securities, filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York. The plaintiff asserts various causes of action relating to the named defendants’ oversight of MIS’s ratings of RMBS and constant-proportion debt obligations, and their participation in the alleged public dissemination of false
and misleading information about MIS’s ratings practices and/or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement of profits and other
equitable relief. On July 2, 2008, Thomas R. Flynn, a purported shareholder of the Company’s securities, filed a similar purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers,
and the Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, asserting similar claims and seeking the same relief. The cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in
November 2008. The Company removed the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in December 2008. In January 2009, the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, which the Company opposed. On February 23, 2010, the court issued an opinion remanding the case to the Supreme Court of New York. On October 30, 2008, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System, a purported
shareholder of the Company’s securities, also filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. This complaint also asserts various causes of action relating to the Company’s ratings of RMBS, CDO and constant-proportion debt obligations, and named defendants’ participation in the alleged

public dissemination of false and misleading information about MIS’s ratings practices and/or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. On
December 9, 2008, Rena Nadoff, a purported shareholder of the Company, filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and its CEO, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged overrating of asset-backed securities and underrating of municipal securities. On October 20, 2009, the Company moved to dismiss or stay
the action in favor of related federal litigation. On January 26, 2010, the court entered a stipulation and order, submitted jointly by the parties, staying the Nadoff litigation pending coordination and prosecution of similar claims in the
above and below described federal derivative actions. On July 6, 2009, W. A. Sokolowski, a purported shareholder of the Company, filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and current and
former officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts claims relating to alleged mismanagement of the Company’s processes for rating structured
finance transactions, alleged insider trading and causing the Company to buy back its own stock at artificially inflated prices.

Two purported class
action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the Company’s securities against the Company and certain of its senior officers, asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The first was filed by Raphael Nach in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 19, 2007. The second was filed by Teamsters Local 282 Pension Trust Fund in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 26, 2007. Both actions have
been consolidated into a single proceeding entitled In re Moody’s Corporation Securities Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 27, 2008, a consolidated amended complaint was filed, purportedly
on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities during the period February 3, 2006 through October 24, 2007. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false and/or misleading statements concerning the Company’s
business conduct, business prospects, business conditions and financial results relating primarily to MIS’s ratings of structured finance products including RMBS, CDO and constant-proportion debt obligations. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified
amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case. The Company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in September 2008. On February 23, 2009, the court issued an
opinion dismissing certain claims and sustaining others.

Moody’s Analytics is cooperating with an investigation by the SEC concerning services
provided by that unit to certain financial institutions in connection with the valuations used by those institutions with respect to certain financial instruments held by such institutions.

For claims, litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a
liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of
litigation, regulatory, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the
Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is
conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve the pending matters referred to above progresses, management will continue to review the latest information
available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, the large or indeterminate
damages sought in some of them and the novel theories of law asserted, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time. For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which
requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing
authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty
percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere
in this annual report on Form 10-K.

This MD&A contains Forward-Looking Statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” commencing on page 56
and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.

THE COMPANY

Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit
and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) risk management software and (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, credit portfolio management solutions, training and financial credentialing and certification services.
Moody’s operates in two reportable segments: MIS and MA.

MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt
obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors.

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets.
Within its RD&A business, MA distributes investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit related events.
The RD&A business also produces and provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores. Within its RMS business, MA provides both economic and regulatory capital risk management software
solutions. Within its professional services business it provides quantitative credit risk measures, credit portfolio management solutions, training and financial credentialing and certification services.

Beginning in January 2008, Moody’s segments were changed to reflect the Reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the Reorganization, the rating
agency is reported in the MIS segment and several ratings business lines were realigned. All of Moody’s other non-rating commercial activities are represented in the MA segment.

As part of the Reorganization there were several realignments within the MIS LOBs. Sovereign and sub-sovereign ratings, which were previously part of financial institutions; infrastructure/utilities ratings, which
were previously part of corporate finance; and project finance, which was previously part of structured finance, were combined with the public finance business to form a new LOB called public, project and infrastructure finance. In addition, real
estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business. Furthermore, in August 2008 the global managed investments ratings group, previously part of the structured finance
business, was combined with the financial institutions business.

In 2008 within MA, various aspects of the legacy MIS research business and MKMV
business were combined to form the subscriptions, software and professional services businesses. The subscriptions business included credit and economic research, data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis; the software
business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk, securities pricing and valuation software products; and the professional services business included advisory services associated with risk modeling, credit scorecard development, and
other specialized analytical projects, as well as credit training and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a per-engagement basis. Subscription services are typically sold for an initial 12-month term, with
renewal features for subsequent annual periods.

In 2009, the aforementioned MA businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit
structure for the MA segment. Pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed Research Data and Analytics and the software business was renamed Risk Management Software. The revised groupings classify certain subscription-based
risk management software revenue and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined RMS business. In November 2010, Moody’s purchased CSI, which is currently a reporting unit within MA and for which revenues are reported within
the professional services LOB.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The
preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis,


MOODY’S

2010 10-K


Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring liabilities,
pension and other post-retirement benefits, UTBs and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are
particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
or financial condition.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when
applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements” (“ASU 2009-13”). The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the
allocation of arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2009-13 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or
after January 1, 2010. If applied in the same manner to the year ended December 31, 2009, ASU 2009-13 would not have had a material impact on net revenue reported for both its MIS and MA segments in terms of the timing and pattern of
revenue recognition. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a significant effect on the Company’s net revenue in the period of adoption and is also not expected to have a significant effect on the Company’s net revenue in periods after
the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on the currently anticipated business volume and pricing.

For 2010 and future
periods, pursuant to the guidance of ASU 2009-13, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific
objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

The
Company’s products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under ASU 2009-13. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A
deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item, the delivery and performance of the undelivered
item is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. In instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.

The Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the VSOE criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable
when sold separately. In instances where the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a
reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history, the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or
services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in the Company’s market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and
services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company generally is unable to reliably determine
TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASU 2009-13, when the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the
product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products,
percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market
trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.

In the MIS segment, revenue
attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one
year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, derivatives, international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the
future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities, which ranged from two to 51 years at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $76
million, $78 million and $82 million, respectively.

Multiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial
rating and the related monitoring service. Beginning January 1, 2010, in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allo-

MOODY’S

cated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The Company generally uses ESP in determining the selling
price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings. Prior to January 1, 2010 and pursuant to the
previous accounting standards, for these types of arrangements the initial rating fee was first allocated to the monitoring service determined based on the estimated fair market value of monitoring services, with the residual amount allocated to the
initial rating. Under ASU 2009-13 this practice can no longer be used for non-software deliverables upon the adoption of ASU 2009-13.

MIS estimates
revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when
actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, accounts receivable included approximately $25 million, $27 million and $34 million,
respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings.

In the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from subscription based products, such as
research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit
processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from
services rendered within the professional services line of business is generally recognized as the services are performed. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance
occurs.

Products and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a
multiple element arrangement includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the
arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.

If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances
where the Company is not able to determine VSOE for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is
unable to determine VSOE for an undelivered element, the Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements.

Prior to January 1, 2010 and pursuant to the previous accounting standards, the Company allocated revenue in a multiple element arrangement to each deliverable
based on its relative fair value, or for software elements, based on VSOE. If the fair value was not available for an undelivered element, the revenue for the entire arrangement was deferred.

Accounts Receivable Allowance

Moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer
billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt
expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Billing adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and
assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the
need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly,
Moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However,
significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

Contingencies

Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the “Contingencies”
section of this “MD&A”, commencing on page 54 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third
parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their
potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where

deemed appropriate. The Company would record a material loss contingency in its financial statements if the loss is both probable of occurring and the loss can be reasonably estimated. The
Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.

Goodwill and
Other Acquired Intangible Assets

Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or
one level below an operating segment, annually as of November 30 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with ASC Topic 350. These impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce
the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a
significant portion of a reporting unit.

At November 30, 2010, the Company had five primary reporting units: one in MIS that encompasses all of
Moody’s ratings operations and four reporting units within MA: RD&A, RMS, training and CSI. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process,
in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The RMS reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software that is sold on a license or
subscription basis as well as related advisory services for implementation and maintenance. The training reporting unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training.
Additionally, in November 2010, the Company acquired CSI, which was tested separately as its own reporting unit for the annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30, 2010. CSI is Canada’s leading provider of financial learning,
credentials and certification.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit
level as required by ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other”. In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the
carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must perform a second
step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value
of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These
estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and appropriate market comparables. The Company bases
its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable. However, as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, actual future results may differ from these estimates. In addition, the Company also makes
certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.

Goodwill
is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units, and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Other assets and
liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.

Based
on the result of the above test, the Company does not believe any of its reporting units are at risk of failing Step 1 of the impairment test as the fair value for all reporting units is well in excess of the respective reporting unit’s
carrying value, except for CSI as the purchase price represents the fair value of the net assets acquired.

The following table identifies the amount of
goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of December 31, 2010 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350,
assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of November 30, 2010:

*CSI

was excluded from the sensitivity analysis in the table above as well as the sensitivity analyses on the WACC and future cash flow assumptions discussed below as it was acquired
in November 2010. Accordingly the carrying value of the net assets acquired approximates fair value at November 30, 2010.

MOODY’S

2010 10-K



The following discussion regarding the Company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting
units excludes the CSI which was acquired in November 2010:

The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology.
The results of the DCF are evaluated against comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples in order to assess the reasonableness of the DCF fair values. The DCF analysis requires significant judgments regarding the derivation of fair
value, including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects
of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce
the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the
acquisition. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions or realignments.

The following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment:

•

WACC

—The WACC is the rate to discount each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows. The WACC is calculated based on the proportionate
weighting of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity is based on a risk-free interest rate, an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties
associated with the reporting unit’s cash flows. The cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the Company’s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to
the computation of the WACC. The cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. The WACC for all reporting units ranged from 10%
to 12% in 2010. Differences in the WACC used between reporting units is due primarily to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. A sensitivity analysis of the WACC was performed on all reporting
units. An increase in the WACC of one percentage point for each of the reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test
as prescribed in ASC Topic 350.

•

Future cash flow assumptions

—The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions
regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. These projections are consistent with the Company’s operating and strategic plan. Cash flows for each of the next five years beginning in 2011 were estimated based on annual
revenue growth rates ranging from 4% to 14%. The growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue from financial service customers based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets which began in the second half of 2009.
Beyond five years a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real GDP growth rates. A sensitivity analysis of the growth rates was performed on all reporting units. A decrease in the growth rates used in
the discounted cash flow calculation of 10% for each of the reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as
prescribed in ASC Topic 350.

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no such events or changes during 2010 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the Company’s reporting units may not be
recoverable. This determination was made based on improving market conditions which has resulted in higher projected cash flows for all reporting units than was projected in 2009. Additionally, there were no events or circumstances during 2010 that
would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of the Company’s amortizable intangible assets.

Pension and Other
Post-Retirement Benefits

The expenses, assets and liabilities that Moody’s reports for its Post-Retirement Plans are dependent on many
assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following:

•

future compensation increases, based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook

•

long-term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within
the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments)

•

future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near-term outlooks and assessments of likely long-term trends

•

discount rates, based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds


MOODY’S

2010 10-K


The discount rates selected to measure the present value of the Company’s benefit obligation for its
Post-Retirement Plans as of December 31, 2010 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank pension discount
curve. The cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.

Moody’s major
assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the
Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s
Post-Retirement Plans.

When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. Excluding differences between the
expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets, the Company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan
participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. For Moody’s Post-Retirement Plans, the total losses as of
December 31, 2010 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $72.1 million, and Moody’s expects to recognize net periodic pension expense of $4.8 million in 2011 related to the amortization of actuarial losses.

For Moody’s funded U.S. pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net
periodic pension expense. As permitted under ASC Topic 715, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market-related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on
assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has an unrecognized asset loss of $11.8 million, of which $7.1 million will be
recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2012 expense.

The table
below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody’s 2011 operating income. These effects have been calculated using the Company’s current projections of 2011 expenses,
assets and liabilities related to Moody’s Post-Retirement Plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.

A one percentage-point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2011 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates
that expenses related to Post-Retirement Plans will be $23.0 million in 2011 compared with $20.2 million in 2010, excluding the effect of pension settlement charges. The expected expense increase in 2011 reflects the effects of higher benefit
obligations primarily due to lower discount rate assumptions and higher amortization of actuarial losses.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records compensation expense for all share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the
time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moody’s experience during
the period since becoming a public company. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense.

An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2010 (dollars in millions):

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts
charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax
expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that
are recognized for income tax purposes.

Moody’s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve Legacy Tax and other tax matters.
The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for UTPs. The Company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non-operating expenses.

For UTPs, ASC Topic 740 requires a company
to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine
the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized
upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of liabilities related to UTPs and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will
accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the Company’s operating results or financial condition.

For certain of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company has deemed a portion of the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations. Accordingly, the
Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. A future distribution or change in assertion regarding reinvestment by the foreign subsidiaries relating to these earnings could result in additional tax
liability for the Company. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the potential additional tax liability due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

Other Estimates

In addition, there are other accounting
estimates within Moody’s consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the
current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating
amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact Moody’s.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Beginning in
January 2008, Moody’s segments were changed to reflect the Reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the Reorganization, the rating agency is reported in the MIS segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All
of Moody’s other non-rating commercial activities are represented in the MA segment.

As part of the Reorganization there were several realignments
within the MIS LOBs. Sovereign and sub-sovereign ratings, which were previously part of financial institutions; infrastructure/utilities ratings, which were previously part of corporate finance; and project finance, which was previously part of
structured finance, were combined with the public finance business to form a new LOB called public, project and infrastructure finance. In addition, real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to
the structured finance business. Furthermore, in August 2008 the global managed investments ratings group, previously part of the structured finance business, was combined with the financial institutions business.

The MIS segment now consists of four lines of business—corporate finance, structured finance, financial institutions and public, project and infrastructure
finance—that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide.

As part of the Reorganization, various aspects of the legacy MIS research business and MKMV business were combined to form the subscriptions, software and
professional services businesses within MA. The subscriptions business included credit and economic research, data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis for an initial 12-month term, with renewal features for subsequent annual
periods; the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk, securities pricing and valuation


MOODY’S

2010 10-K


software products; and the professional services business included credit training associated with risk modeling, credit scorecard development, and other specialized analytical projects, as well
as credit and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a per-engagement basis.

In 2009, the aforementioned MA
businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the MA segment at December 31, 2009. Pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed Research, Data and Analytics and the software business
was renamed Risk Management Software. The revised groupings classify license software sales, certain subscription-based risk management software revenue, maintenance and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined RMS business. The
following tables are reconciliations of the revenue groupings previously disclosed to the new groupings for the year ended December 31, 2008:

Additionally, in November 2010, a subsidiary of the Company acquired CSI, which is Canada’s leading provider of financial
learning, credentials and certification. CSI is part of the MA segment and its revenue is included in the professional services LOB within MA.

The
following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments, including the intersegment royalty revenue for MIS and expense charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. Additionally,
overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company are allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human
resource, information technology and legal.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year
Ended December 31, 2010 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009

Executive Summary

Moody’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $2,032.0 million, an increase of $234.8 million compared to the same period in 2009. Total
expenses were $1,259.2 million, an increase of $149.5 million compared to 2009. Operating income of $772.8 million in 2010 increased $85.3 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the restructuring charge in 2009 and minor
restructuring-related adjustments in both years, operating income increased $67.9 million from $705.0 million in the prior year period. Diluted EPS of $2.15 for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $0.46, or 27% over the prior year period
and included a benefit of $0.02 associated with the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter as well as other tax benefits of $0.15 in 2010 relating to foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, foreign tax credits and lower state taxes. Excluding
the aforementioned Legacy Tax Matter in

MOODY’S

2010 10-K



2010, diluted EPS of $2.13 increased $0.43, or 25%, from $1.70 in 2009, which excludes a prior year favorable impact of $0.04 related to the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter and an unfavorable
$0.05 impact for restructuring.

Moody’s Corporation

The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary:

The table below shows Moody’s global staffing by
geographic area:

Global revenue of $2,032.0 million in 2010 increased $234.8 million compared to the same period in 2009, reflecting good
growth in both ratings and MA revenue. The growth in ratings revenue is primarily due to strong issuance activity in 2010 within the corporate finance, financial institution and public finance debt markets. The growth in MA is due to higher revenue
across all LOBs. Transaction revenue accounted for 44% of global MCO revenue in 2010 compared to 37% in the same period of the prior year. Transaction revenue in the MIS segment represents the initial rating of a new debt issuance as well as other
one-time fees while relationship revenue represents the recurring monitoring of a rated debt obligation and/or entities that issue such obligations, as well as revenue from programs such as commercial paper, medium-term notes and shelf
registrations. In the MA segment, relationship revenue represents subscription-based revenues and software maintenance revenue. Transaction revenue in MA represents software license fees and revenue from the professional services line of business
which offers credit risk management advisory and training services, which are typically sold on a per-engagement basis.

U.S. revenue increased $168.7
million over 2009 reflecting growth in all ratings LOBs, most notably in rated issuance volumes for bank loans and speculative-grade corporate bonds. There was also good growth over the prior year in U.S. public finance and CREF rated issuance.
Additionally, there was growth in all LOBs within the MA segment, most notably in RMS.

International revenue increased $66.1 million compared to the
same period in 2009 primarily reflecting growth in CFG revenue, particularly in speculative-grade ratings in EMEA, coupled with higher banking related revenue across all regions. Additionally, the growth


MOODY’S

2010 10-K


reflects higher revenue across all MA LOBs, primarily from within the Asia and the Americas regions. These increases were partially offset by declines in most asset classes within SFG as well as
declines in investment-grade rated issuance within the EMEA region.

Operating expenses were $604.8 million in 2010, an increase of $72.4 million from
the same period in 2009 and were primarily due to both higher compensation and non-compensation costs. Compensation costs increased approximately $63 million reflecting approximately $30 million higher incentive compensation primarily resulting from
greater achievement against targeted results compared to achievement against targeted results in the prior year period, a $7 million global profit sharing contribution due to the Company’s growth in diluted EPS over 2009 and approximately $29
million higher salaries and related employee benefits primarily due to annual merit increases coupled with higher headcount in both operating segments to support business growth. Non-compensation costs increased approximately $9 million reflecting
higher professional service costs for ongoing investments in technology infrastructure as well as higher travel-related costs which reflects improving business conditions compared to 2009.

SG&A expenses of $588.0 million in 2010 increased $92.3 million from the same period in 2009. Non-compensation expenses increased approximately $47 million over the prior year primarily reflecting higher
professional service costs relating to ongoing investments in technology infrastructure as well as higher legal and litigation-related costs related to ongoing matters. Compensation costs increased approximately $45 million primarily due to higher
salaries and related employee benefits which reflects annual merit increases and headcount growth in sales personnel within MA as well as in support areas such as compliance and IT. Additionally there was approximately $10 million higher incentive
compensation costs compared to 2009 which primarily reflects greater achievement against targeted results compared to the achievement of targeted results in the prior year period. Furthermore, there was an approximate $6 million profit sharing
contribution in 2010 due to the Company’s year-over-year growth in diluted EPS.

Restructuring expense in 2009 reflects severance costs associated
with the 2009 Restructuring Plan approved on March 27, 2009 and adjustments to the previous estimates for both the 2007 and 2009 Restructuring Plans.

Operating income of $772.8 million, was up $85.3 million from the same period in 2009, reflecting the 13% increase in revenue being partially offset by the $149.5 million increase in expenses. Excluding the
restructuring charge in 2009 and minor restructuring-related adjustments in both periods, operating income increased $67.9 million over 2009.

Interest
(expense) income, net for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $(52.5) million, a $19.1 million increase in expense compared to the same period in 2009. The increase relates primarily to an interest expense reduction of approximately $12
million in the first quarter of 2009 for UTBs and other tax-related liabilities that did not recur in 2010. Also, there was an approximate $7 million increase in interest expense on borrowings which primarily reflects interest on the 2010 Senior
Notes issued in the third quarter of 2010. Additionally, there was interest income related to the favorable settlement of Legacy Tax Matters of $2.5 million and $6.5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Other non-operating (expense) income, net of $(5.9) million in 2010 decreased $2.0 million compared to the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects FX losses
of approximately $(5) million in 2010 compared to losses of approximately $(10) million in 2009. The FX losses in both periods primarily reflect the weakening of the euro to the British pound over both of the twelve month periods ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Moody’s ETR was 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010, down from 37.0% in 2009 and was primarily due to
increased taxable income internationally; indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign earnings; utilization of foreign tax credits; lower state taxes; and a resolution of a non-U.S. tax audit resulting in a reduction of UTBs. Additionally, the 2009
ETR reflects a non-taxable $12 million interest expense reduction related to UTBs and other tax-related liabilities. The 2010 and 2009 tax expense included benefits of $2.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively, relating to the favorable resolution
of Legacy Tax Matters (see “Contingencies – Legacy Tax Matters” below for further information). Excluding the Legacy Tax Matters in both years, the ETR in 2010 of 28.5% decreased 910 Bps from 2009.

Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $507.8 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, and increased $105.8 million, or $0.46 per diluted share,
compared to the prior year. Included in the 2010 Net Income were tax benefits of approximately $36 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, relating to the indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign earnings, utilization of foreign tax credits and lower
state taxes. Excluding benefits for favorable resolutions of Legacy Tax Matters in both 2010 and 2009, as well as the restructuring charge in 2009 and related adjustments in both years, Net Income increased $98.6 million, or 24%, to $503.3 million,
resulting in a $0.43, or 25%, increase in diluted EPS compared to the prior year.

The table below provides a summary of revenue and
operating results, followed by further insight and commentary:

The following is a discussion of external MIS revenue as well as operating expenses:

Global MIS revenue of $1,405.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $187.3 million compared to the same period in 2009. The increase
reflects strong growth in rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans within CFG as well as good growth from public finance and banking related issuance within PPIF and FIG, respectively. These increases were partially offset
by declines in derivatives and investment-grade corporate debt rated issuance volumes within SFG and CFG, respectively. Transaction revenue for MIS in 2010 was 57% of total revenue compared to 50% in 2009, with the increase primarily reflecting the
aforementioned strong rated issuance in the high-yield corporate debt and bank loan sectors within CFG.

In the U.S., revenue was $815.4 million in
2010, an increase of $152.3 million, or 23%, compared to the same period in 2009. The increase relates primarily to strong rated issuance volumes in bank loans and high-yield corporate debt within CFG, higher rated issuance in the CREF sector within
SFG and good growth in PPIF. These increases were partially offset by declines in derivatives and consumer asset-backed securities rated issuance within SFG.

Non-U.S. revenue was $589.6 million in 2010, an increase of $35.0 million, or 6%, over the prior year. The increase reflects growth in banking related revenue across all non-U.S. regions as well as higher
speculative-grade corporate debt issuance in the EMEA region. Additionally, there was higher revenue in 2010 for Indicative Ratings and Corporate Family Ratings in the EMEA region. These increases were partially offset by declines within the EMEA
region in most asset classes within SFG coupled with lower rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt.

Global CFG revenue of $563.9
million in 2010 increased $155.7 million from the prior year primarily due to higher rated issuance volumes in the high-yield corporate debt and bank loan sectors, coupled with an increase in Indicative Ratings and Corporate Family Ratings. The
aforementioned growth was partially offset by declines in rated issuance for investment-grade corporate debt which reflects a strong prior year comparative period where many companies were refinancing their debt ahead of expected maturities.
Transaction revenue represented 73% of total CFG revenue in 2010, compared to 64% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue in 2010 was $369.5 million, or 47% higher than the same period in 2009. This increase is primarily due to higher bank loan
issuance reflecting the narrowing of credit spreads and the low interest rate environment in 2010 which has resulted in a high volume of refinancing activity coupled with increased issuance related to leveraged buy-out activity. Additionally, there
was higher speculative-grade corporate debt issuance reflecting increased investor appetite for high-yield instruments as stability has gradually returned to the corporate credit markets. Internationally, revenue of $194.4 million in 2010 increased
24% compared to the same period in 2009, driven primarily by growth in rated issuance volumes for speculative-grade corporate debt across all regions which reflects the aforementioned increased

investor confidence in the high-yield markets coupled with higher revenue from Indicative Ratings and Corporate Family Ratings in the EMEA region. These increases were partially offset by
declines in investment-grade rated issuance in EMEA reflecting a strong comparative prior year period where many companies were refinancing their debt ahead of expected maturities.

Global SFG revenue of $290.8 million in 2010 decreased $14.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 reflecting lower revenue in the derivatives and consumer asset-backed securities asset classes partially
offset by increased rated issuance activity in U.S. CREF. Transaction revenue represented 43% of total SFG revenue in 2010 compared to 41% in the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue of $142.9 million in 2010 increased $0.8 million compared to
the prior year reflecting growth in both commercial mortgage-backed securities and real estate investment trusts rated issuance resulting from the low interest rate environment and narrowing credit spreads in these sectors. The aforementioned growth
was almost completely offset by continued declines in the derivatives sector as well as declines in consumer asset-backed securities issuance reflecting continued lack of investor demand as well as regulatory uncertainties pertaining to these asset
classes. Non-U.S. revenue of $147.9 million in 2010 decreased $14.9 million compared to the prior year, reflecting declines in most asset classes within the EMEA region as uncertainties surrounding the EU sovereign debt markets at various times
throughout 2010 has reduced investor demand for structured products.

Global FIG revenue of $278.7 million in 2010 increased $20.2 million from the
prior year, primarily reflecting higher banking related revenue. Transaction revenue increased to 37% of global FIG revenue, up from 31% in the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue of $114.4 million in 2010 increased $7.1 million compared to the
prior year. The growth over the prior year was driven by higher insurance related rated issuance which reflected insurers taking advantage of the low interest rate environment in 2010 to refinance debt ahead of expected maturities as well as
issuance to fund acquisition activity. Outside the U.S., revenue in 2010 was $164.3 million, or 9% higher than in the prior year, and was primarily due to growth in banking revenue across all non-U.S. regions, most notably in the Asia and Americas
regions, compared to a challenging prior year period.

Global PPIF revenue was $271.6 million in 2010, an increase of $25.5 million compared to the same
period in 2009, primarily reflecting increases in public and project finance revenue. Revenue generated from new transactions was 59% of total PPIF revenue in 2010, unchanged from the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2010 of $188.6 million increased 16% over the prior year primarily due to growth in public finance revenue which reflects modest price increases compared to the prior year coupled with issuance relating to the Build America Bond
Program which was implemented in the U.S. as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Additionally, there was higher project and infrastructure finance revenue as issuers took advantage of the low interest rate environment and the
Build America Bond Program to fund capital expenditure needs. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue decreased 1% compared to prior year reflecting declines in infrastructure and project finance revenue within the EMEA region due to uncertainties in the EU
debt markets at various times during 2010 coupled with a strong comparative prior year period. These decreases were offset by higher project finance rated issuance in the Asia and Americas regions.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2010 increased $102.9 million compared to the prior year and reflected increases in compensation and non-compensation expenses
of approximately $63 million and $40 million, respectively. The increase in compensation expenses relates to higher salaries reflecting annual merit increases, modest headcount growth within the ratings LOBs as well as support areas such as
compliance and IT for which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. Additionally, there was higher incentive compensation due to greater achievement against targeted results in 2010 compared to the achievement
against targeted results in the prior year. Furthermore, there was a profit sharing contribution in 2010 reflecting the Company’s diluted EPS growth over 2009. The increase in non-compensation expenses primarily reflects higher legal and
litigation- related costs relating to ongoing matters and higher IT consulting costs relating to investments in technology infrastructure.

The
restructuring charge of $9.1 million in the prior year period reflects costs associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan approved in the first quarter of 2009 as well as minor adjustments made to both the 2009 and 2007 restructuring plans.

Operating income in 2010 of $649.4 million, which includes the intersegment royalty revenue, increased $92.2 million from the prior year and reflects
the 15% increase in total MIS revenue exceeding the 13% increase in operating expenses. Excluding the restructuring-related amounts in both periods, operating income in 2010 was $649.5 million, an increase of $83.2 million from the same period in
2009.

The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary:

Global MA revenue in 2010 increased $47.5 million over the prior year primarily reflecting growth in all three LOBs.
Recurring revenue, which includes subscriptions and software maintenance fees, comprised 85% of MA revenue in 2010, down from 89% in the same period of 2009.

Revenue in the U.S. increased $16.4 million, or 6%, over the prior year and reflected growth across all LOBs, most notably in RMS. International revenue, which represented 56% of total MA revenue in both 2010 and
2009, increased 10% over the prior year reflecting growth in all LOBs.

Global RD&A revenue, which comprised over 67% of total MA revenue in both
2010 and 2009, increased $11.4 million, or 3%, over the prior year. The increase reflects greater demand for products that support analysis for investment and commercial credit applications and also the gradual stabilization among capital markets
customers as disruption from the global financial crisis recedes. Global RMS revenue in 2010 increased $28.1 million over the prior year primarily due to the final delivery and client acceptance of software licenses and implementations, primarily
from within the U.S and Asia regions. Revenue from professional services increased $8.0 million compared to 2009, with approximately 40% of the growth related to the acquisition of CSI in the fourth quarter of 2010. Revenue in the RMS and
professional services LOBs are subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of revenue in a relatively small number of engagements.

Operating and SG&A expenses in 2010, which include the intersegment royalty for the right to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS,
increased $63.1 million compared to 2009 reflecting both higher compensation and non-compensation costs of approximately $46 million and $16 million, respectively. The increase in compensation costs is primarily due to higher incentive compensation
reflecting greater achievement against targeted results in 2010 compared to achievement against targeted results in the prior year coupled with a profit sharing contribution in 2010 reflecting the Company’s diluted EPS growth over 2009.
Additionally, there were higher salaries reflecting annual merit increases and headcount increases to support business growth coupled with an increase in commission expense compared to the prior year reflecting higher MA sales. The increase in
non-compensation costs reflects higher legal and litigation- related costs relating to ongoing matters that Moody’s Corporation is exposed to, which are allocated to MA as part of the allocation of overhead and corporate expenses which is based
on a revenue-split methodology. Additionally, the increase in non-compensation expenses reflects higher travel and entertainment costs due to improving business conditions over the prior year.

The restructuring charge of $8.4 million in the prior year period reflects severance costs associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan approved in the first
quarter of 2009, which includes costs related to the divestiture of non-strategic assets and contract termination costs for office closures as well as minor adjustments made to original estimates for the 2007 Restructuring Plan.

Operating income of $123.4 million in 2010, which includes the intersegment royalty expense, decreased $6.9 million compared to the prior year, reflecting the
$54.4 million increase in total expenses exceeding the $47.5 million increase in revenue. Excluding the 2009 restructuring charge and minor restructuring-related adjustments for both restructuring plans in 2009, operating income decreased $15.3
million from the same period in 2009.

The table below shows Moody’s global staffing by
geographic area:

Global revenue of $1,797.2 million in 2009 increased $41.8 million compared to 2008 with modest growth in both MIS and
MA. The MIS growth is reflective of gradual improvement in the credit markets throughout 2009 which resulted in increased issuance volumes for fundamental ratings, particularly for investment-grade and high-yield corporate debt, partially offset by
continued declines in structured finance issuance. The MA growth is primarily due to higher international RMS revenue which resulted from the Fermat acquisition made in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the negative impact from changes in FX
translation rates, Moody’s revenue in 2009 increased $76.6 million compared to 2008. Transaction revenue accounted for 37% of global MCO revenue in 2009 compared to 36% in the prior year.

In the U.S., revenue increased $10.7 million with modest growth in MIS being partially offset by declines in MA. The
increase in ratings revenue primarily reflects the aforementioned recovery in the investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond markets partially offset by declines in structured finance ratings. Revenue declined for all LOBs within MA.

International revenue of $876.4 million for 2009 was $31.1 million higher than 2008 and reflected growth in investment-grade and high-yield rated issuance within
CFG as well as MA revenue which benefited from acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008.

These increases were partially offset by significant
declines in SFG revenue within MIS as well as approximately $35 million in unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates.

Total expenses for
2009 were $1,109.7 million, an increase of $102.5 million from 2008. The increase primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008, costs associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan and higher incentive compensation
reflecting greater achievement against 2009 targeted results. Additionally, there were higher rent and occupancy costs in 2009 related to the Canary Wharf lease in London, higher professional services costs which include legal and IT consulting as
well as a charge for an international VAT matter. The aforementioned increases were partially offset by an approximate $32 million favorable impact from changes in FX translation rates.

Operating expenses were $532.4 million, an increase of $39.1 million from the prior year, resulting primarily from higher compensation costs of approximately $28 million compared to the same period in 2008.
Compensation costs were $445.1 million, an increase of 7% from prior year, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation costs due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results compared to achievement against targeted results in the
prior year. Non-compensation expenses in 2009 were $87.3 million, an increase of approximately $11 million compared to the same period in 2008. The increase is due to higher professional service costs which include technology consulting costs
associated with an investment in IT infrastructure. The increase in both compensation and non-compensation expenses were partially offset by favorable changes in FX translation rates.

SG&A expenses of $495.7 million were $54.4 million higher than prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher non-compensation costs, which reflect higher rent expense relating to the Canary Wharf lease in
London, additional bad debt expense due to the deterioration of liquidity caused by general economic conditions, higher professional services costs which include consulting as well as higher costs associated with investment in technology
infrastructure. Compensation costs of $250.1 million increased 7% over the same period in 2008 primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation costs due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results compared to achievement against targeted
results in the prior year.

Restructuring expenses of $17.5 million in 2009 reflect costs associated with headcount reductions, the divestiture of
non-strategic assets and contract terminations in accordance with the 2009 Restructuring Plan, as well as adjustments to previous estimates for the 2007 Restructuring Plan. The restructuring benefit of $2.5 million in 2008 reflects adjustments to
previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the 2007 Restructuring Plan.

Depreciation and amortization of $64.1
million decreased $11.0 million from 2008 primarily due to the following items in 2008: an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets within the MA segment, a $4.5 million write-off of acquired in-process
technology related to the acquisition of Fermat and approximately $4 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Company’s New Jersey office. The absence of these items in 2009 was partially offset by higher amortization
of intangible assets in 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Operating income of $687.5 million decreased
$60.7 million from prior year reflecting the 10% increase in operating expenses being partially offset by modest revenue increases. Excluding the impact of restructuring in both years, operating income of $705.0 million decreased $40.7 million.
Changes in FX translation rates had a $3 million unfavorable impact on operating income in 2009.

Interest (expense) income, net for the year ended
December 31, 2009 was ($33.4) million, a decrease of $18.8 million compared to the same period in 2008. The change is due primarily to an interest expense reduction of approximately $12 million for tax and tax-related liabilities recorded in
the first quarter of 2009 coupled with a $6.5 million favorable resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter in the second quarter of 2009. Interest expense on borrowings decreased approximately $15 million compared to 2008 reflecting lower short-term debt
balances coupled with lower interest rates on borrowings under the 2007 Facility and CP Program. During 2009, the Company has utilized its operating cash flow to reduce short-term borrowings by 38%. Additionally, interest income decreased
approximately $16 million compared to the same period in 2008 reflecting lower interest rate yields on cash and cash equivalents balances.

Other
non-operating income (expense), net in 2009 was $(7.9) million compared to $33.8 million in 2008. The change reflects FX losses of $9.5 million in 2009 compared to FX gains of $24.7 million in 2008 primarily reflecting the weakening of the euro to
the British pound in 2009 as well as $11 million in favorable adjustments for Legacy Tax Matters in 2008.

Moody’s Investors Service

The table below provides a summary of revenue and
operating results, followed by further analysis and commentary:

The following is a discussion of external MIS revenue as well as operating expenses:

Global MIS revenue in 2009 of $1,217.7 million increased $13.0 million, or $35.9 million excluding unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, compared to 2008.
The increase from prior year reflects growth in rated issuance in the investment-grade and high-yield sectors of CFG coupled with increases in public and infrastructure ratings revenue within PPIF. These increases were partially offset by declines
in new issuance in SFG and FIG. Transaction revenue for total MIS in 2009 was 50% compared to 49% in 2008.

In the U.S., revenue was $663.1 million, an
increase of $18.1 million or 3% from prior year reflecting strong growth in ratings of investment and speculative-grade corporate debt partially offset by new issuance declines which were significant in SFG and modest in FIG. Non-U.S. revenue was
$554.6 million and decreased 1% from the same period in 2008. The decrease primarily reflects declines in all international regions within SFG partially offset by growth in CFG and PPIF in EMEA due to higher issuance volumes.

Global CFG revenue of $408.2 million increased $101.2 million from the prior year which included approximately $6 million of unfavorable impact from changes in FX
translation rates. The global increase is due primarily to higher rated issuance volume in the investment-grade and high-yield sectors. Transaction revenue represented 64% of total CFG revenue, an increase from 54% in the prior year. In the U.S.,
revenue was $251.2 million, an increase of $68.1 million compared to 2008, reflecting strong growth in both investment-grade and high-yield bond issuance. U.S. revenue accounted for 62% of global CFG compared to 60% in the prior year period. The
growth in investment-grade rated issuance reflects an increase in the number of companies refinancing debt ahead of expected maturities to take advantage of favorable interest rates within the corporate finance markets and to improve liquidity. The
activity in the U.S. high-yield markets increased revenue by approximately $45 million, with 68% of the growth occurring in the second half of 2009. The growth in speculative-grade rated issuance reflects increased investor confidence in the
high-yield market and the continued narrowing of interest rate spreads compared to U.S. Treasuries which began in the second quarter of 2009. Internationally, revenue of $157.0 million in 2009 increased 27% compared to the same period in 2008,
driven primarily by growth in investment-grade issuance within EMEA and high-yield issuance across all non-U.S. regions, reflecting early debt refinancing activities.

2010 10-K



Global SFG revenue of $304.9 million decreased $99.8 million reflecting the continued slowdown of new issuance in the
securitization markets due to reduced investor appetite, continued high interest rate spreads and higher credit enhancements. The continued decline in new issuance resulted in transaction revenue in 2009 representing 41% of total SFG revenue,
compared to 50% in 2008. In the U.S., revenue of $142.1 million decreased $42.1 million with the most prevalent declines in the Derivatives, ABS and CMBS sectors. Non-U.S. revenue was $162.8 million and declined $57.7 million from 2008, with 41% of
the decrease occurring within EMEA Derivatives. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates had a $7 million impact on international SFG revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Global FIG revenue of $258.5 million declined $4.5 million from the prior year, with declines in the U.S. being partially offset by modest growth internationally. Transaction revenue declined to 31% of total FIG
revenue, compared to 33% in the same period of 2008. In the U.S., 2009 revenue of $107.3 million decreased $10.5 million from 2008, primarily within specialty insurance which reflects continued contraction within the sector. Outside the U.S.,
revenue was $151.2 million, an increase of 4% from the prior year due primarily to growth in the banking sector in the Canada and Latin America regions. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates negatively impacted international FIG revenue by
approximately $6 million.

Global PPIF revenue was $246.1 million and increased $16.1 million compared to the same period in 2008 with increases in
public finance and infrastructure finance being partially offset by declines in U.S. municipal structured products. Revenue generated from new transactions comprised 59% of global PPIF, unchanged from the same period of 2008. In the U.S., PPIF
revenue increased $2.6 million compared to 2008 with growth in public finance reflecting higher issuance related to the Build America Bond Program which was implemented in the U.S. as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,
coupled with higher project and infrastructure revenue. These increases were partially offset by declines in issuance for municipal structured products which reflects declines in bank capacity and a lower market penetration for insured transactions.
Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue increased $13.5 million, or 19% over 2008, reflecting growth in infrastructure finance and public finance revenue in EMEA partially offset by declines in project finance in Asia. Excluding the $4 million unfavorable
impact of changes in FX translation rates, international revenue grew $17.7 million compared to the same period in 2008.

Operating and SG&A
expenses in 2009 increased $44.1 million, reflecting increases in compensation and non-compensation costs of approximately $26 million and $18 million, respectively. The increase in compensation costs compared to 2008 related to higher incentive
compensation due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results being partially offset by cost savings realized from the 2007 and 2009 Restructuring Plans, $6 million of senior executive severance costs included in 2008 and the impact of
favorable changes in FX translation rates. The increase in non-compensation costs reflects higher rent and occupancy costs for the Canary Wharf Lease, higher professional services costs which include legal and IT consulting and a higher allowance
for uncollectible accounts due to the deterioration of liquidity caused by general economic conditions. Additionally, there was a charge in 2009 for an international VAT matter.

Restructuring expenses reflect costs associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan as well as adjustments made to previous estimates for the 2007 Restructuring Plan.

Depreciation and amortization of $31.3 million decreased $2.0 million from the prior year and was primarily due to the 2008 accelerated depreciation for the New
Jersey office facility closure being partially offset by higher depreciation relating to costs capitalized for ongoing IT systems projects which were placed in service during 2009.

Operating income of $557.2 million was $43.4 million lower than 2008 primarily reflecting the 8% increase in total expenses. Changes in FX translation rates had an immaterial impact on operating income during in
2009.

The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary:

Global MA revenue increased $28.8 million, with all of the growth generated internationally, and included a negative $12
million impact from changes in FX translation. Recurring revenue comprised 89% of total revenue in 2009, slightly lower than the 91% in 2008 reflecting higher RMS license and service revenue which is primarily transaction-based.

In the U.S., revenue of $257.7 million decreased 3%, reflecting declines across all LOB’s. International revenue of $321.8 million was $36.2 million higher
than in 2008, primarily reflecting strong growth in RMS resulting from the Fermat acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Global RD&A revenue,
which comprises 71% of total MA in 2009, was down slightly compared to 2008 reflecting modestly higher attrition due to contraction among capital markets customers offset by demand for products that support analysis for investment and commercial
credit applications. U.S. revenue was $212.5 million, a decrease of $3.7 million from 2008. Internationally, revenue totaled $201.1 million, a decrease of $1.4 million from the prior year.

Global RMS revenue increased $36.3 million compared to 2008, and was primarily due to the Fermat acquisition made in the fourth quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue of $42.1 million was down $1.7 million compared prior
year, while international revenue of $103.0 million increased $38.0 million reflecting the aforementioned acquisition made in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Global professional services revenue decreased $2.4 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting declines in training services in the U.S. and EMEA as
companies reduced their spending on these services due to the poor capital markets and economic conditions during 2009.

Operating and SG&A expenses
of $408.0 million increased $45.8 million from the prior year, reflecting higher compensation and non-compensation costs. Compensation costs of $229.1 million increased $18.2 million from the prior year and reflected additional headcount from
acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008 partially offset by lower incentive compensation resulting from lower achievement against 2009 targeted results compared to achievement against targeted results in the prior year. Non-compensation
expenses were $118.9 million, an increase of $31.2 million compared to 2008, primarily due to higher rent and occupancy costs for the Canary Wharf Lease and higher expenses related to acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. The
aforementioned increases for both compensation and non-compensation costs were partially offset by favorable changes in FX translation rates.

Restructuring expenses of $8.4 million reflect severance and contract termination costs associated with the divestiture of non-strategic assets as well as
adjustments made to previous estimates for the 2009 and 2007 Restructuring Plans.

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $9.0 million from
prior year, primarily due to adjustments recorded in 2008 relating to an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets and a $4.5 million write-off of acquired in-process technology related to the acquisition
of Fermat. The absence of these items in 2009 was partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets during 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Operating income of $130.3 million decreased $17.3 million compared to 2008, due to the 11% increase in expenses
outpacing the 5% increase in revenue. Excluding restructuring in both years, operating income in 2009 was $138.7 million, a decrease of $8.0 million from the same period in 2008.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

In addition to its reported results, Moody’s has included in this
MD&A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as “non-GAAP financial measures.” Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s reported results, can provide useful
supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the Company’s performance. These non-GAAP financial measures relate to expenses and adjustments made to both the Company’s 2007 and 2009 Restructuring Plans
and Legacy Tax Matters, further described in Note 10 and Note 17, respectively, to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The table below shows Moody’s consolidated results for each of the years ended December 31,
2010, 2009 and 2008, adjusted to exclude the impact of the aforementioned items:

(a)

To exclude amounts related to the 2009 restructuring charge as well as minor adjustments related to both the 2009 and 2007 restructuring charges.

Additionally, includes the tax impacts of the aforementioned adjustments.

(b)

To exclude benefits and related tax resulting from the resolution of certain legacy tax matters.

MARKET RISK

Foreign exchange risk:

Moody’s maintains operations in 25 countries outside the U.S. In 2010, approximately 45% and 46% of the Company’s revenue and expenses, respectively, were
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally in the GBP and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 46% of Moody’s assets were located outside

the United States. making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in FX rates. The effects of translating assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with non-U.S. functional currencies to the
U.S. dollar are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment account in the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity (deficit).

The effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are charged to other income/expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations. Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency. If all foreign
currencies in the Company’s foreign exchange forward portfolio were to devalue 10% compared to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $10 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts. This unfavorable
change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by favorable FX revaluation gains in future earnings on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional
currency. Additional information on the Company’s forward contracts can be found in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10K.

Credit and Interest rate risk:

The Company’s interest rate risk management objective is to reduce the
funding cost and volatility to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. Moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing this objective.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its floating rate $150 million 2008 Term Loan entered into on May 7, 2008. The Company
entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150 million to protect against fluctuations in the LIBOR-based variable interest rate. These swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of
each reporting period and fluctuations related to unrealized gains and losses are recorded into AOCI, while net interest payments are recorded in interest expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations. A hypothetical change of
100bps in the LIBOR would result in an approximate $3 million change to the fair value of these interest rate swaps which would be recognized over the swaps remaining contractual term. Additional information on this interest rate swap is
disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10K.

Additionally, the Company is exposed to interest
rate risk on its various outstanding fixed rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates. The Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million
in the fourth quarter of 2010 to convert the fixed rate of interest on its $300 million Series 2005-1 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the 3 month LIBOR. These swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates
at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the Series 2005-1 Notes, while net interest payments are recorded as interest expense/income in the Company’s consolidated
statement of operations. A hypothetical change of 100bps in the LIBOR would result in an approximate $14 million change to the fair value of these interest rate swaps. Additional information on this interest rate swap is disclosed in Note
5 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10K.

Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $659.6 million
at December 31, 2010 consisted of approximately $438 million located outside the U.S. Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high-quality investment-grade securities within and outside the U.S. with maturities of three months
or less when purchased. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high-grade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single
issuer. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and high quality investment-grade corporate bonds in Korea.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flow

The Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases through cash flow from operations and from financing activities. The Company had net repayments on short-term borrowings
of $443.6 million during 2010 and issued $496.9 million in long-term debt as more fully discussed below.

The following is a summary of the changes in
the Company’s cash flows followed by a brief discussion of these changes:

MOODY’S

2010 10-K



Net cash provided by operating activities

Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009:

The $9.5 million
increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities resulted from an increase in net income of $106.3 million, which was partially offset by the following:

•

A $27.1 million reduction in cash flow related to a non-cash benefit from deferred income taxes primarily related to basis differences on non-U.S. earnings that
are permanently reinvested as well as accruals for legal and litigation-related costs;

•

A $39.5 million reduction in cash flow due to changes in year-to-date accounts receivable balances from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 compared
to the same periods in 2010. The higher accounts receivable balances in 2010 reflect stronger fundamental ratings issuance in the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 as well as timing of billings for certain software
maintenance fees within the MA segment;

•

An approximate $108 million reduction in cash flows reflecting higher prepaid tax balances in 2010, which are included in other current assets, resulting from
higher than anticipated estimated tax payments in excess of required amounts;

•

A $51.8 million increase in cash flows from UTBs primarily related to a $51 million payment in 2009 for the settlement of a tax audit for the 2001-2007 tax
years;

•

An approximate $29 million increase in cash flows reflecting higher incentive compensation accruals as compared to the prior year, which are included in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities. This increase reflects greater achievement against targeted results in 2010 compared to achievement against targeted results in the prior year and an accrual for a profit sharing contribution based on the
Company’s diluted EPS growth over 2009.

Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008

The following changes in non-cash and other one-time items impacted cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008, relative to net
income:

•

An $11.0 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due primarily to the following items in 2008: an approximate $11 million impairment of certain
software and database intangibles within the MA segment, a $4.5 million write-off of acquired in-process technology relating to the Fermat acquisition and approximately $4 million of accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of the
Company’s New Jersey office. These decreases were partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets in 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008.

•

A $7.8 million non-cash reduction related to the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter in the second quarter of 2008;

•

A $33.8 million increase in deferred income tax expense primarily relating to the settlement of a tax audit for the 2001 – 2007 tax years.

In addition to the non-cash items discussed above and a decrease in net income of $54.5 million, the $104.1 million increase in net
cash flows provided by operating activities was also impacted by the following changes in assets and liabilities:

•

A $168.8 million increase attributed to a reduction in 2009 payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily reflecting lower 2008 incentive
compensation payouts made in the first quarter of 2009 due to weaker financial performance compared to targets in 2008 compared to 2007 as well as lower accrued taxes resulting primarily from the decrease in pre-tax income;

•

A $32.4 million increase relating to the $17.5 million restructuring charge taken in 2009, of which $5 million had not been paid at December 31, 2009,
coupled with lower restructuring payments in 2009 compared to 2008 attributable to the 2007 Restructuring Plan;

•

A $78.4 million increase due to a reduction in other current assets primarily related to prepaid taxes which were used for 2009 estimated income tax payments;

•

An increase in the growth of deferred rent of approximately $15 million due primarily to a free rent period associated with the Canary Wharf lease;

•

A $45.4 million decrease from other liabilities primarily reflecting a $17 million payment for interest to settle a tax audit for the 2001-2007 tax years and a
$12 million reduction to accrued interest for UTB’s;

•

A decrease of approximately $33 million due to a refund of a deposit from the IRS in March 2008 in connection with a Legacy Tax Matter;

•

A $51.8 million decrease in UTBs primarily related to a payment for the settlement of a tax audit for the 2001-2007 tax years;

•

A $41.1 million decrease relating to 5% higher accounts receivable from December 31, 2008 reflecting higher billings related to the gradual improvement in
the credit markets during 2009 compared to a 5% decrease in the December 31, 2008 balance compared to the prior year reflecting lower billings in the later part of 2008 compared to 2009.

Net cash used in investing activities

Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009:

Net cash used in
investing activities in 2010 increased $135.0 million compared to the prior year period and reflected payments made, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of CSI in the fourth quarter of 2010 of $148.6 million. The $11.7 million reduction in
capital expenditures compared to 2009 reflects less costs relating to the build-out the Canary Wharf leased facility in London, England in the current year as the project nears completion partially offset by higher cash outlays relating to the
Company’s continued investment in IT infrastructure.

Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008:

The $225.5 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributed to:

•

A $240.5 million decrease in net cash used resulting from the 2008 acquisitions of Fermat, BQuotes, Financial Projections Limited and Enb Consulting.

Net cash used in financing activities

Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009:

The $107.5 million
decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributed to:

•

Proceeds received of $496.9 million relating to the issuance of the 2010 Senior Notes in August 2010;

Partially offset by:

•

A $223.6 million increase in treasury shares repurchased. There were no share repurchases in 2009 as the Company instead utilized its operating cash flow to
repay outstanding borrowings;

•

A $169.6 million increase in net repayments in short-term borrowings under the Company’s CP program and revolving credit facility.

Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008:

The $1.0 million decrease in net cash flows used in financing activities was primarily attributed to:

•

A $592.9 million decrease in treasury shares repurchased in 2009 compared to 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares during 2009;

Partially offset by:

•

Net repayments of $274.0 million on short-term borrowings resulting from the Company utilizing operating cash flow to repay outstanding borrowings in 2009
compared to net borrowings of $166.3 million in 2008;

•

A $150.0 million decrease relating to proceeds received in May 2008 from the 2008 Term Loan.

Future Cash Requirements

The Company believes that
it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow for the next twelve months. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the
Company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources.

The Company
remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by investing in growing areas of the business, reinvesting in ratings quality initiatives, making selective acquisitions in related businesses, repurchasing stock and
paying a dividend, all in a manner consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity. In December of 2010 the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share of Moody’s common stock, payable on March 10, 2011
to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2011. This is an increase from $0.105 per share of Moody’s common stock paid in each of the preceding four quarters. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all,
is subject to the discretion of the Board. Additionally, the Company intends to repurchase shares at modest levels in 2011 subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions. As of December 31, 2010, Moody’s had $1.2
billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program, which does not have an established expiration.

During the third quarter of
2010, the Company issued $500 million of 2010 Senior Notes due in September 2020, the proceeds of which were or will be used for general corporate purposes, including the redemption and repayment of short-term or long-term borrowings; working
capital needs; capital expenditures; acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets; and purchases of the Company’s common stock under its authorized stock repurchase program. At December 31, 2010, Moody’s had $1.2 billion of
outstanding debt with $1 billion of additional capacity available. Principal payments on the 2008 Term Loan commenced in September 2010 and will continue through its maturity in accordance with the schedule of payments outlined in the
“Indebtedness” section of this MD&A below.

On February 6, 2008, the Company entered into a 17.5 year operating lease agreement to occupy six floors of an
office tower located in the Canary Wharf district of London, England. The total base rent of the Canary Wharf Lease over its 17.5-year term is approximately 134 million GBP, and the Company will begin making base rent payments in 2011. In
addition to the base rent payments the Company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for its share of operating expenses and tax obligations.

On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square-feet of an office building located
at 7WTC at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which is serving as Moody’s headquarters. The 7WTC Lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the 7WTC Lease over
its initial 21-year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. On March 28, 2007, the 7WTC lease agreement was amended
for the Company to lease an additional 78,568 square feet at 7WTC. The additional base rent is approximately $106 million over a 20-year term. The total remaining lease payments as of December 31, 2010, including the aforementioned rent
credits, are approximately $558 million, of which approximately $27 million will be paid during the year ended December 31, 2011.

During the year
ended December 31, 2011, the Company anticipates making contributions of $13.6 million to its funded pension plan, $8.9 million to its unfunded pension plan and $0.6 million to its other-post retirement plans.

Indebtedness

The following table summarizes total
indebtedness:

2007 Facility

On
September 28, 2007, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility, expiring in September 2012. The 2007 Facility will serve, in part, to support the Company’s CP Program described below.
Interest on borrowings is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium that can range from 16.0 to 40.0 basis points of the outstanding borrowing amount depending on the Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees,
regardless of borrowing activity under the 2007 Facility. The quarterly fees for the 2007 Facility can range from 4.0 to 10.0 basis points per annum of the facility amount, depending on the Company’s Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also
pays a utilization fee of 5.0 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding exceeds 50% of the total facility. The 2007 Facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the
Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreement. The
2007 Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter.

Commercial Paper

On October 3, 2007, the Company entered into a private placement commercial paper
program under which the Company may issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The CP Program is supported by the Company’s 2007 Facility. The maturities of the CP Notes
will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of


MOODY’S

2010 10-K


issue. The CP Notes are sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The rates of
interest will depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) certificate of deposit rate; (b) commercial paper rate; (c) the federal funds rate;
(d) the LIBOR; (e) prime rate; (f) Treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement to the private placement agreement. The weighted average interest rate on CP borrowings outstanding was 0.3% as of
December 31, 2009. The CP Program contains certain events of default including, among other things: non-payment of principal, interest or fees; entrance into any form of moratorium; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain
instances to cure periods.

Notes Payable

On
August 19, 2010, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a public offering. The 2010 Senior Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% and mature on September 1, 2020. Interest on the 2010
Senior Notes will be due semi-annually on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2011. The Company may prepay the 2010 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make Whole Amount. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the notes, the Company may be required to purchase all or a portion of the notes upon occurrence of a “Change of Control
Triggering Event,” as defined in the Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the Indenture contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company to consolidate or merge with another
entity or to sell all or substantially all of its assets to another entity. The Indenture contains customary default provisions. In addition, an event of default will occur if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fail to pay the principal of
any indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture) when due at maturity in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more, or a default occurs that results in the acceleration of the maturity of the Company’s or certain of its subsidiaries’
indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the Indenture, the notes may become immediately due and payable either automatically or by the vote of the
holders of more than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the notes then outstanding.

On September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold
through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.06% Series 2007-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 pursuant to the 2007 Agreement. The Series 2007-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at
an annual rate of 6.06%, payable semi-annually on March 7 and September 7. Under the terms of the 2007 Agreement, the Company may, from time to time within five years, in its sole discretion, issue additional series of senior notes in an
aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million pursuant to one or more supplements to the 2007 Agreement. The Company may prepay the Series 2007-1 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make Whole Amount. The 2007 Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: enter into transactions with affiliates,
dispose of assets, incur or create liens, enter into any sale-leaseback transactions, or merge with any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. The Company must also not permit its Debt/EBITDA ratio to exceed
4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter.

On September 30, 2005, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction,
$300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2015 pursuant to the 2005 Agreement. The Series 2005-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi-annually on
March 30 and September 30. Proceeds from the sale of the Series 2005-1 Notes were used to refinance $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s outstanding 7.61% senior notes which matured on September 30, 2005. In
the event that Moody’s pays all, or part, of the Series 2005-1 Notes in advance of their maturity, such prepayment will be subject to a Make Whole Amount. The Series 2005-1 Notes are subject to certain covenants that, among other things,
restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined
in the related agreements.

2008 Term Loan

On
May 7, 2008, Moody’s entered into a five-year, $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan with several lenders. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay off a portion of the CP outstanding. Interest on borrowings under the 2008 Term Loan is
payable quarterly at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a margin that can range from 125 basis points to 175 basis points depending on the Company’s Debt/EBITDA ratio. The outstanding borrowings shall amortize beginning in 2010 in accordance
with the schedule of payments set forth in the 2008 Term Loan outlined in the table below.

The 2008 Term Loan contains restrictive covenants that, among
other things, restrict the ability of the Company to engage or to permit its subsidiaries to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur, or permit its subsidiaries to
incur, liens, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The 2008 Term Loan also limits the amount of debt that subsidiaries of the Company may incur. In addition, the 2008 Term Loan contains a financial covenant that requires the
Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter.

The principal payments due on the Company’s long-term borrowings for each of the next five years are presented in
the table below:

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million which will
convert the fixed rate of interest on the Series 2005-1 Notes to a floating LIBOR-based interest rate. Also, on May 7, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150 million to protect against
fluctuations in the LIBOR-based variable interest rate on the 2008 Term Loan. Both of these interest rate swaps are more fully discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

INTEREST (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET

The following table
summarizes the components of interest as presented in the consolidated statements of operations:

(a)

Represents a reduction of accrued interest related to the favorable resolution of Legacy Tax Matters, further discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

Net interest expense of $33.4 million in 2009 reflects a reduction of approximately $12 million related to tax and tax-related
liabilities.

At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. In addition to the
covenants described above, the 2007 Facility, the 2005 Agreement, the 2007 Agreement, the 2010 Senior Notes and the 2008 Term Loan contain cross default provisions whereby default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit
lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable.

The Company’s
long-term debt, including the current portion, is recorded at cost except for the Series 2005-1 Notes which are carried at cost net of the fair value of an interest rate swap used to hedge the fair value of the note. The fair value and carrying
value of the Company’s long-term debt as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows:

The fair value of the Company’s 2010 Senior Notes is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the remaining long-term
debt, which is not publicly traded, is estimated using discounted cash flows based on prevailing interest rates available to the Company for borrowings with similar maturities.

Management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements
for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2010, Moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities
often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moody’s is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or
limited purposes. As such, Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.

Contractual Obligations

The following table presents payments due under the Company’s contractual
obligations as of December 31, 2010:

(1)

Reflects principal payments, related interest and applicable fees due on the 2008 Term Loan, the Series 2005-1 Notes, the Series 2007-1 Notes, the 2010 Senior Notes, borrowings
under the CP Program and the 2007 Facility, as described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

(2)

Reflects a $2.5 million contingent cash payment related to the November 18, 2010, acquisition of CSI Global Education, Inc. The cash payment is dependent upon the
achievement of a certain contractual milestone by January 2016.

(3)

Reflects projected benefit payments for the next ten years relating to the Company’s U.S. unfunded Post-Retirement Benefit Plans described in Note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements

(4)

The table above does not include the Company’s net long-term tax liabilities of $238.8 million relating to UTP and Legacy Tax Matters, since the expected cash outflow of
such amounts by period cannot be reasonably estimated.

2011 OUTLOOK

Moody’s outlook for 2011 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and
business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the eventual withdrawal of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding
these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. The Company’s guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-year exchange
rates.

For Moody’s overall, the Company expects full-year 2011 revenue to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Full-year 2011 expenses
are expected to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit percent range. Full-year 2011 operating margin is projected between 38% and 40% and the effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 36 percent. Share repurchase is expected to continue
at modest levels in 2011 subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions. The Company expects diluted earnings per share for full-year 2011 in the range of $2.12 to $2.22.

For the global MIS business, revenue for full-year 2011 is expected to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is
expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is projected to increase in the high-single- to low-double-digit percent
range. Structured finance revenue is expected to remain about flat. Revenue from financial institutions is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range, while public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is projected to increase in
the low-double-digit percent range.

For Moody’s Analytics, full-year 2011 revenue is expected to increase in the high-single- to low-double-digit
percent range. Revenue growth is expected in the mid-single-digit percent range for research, data and analytics and in the low- to mid-single-digit percent range for risk management software. Professional services revenue is projected to more than
double, primarily reflecting additional revenue from the acquisition of CSI Global Education. MA revenue is expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range in the U.S. and in the low-double-digit percent range outside the U.S.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Adopted:

In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting
standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. This new standard eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative
reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an enterprise’s involvement in variable interest entities. The Company has adopted
this new accounting standard as of January 1, 2010 and the implementation did not impact its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements” (“ASU 2009-13”). The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and
requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (“VSOE”) if available,
third-party evidence (“TPE”) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (“ESP”) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2009-13 on a prospective basis for applicable
transactions originating or materially modified on or after January 1, 2010. The early adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Further information on the early adoption of
this standard is set forth in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06,
“Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements”. The new standard requires disclosure regarding transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 classifications within the fair value hierarchy as well as requiring further detail of
activity within the Level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy. The new standard also requires disclosures regarding the fair value for each class of assets and liabilities, which is a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in a
company’s balance sheet. Additionally, the standard will require further disclosures surrounding inputs and valuation techniques used in fair value measurements. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures set forth in this
ASU are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the additional disclosures regarding Level 3 fair value measurements, for which the effective date is for fiscal years and interim periods
within those years beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company has adopted the provisions of this ASU as of January 1, 2010 for all new disclosure requirements except for the aforementioned requirements regarding Level 3 fair-value
measurements, for which the Company will adopt that portion of the ASU on January 1, 2011. The portion of this ASU that was adopted on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The Company does not expect the implementation of the remaining portion of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Not yet adopted

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2010-29, “Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations”. The objective of this ASU is to address diversity in practice regarding proforma disclosures for revenue and earnings of the acquired entity.
The amendments in this ASU specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year
had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The amendments in this ASU also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under ASC Topic 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material,
nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The
Company will conform to the disclosure requirements set forth in this ASU for any future material business combinations.

CONTINGENCIES

From time to time,
Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing
tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending
legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

Following the events in the U.S. subprime
residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly over the last several years, MIS and other credit rating agencies are the subject of intense scrutiny, increased regulation, ongoing investigation, and civil litigation. Legislative,
regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation, regulation and enforcement actions, including with respect to MIS’s compliance with newly imposed regulatory standards. Moody’s has received
subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries.

In
addition, the Company is facing litigation from market participants relating to the performance of MIS rated securities. Although Moody’s in the normal course experiences such litigation, the volume and cost of defending such litigation has
significantly increased in the current economic environment.

On June 27, 2008, the Brockton Contributory Retirement System, a purported shareholder of the Company’s
securities, filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. The
plaintiff asserts various causes of action relating to the named defendants’ oversight of MIS’s ratings of RMBS and constant-proportion debt obligations, and their participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading
information about MIS’s ratings practices and/or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement of profits and other equitable
relief. On July 2, 2008, Thomas R. Flynn, a purported shareholder of the Company’s securities, filed a similar purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the
Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, asserting similar claims and seeking the same relief. The cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in
November 2008. The Company removed the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in December 2008. In January 2009, the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, which the Company opposed. On February 23, 2010, the court issued an opinion remanding the case to the Supreme Court of New York. On October 30, 2008, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System, a purported
shareholder of the Company’s securities, also filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. This complaint also asserts various causes of action relating to the Company’s ratings of RMBS, CDO and constant-proportion debt obligations, and named defendants’ participation in the alleged public dissemination of
false and misleading information about MIS’s ratings practices and/or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. On December 9, 2008, Rena Nadoff, a purported shareholder of the Company,
filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and its CEO, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty in
connection with alleged overrating of asset-backed securities and underrating of municipal securities. On October 20, 2009, the Company moved to dismiss or stay the action in favor of related federal litigation. On January 26, 2010, the
court entered a stipulation and order, submitted jointly by the parties, staying the Nadoff litigation pending coordination and prosecution of similar claims in the above and below described federal derivative actions. On July 6, 2009, W. A.
Sokolowski, a purported shareholder of the Company, filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and current and former officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts claims relating to alleged mismanagement of the Company’s processes for rating structured finance transactions, alleged insider trading and causing the Company to buy
back its own stock at artificially inflated prices.

Two purported class action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the Company’s
securities against the Company and certain of its senior officers, asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The first was filed by Raphael Nach in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 19, 2007. The
second was filed by Teamsters Local 282 Pension Trust Fund in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 26, 2007. Both actions have been consolidated into a single proceeding entitled In re Moody’s
Corporation Securities Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 27, 2008, a consolidated amended complaint was filed, purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities during
the period February 3, 2006 through October 24, 2007. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false and/or misleading statements concerning the Company’s business conduct, business prospects, business conditions and financial
results relating primarily to MIS’s ratings of structured finance products including RMBS, CDO and constant-proportion debt obligations. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the case. The Company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in September 2008. On February 23, 2009, the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims and sustaining others.

Moody’s Analytics is cooperating with an investigation by the SEC concerning services provided by that unit to certain financial institutions in connection
with the valuations used by those institutions with respect to certain financial instruments held by such institutions.

For claims, litigation and
proceedings not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and
periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As
additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, enforcement and similar matters and
contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the
pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve the pending matters referred to above progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such
matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the inherent

MOODY’S

2010 10-K



uncertainties involved in these matters, the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them and the novel theories of law asserted, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be
made at this time. For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent)
that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this
more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

Legacy Tax Matters

Moody’s continues to have
exposure to potential liabilities arising from Legacy Tax Matters. As of December 31, 2010, Moody’s has recorded liabilities for Legacy Tax Matters totaling $59.3 million. This includes liabilities and accrued interest due to New D&B
arising from the 2000 Distribution Agreement. It is possible that the ultimate liability for Legacy Tax Matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to
Moody’s future reported results, financial position and cash flows.

The following summary of the relationships among Moody’s, New D&B and
their predecessor entities is important in understanding the Company’s exposure to the Legacy Tax Matters.

In November 1996, The Dun &
Bradstreet Corporation separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation and Cognizant Corporation. In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into two separate
public companies: Old D&B and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998, Cognizant separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. In September 2000, Old D&B separated into two separate
public companies: New D&B and Moody’s.

Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of
business. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Old D&B and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes, penalties and interest resulting
from unfavorable IRS determinations on certain tax matters, and certain other potential tax liabilities, all as described in such agreements. Further, in connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution
Agreement, New D&B and Moody’s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to these Legacy Tax Matters.

At the time of the 2000 Distribution, New D&B paid Moody’s $55.0 million for 50% of certain anticipated future tax benefits through 2012. In the event that
these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by New D&B, or there is an IRS audit of New D&B impacting these tax benefits, Moody’s would be required to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its
share of the related future tax benefits as well as its share of any tax liability incurred by New D&B. As of December 31, 2010, Moody’s liability with respect to this matter totaled $57.3 million. In 2008, as part of this matter and
due to a statue of limitations expiration, Moody’s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of $2.3 million ($1.4 million, net of tax) and an increase in other non-operating income of $6.4 million relating to amounts due to New D&B.

In 2005, settlement agreements were executed with the IRS with respect to certain Legacy Tax Matters related to the years 1989-1990 and 1993-1996. With
respect to these settlements, Moody’s and New D&B believed that IMS Health and NMR did not pay their full share of the liability to the IRS under the terms of the applicable separation agreements between the parties. Moody’s and New
D&B subsequently paid these amounts to the IRS and commenced arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to resolve this dispute. This resulted in settlement payments to Moody’s of $6.7 million in 2008 ($6.1 million as a reduction of
interest expense and $0.6 million as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense) and $10.8 million ($6.5 million as a reduction of interest expense and $4.3 million as a reduction of tax expense) in 2009. The aforementioned
settlement payments resulted in net income benefits of $4 million and $8.2 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The Company continues to carry a $2 million liability for this matter.

In 2006, New D&B and Moody’s each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. In
2007, New D&B and Moody’s requested a return of that deposit. The IRS applied a portion of our deposit in satisfaction of an assessed deficiency and returned the balance to the Company. Moody’s subsequently pursued a refund for a
portion of the outstanding amount. In May 2010, the IRS refunded $5.2 million to us for the 1997 tax year, which included interest of approximately $2.5 million resulting in an after-tax benefit of $4.6 million.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Moody’s Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the SEC in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Moody’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Moody’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company has undertaken an assessment of
the design and operational effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The COSO framework is based upon five integrated components of control: risk assessment, control activities, control environment, information and communications and ongoing monitoring.

Based on the assessment performed, management has concluded that Moody’s maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2010.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Moody’s Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Moody’s Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
shareholders’ deficit, for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. We also have audited Moody’s Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Moody’s Corporation’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Moody’s
Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Also in our opinion, Moody’s Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) risk management
software and (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, credit portfolio management solutions, training, and financial credentialing and certification services. In 2007 and prior years, Moody’s operated in two reportable segments:
Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV. Beginning in January 2008, Moody’s segments were changed to reflect the Reorganization announced in August 2007 and Moody’s now reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA. As a
result of the Reorganization, the rating agency remains in the MIS operating segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moody’s other non-rating commercial activities are included within the Moody’s Analytics
segment. The MIS segment publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS’s
ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors. The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the credit risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. These
offerings include quantitative credit risk scores, credit processing software, economic research, analytical models, financial data, and specialized advisory, training, financial credentialing and certification services. MA also distributes
investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its rating process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, and commentary on topical events.

The Company operated as part of Old D&B until September 30, 2000, when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies – Moody’s Corporation and New D&B. At that time, Old D&B
distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company. The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing
ratings and related research and credit risk management services and was renamed Moody’s Corporation. For purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between the Company and New D&B after the 2000 Distribution and to provide for an
orderly transition, the Company and New D&B entered into various agreements including a distribution agreement, tax allocation agreement and employee benefits agreement.

NOTE 2

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include those of Moody’s Corporation and its majority- and wholly-owned subsidiaries. The
effects of all intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies for which the Company has significant influence over operating and financial policies but not a controlling interest are accounted for on an equity basis.

The Company applies the guidelines set forth in Topic 810 of the ASC in assessing its interests in variable interest entities to decide whether to
consolidate that entity. The Company has reviewed the potential variable interest entities and determined that there are no consolidation requirements under Topic 810 of the ASC.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents principally consist of investments in money market mutual funds and
high-grade commercial paper with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was $3.1 million, $2.5 million and $12.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not extend the economic useful life
of the related assets are charged to expense as incurred.

Research and Development Costs

All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs primarily reflect the development of credit processing software and quantitative credit risk assessment products sold by the MA segment.
These costs also reflect expenses for new quantitative research and business ideas that potentially warrant near-term investment within MIS or MA which could potentially result in commercial opportunities for the Company.

2010 10-K



Research and development costs were $20.3 million, $14.3 million and $13.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are included in operating expenses within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. These costs generally consist of professional services provided by third parties and
compensation costs of employees.

Costs for internally developed computer software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized when
technological feasibility has been established. These costs primarily relate to the development or enhancement of credit processing software and quantitative credit risk assessment products sold by the MA segment that will be licensed to customers
and generally consist of professional services provided by third parties and compensation costs of employees that develop the software. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and the Company
believes that technological feasibility for its software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to customers.
Accordingly, costs for internally developed computer software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed that were eligible for capitalization under Topic 985 of the ASC as well as the related amortization expense related to such costs were
immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

The Company capitalizes costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use. These assets, included in property and equipment in the consolidated
balance sheets, relate to the Company’s accounting, product delivery and other systems. Such costs generally consist of direct costs of third-party license fees, professional services provided by third parties and employee compensation, in each
case incurred either during the application development stage or in connection with upgrades and enhancements that increase functionality. Such costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Costs incurred during
the preliminary project stage of development as well as maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other
Acquired Intangible Assets

Goodwill is tested for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually on November 30

th

or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired, in
accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350. If the estimated fair value, which is based on a discounted cash flow methodology, is less than its carrying amount, the Company would proceed to step two of the impairment test as prescribed by Topic
350 of the ASC. Under step two, the estimated fair value of the reporting units would be allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to derive the implied fair value of the goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill
determined under step two of the impairment test is less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference. The discounted cash flow methodology used to value the reporting units is based on the present value of
the cash flows that the Company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future. The significant estimates used to derive the present value of the cash flows include the reporting units WACC and future growth rates.

Finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the carrying amount of the related asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset.

Rent Expense

The Company records rent expense on
a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. In cases where there is a free rent period or future fixed rent escalations the Company will record a deferred rent liability. Additionally, the receipt of any lease incentives will be recorded as a
deferred rent liability which will be amortized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records compensation expense for all share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the
time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. The Company has also established a pool of additional paid-in capital related to the tax effects of
employee share-based compensation (“APIC Pool”), which is available to absorb any recognized tax deficiencies.

Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

Based on the Company’s risk management policy, from time to time the Company may use derivative financial instruments to
reduce exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their
respective fair values. The changes in the value of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are recorded currently into earnings. Changes in the derivative’s fair value that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded as other comprehensive
income or loss, to the extent the hedge is effective, and such amounts are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements”
(“ASU 2009-13”). The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of
each deliverable. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2009-13 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or after January 1, 2010. If applied in the same manner to the year ended
December 31, 2009, ASU 2009-13 would not have had a material impact on net revenue reported for both its MIS and MA segments in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a significant
effect on the Company’s net revenue in the period of adoption and is also not expected to have a significant effect on the Company’s net revenue in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on
the currently anticipated business volume and pricing.

For 2010 and future periods, pursuant to the guidance of ASU 2009-13, when a sales arrangement
contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or
estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

The Company’s products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate
units of accounting under ASU 2009-13. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value
to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item, the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. In
instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.

The Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the VSOE criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. In instances where the Company is not able
to establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales
history, the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers.
However, due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in the Company’s market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of
differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASU
2009-13, when the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company
establishes its best estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service
relative to a related product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and
ESP on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.

In the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when
the rating is issued. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, derivatives,
international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated
securities, which ranged from two to 51 years at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $76 million, $78 million and $82 million, respectively.

Multiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. Beginning January 1,
2010, in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The
Company generally uses ESP in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings.
Prior to January 1, 2010 and pursuant to the previous accounting standards, for these types of arrangements the initial rating fee was first allocated to the monitoring service determined based on the estimated fair market value of monitoring
services, with the residual amount allocated to the initial rating. Under ASU 2009-13 this practice can no longer be used for non-software deliverables upon the adoption of ASU 2009-13.

MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on
estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2010,

MOODY’S

2010 10-K



2009 and 2008, accounts receivable included approximately $25 million, $27 million and $34 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had
material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings.

In the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include
software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is
recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or
transferred to and accepted by the customer. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from services rendered within the professional services line of business is generally recognized as the
services are performed. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs.

Products and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element
arrangement includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based
on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.

If
the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to
determine VSOE for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an
undelivered element, the Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements.

Prior to January 1, 2010 and pursuant to the previous accounting standards, the Company allocated revenue in a multiple element arrangement to each deliverable
based on its relative fair value, or for software elements, based on VSOE. If the fair value was not available for an undelivered element, the revenue for the entire arrangement was deferred.

Accounts Receivable Allowances

Moody’s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer
billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt
expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Billing adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are recorded against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and
assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need
for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody’s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses are charged to income as incurred. These expenses include costs associated with the development and production of the
Company’s products and services and their delivery to customers. These expenses principally include employee compensation and benefits and travel costs that are incurred in connection with these activities.

Restructuring

The Company’s restructuring accounting
follows the provisions of: Topic 712 of the ASC for severance relating to employee terminations, Topic 715 of the ASC for pension settlements and curtailments, and Topic 420 of the ASC for contract termination costs and other exit activities.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses are charged to income as incurred. These expenses include such items as compensation and benefits for corporate officers and staff and
compensation and other expenses related to sales of products. They also include items such as office rent, business insurance, professional fees and gains and losses from sales and disposals of assets.

Foreign Currency Translation

For all operations outside the
U.S. where the Company has designated the local currency as the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of year exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for
the year. For these foreign operations, currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income represents the change in net assets of a business enterprise during a period due to transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources including foreign currency translation
impacts, net actuarial losses and net prior service costs related to pension and other post-retirement plans and impacts related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income is primarily
comprised of:

Income Taxes

The Company
accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with Topic 740 of the ASC. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary
differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.

The Company classifies interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized in other non-operating expenses.
For UTPs the Company first determines whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing
authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty
percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

For certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, the Company has deemed a
portion of its undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations. Accordingly, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. It is not
practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future, due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company’s financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables, payables and short-term borrowings, all of which are short-term in nature and, accordingly, approximate fair value. Additionally, the Company invests in
short-term investments that are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company also has long-term debt which is described in detail in Note 14. Also, the Company uses derivative instruments, as further
described in Note 5, to manage certain financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. These derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Fair value is defined by the ASC as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The determination of this fair value is based on the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company could commence transactions and considers assumptions that market
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. Also, determination of fair value assumes that market participants will consider the highest and best use of the
asset.

The ASC establishes a fair value hierarchy whereby the inputs contained in valuation techniques used to measure fair value are categorized into
three broad levels as follows:

Level 1

: quoted market prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the date of
the fair value measurement;

Level 2

: inputs other than quoted market prices described in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities;

Level 3

: unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value measurement of the assets or liabilities.

Refer to Note 5 and Note 11 for specific valuation methodologies related to the Company’s derivative instruments
and pension assets.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments
and trade receivables.

Cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment-grade securities within and outside the U.S. The Company
manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high-grade commercial paper. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and high-grade corporate
bonds in Korea as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short-term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. No customer accounted for 10% or more of
accounts receivable at December 31, 2010 or 2009.

Earnings per Share of Common Stock

Basic EPS is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is calculated giving
effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, assuming that such shares were outstanding during the reporting period.

Pension and Other
Post-Retirement Benefits

Moody’s maintains various noncontributory DBPPs as well as other contributory and noncontributory retirement and
post-retirement plans. The expense and assets/liabilities that the Company reports for its pension and other post-retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions
represent the Company’s best estimates and may vary by plan. The differences between the assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and actual experience is spread over a five-year period to the market related value of
plan assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual pension expense. All other actuarial gains and losses are generally deferred and amortized over the estimated average future working life of active plan
participants.

The Company recognizes, as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position, the funded status of its defined benefit
post-retirement plans, measured on a plan-by-plan basis. Changes in the funded status are recorded as part of other comprehensive income during the period the changes occur.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, income taxes, contingencies, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, goodwill, pension and
other post-retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization rates for property and equipment and computer software.

The
financial market volatility and poor economic conditions beginning in the third quarter of 2007 and continuing into 2010, both in the U.S. and in many other countries where the Company operates, have impacted and will continue to impact Moody’s
business. If such conditions were to recur they could have a material impact to the Company’s significant accounting estimates discussed above, in particular those around accounts receivable allowances, valuations of investments in affiliates,
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and pension and other post-retirement benefits.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Adopted:

In June 2009, the FASB
issued a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. This new standard eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and
requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an enterprise’s involvement in variable interest
entities. The Company has adopted this new accounting standard as of January 1, 2010 and the implementation did not impact its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements” (“ASU 2009-13”). The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units
of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation

of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price if
available, third-party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2009-13 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or
materially modified on or after January 1, 2010. The early adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Further information on the early adoption of this standard is set forth in
this note above, under “Revenue Recognition”.

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06, “Improving Disclosures about Fair
Value Measurements”. The new standard requires disclosure regarding transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 classifications within the fair value hierarchy as well as requiring further detail of activity within the Level 3 category of the
fair value hierarchy. The new standard also requires disclosures regarding the fair value for each class of assets and liabilities, which is a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in a company’s balance sheet. Additionally, the
standard will require further disclosures surrounding inputs and valuation techniques used in fair value measurements. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures set forth in this ASU are effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the additional disclosures regarding Level 3 fair value measurements, for which the effective date is for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after
December 15, 2010. The Company has adopted the provisions of this ASU as of January 1, 2010 for all new disclosure requirements except for the aforementioned requirements regarding Level 3 fair-value measurements, for which the Company
will adopt that portion of the ASU on January 1, 2011. The portion of this ASU that was adopted on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect the
implementation of the remaining portion of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Not yet adopted

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-29, “Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations”.
The objective of this ASU is to address diversity in practice regarding proforma disclosures for revenue and earnings of the acquired entity. The amendments in this ASU specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the
entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The amendments in
this ASU also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under ASC Topic 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the
reported pro forma revenue and earnings. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The Company will conform to the disclosure requirements set forth in this ASU for any future material
business combinations.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

NOTE 3

RECONCILIATION OF WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING

Below

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

Short-term investments are securities
with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase that are available for use in the Company’s operations in the next twelve months. The short-term investments, primarily consisting of certificates of deposit, are classified as
held-to-maturity and therefore are carried at cost. The remaining contractual maturities of the short-term investments were one to six months and one to three months as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest and dividends are
recorded into income when earned.

NOTE 5

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company is
exposed to global market risks, including risks from changes in FX rates and changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the Company uses derivatives in certain instances to manage the aforementioned financial exposures that occur in the normal course
of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative purposes.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company entered into interest
rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million to convert the fixed interest rate on the Series 2005-1 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the 3-month LIBOR. The purpose of this hedge was to mitigate the risk associated with changes
in the fair value of the Series 2005-1 Notes, thus the Company has designated these swaps as fair value hedges. As a result, the fair value of the swaps and changes in the fair value of the underlying debt are reported in other liabilities and as a
reduction of the carrying amount of the Series 2005-1 Notes, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The changes in the fair value of the hedges and the underlying hedged item generally offset and the net cash settlements on the swaps are recorded each
period within interest income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The net interest income recognized in interest income (expense), net on these swaps was immaterial in 2010.

In May 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150.0 million to protect against fluctuations in the LIBOR-based variable
interest rate on the 2008 Term Loan, further described in Note 14. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges.

The Company also enters
into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under
the applicable sections of Topic 815 of the ASC. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately in other non-operating (expense) income, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations along with
the FX gain or loss recognized on the assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency. The notional principal of foreign exchange forwards to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was
approximately $17 million at December 31, 2010. The notional principal of foreign exchange forwards to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was approximately $96 million at December 31, 2010 and approximately $66 million at
December 31, 2009. The notional principal amounts of foreign exchange forwards to purchase euros with other foreign currencies was approximately 11 million euros at December 31, 2010 and approximately 10 million euros at December 31,
2009. The net gains (losses) on these instruments recognized in other non-operating income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations was $(3.0) million and $3.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company engaged in hedging activities to protect against FX risks from forecasted billings and related revenue denominated in the euro and the GBP. FX options
and forward exchange contracts were utilized to hedge exposures related to changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2010, all FX options and forward exchange contracts have matured. The hedging program mainly utilized FX options. The FX options
and forward exchange contracts were designated as cash flow hedges.

The following table summarizes the notional amounts of the Company’s
outstanding FX options:

The tables below show the classification between assets and liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets of the fair value of derivative
instruments as well as information on gains/(losses) on those instruments:


MOODY’S

2010 10-K


The fair value of the interest rate swaps is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. The fair value of the FX forwards is included in other current assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2010 and
2009. All of the above derivative instruments are valued using Level 2 inputs as defined in Topic 820 of the ASC as more fully discussed in Note 2. In determining the fair value of the derivative contracts in the table above, the Company utilizes
industry standard valuation models when active market quotes are not available. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using spot rates, forward points, currency volatilities,
interest rates as well as the risk of non-performance of the Company and the counterparties with whom it has derivative contracts. The Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial
institutions that adhere to these guidelines. Accordingly, the risk of counterparty default is deemed to be minimal.

All gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes are initially recognized through AOCI.
Realized gains and losses reported in AOCI are reclassified into earnings (into revenue for the FX options and into Interest income (expense), net for the interest rate swaps) as the underlying transaction is recognized. The existing realized losses
as of December 31, 2010 expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months is immaterial.

The cumulative amount of unrecognized
hedge losses recorded in AOCI is as follows:

ACQUISITIONS

All of the acquisitions described below were
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby the purchase price is allocated first to the net assets of the acquired entity based on the fair value of its net assets. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net

CSI Global Education, Inc.

On November 18, 2010, a subsidiary of the Company acquired CSI Global Education, Inc., Canada’s leading provider of financial learning, credentials, and

resource to financial market participants.

The aggregate purchase price was $151.4 million in net cash payments to the sellers. There is a
2.5 million Canadian dollar contingent cash payment which is dependent upon the achievement of a certain contractual milestone by January 2016. The Company has recognized the fair value of the contingent payment of $2.0 million as a long-term
liability at the acquisition date using a discounted cash flow methodology which assumes that the entire 2.5 million Canadian dollar payment will be made by January 2016. This methodology is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the
market, which ASC 820 refers to as Level 3 inputs. Subsequent fair value changes, which will be measured quarterly, up to the ultimate amount paid, will be recognized in earnings. The purchase price was funded with cash on hand.

Shown below is the purchase price allocation, which summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, at the date of acquisition:

Current assets include acquired cash of approximately $2.8 million. The acquired goodwill, which has been assigned to the MA segment,
will not be amortized and will not be deductible for tax. As of December 31, 2010, CSI operates as its own reporting unit and thus goodwill associated with the acquisition of CSI is all part of that reporting unit within the MA segment. CSI
will remain a separate reporting unit until MA management completes its evaluation as to how the acquired entity will be integrated into the MA segment.

The amount of revenue and expenses included in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date through December 31, 2010 was
not material. The near term impact to operations and cash flow from this acquisition is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Enb Consulting Ltd.

In December 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired Enb Consulting Ltd., a provider of
credit and capital markets training services. The purchase price was not material and the impact to operations and cash flow is not material. Enb is part of the MA segment.

Fermat International SA

On October 9, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired Fermat International SA,
a provider of risk and performance management software to the global banking sector, which is now part of the MA segment. The combination of MA’s credit portfolio management and economic capital tools with Fermat’s expertise in risk
management software positions MA to deliver comprehensive analytical solutions for financial institutions worldwide. The results of Fermat are reflected in the MA operating segment since the acquisition date.

The aggregate purchase price of $211 million consisted of $204.5 million in cash payments to the sellers and $6.5 million in direct transaction costs, primarily
professional fees. The purchase price was funded by using Moody’s cash on hand.

write-off is included in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008. Current assets include acquired cash of approximately $26 million.

BQuotes, Inc.

In January 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired BQuotes, Inc., a global provider of price
discovery tools and end-of-day pricing services for a wide range of fixed income securities, which was part of the MA segment. The purchase price was not material and the impact to operations and cash flow was not material.

Financial Projections Ltd.

In January 2008, a subsidiary of
the Company acquired Financial Projections Ltd., a leading provider of in-house credit training services, with long-standing relationships among European banks. The purchase price was not material and the impact to operations and cash flow is not

Estimated future annual amortization expense for
intangible assets subject to amortization is as follows:

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the carrying amount of the related asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and
the estimated fair value of the asset. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of November 30th, or more frequently if circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired.

For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no impairments to goodwill or to intangible assets except for an immaterial $0.2 million impairment of intangible assets in 2009 which was included in the
restructuring charge as further discussed in Note 10 below. In 2008 an impairment of $11.1 million was recognized for certain software and database intangible assets within the MA segment, which is reflected in amortization expense. These intangible
assets were determined to be impaired as a result of comparing the carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows of the related asset group expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. The Company measured the amount of
the impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount of the related assets to their fair value. The fair value was determined by utilizing the expected present value technique which uses multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect the range of
possible outcomes and a risk-free rate.

RESTRUCTURING

On March 27, 2009 the Company approved
the 2009 Restructuring Plan to reduce costs in response to a strategic review of its business in certain jurisdictions and the then current weak global economic and market conditions. The 2009 Restructuring Plan consisted of headcount reductions of
approximately 150 positions representing approximately 4% of the Company’s workforce at December 31, 2008 as well as contract termination costs and the divestiture of non-strategic assets. The Company’s plan included closing offices
in South Bend, Indiana;

Jakarta, Indonesia and Taipei, Taiwan. There was $0.2 million in accelerated amortization for intangible assets recognized in the first quarter of 2009 relating to the closure of the Jakarta,
Indonesia office. The cumulative amount of expense incurred from inception through December 31, 2010 for the 2009 Restructuring Plan was $14.7 million. The 2009 Restructuring Plan was substantially complete at September 30, 2009.

On December 31, 2007, the Company approved the 2007 Restructuring Plan that reduced global headcount by approximately 275 positions, or
approximately 7.5% of the workforce at December 31, 2007, in response to the Company’s reorganization announced in August 2007 and a decline in the then current and anticipated issuance of rated debt securities in some market sectors.
Included in the 2007 Restructuring Plan was a reduction of staff as a result of: (i) consolidation of certain corporate staff functions, (ii) the integration of businesses comprising MA and (iii) an anticipated decline in new
securities issuance in some market sectors. The 2007 Restructuring Plan also called for the termination of technology contracts as well as the outsourcing of certain technology functions. The cumulative amount of expense incurred from inception
through December 31, 2010 for the 2007 Restructuring Plan was $50.4 million. The 2007 Restructuring Plan was substantially complete as of December 31, 2008.

Total expenses included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are as follows:

The expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008 related to the 2007 Restructuring Plan primarily reflects adjustments to previous estimates.

Changes to the restructuring liability for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

As of December 31, 2010 the remaining restructuring liability of $0.7 million relating to severance and contract termination
costs is expected to be paid out during the year ending December 31, 2011. Payments related to the $5.1 million unfunded pension liability will be paid as certain of the affected employees reach retirement age and continue in accordance with
plan provisions.

Severance and contract termination costs of $0.7 million and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009,

PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Moody’s
maintains funded and unfunded noncontributory Defined Benefit Pension Plans. The U.S. plans provide defined benefits using a cash balance formula based on years of service and career average salary or final average pay for selected executives. The
Company also provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired U.S. employees. These post-retirement healthcare plans are contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are
noncontributory. Moody’s funded and unfunded U.S. pension plans, the U.S. post-retirement healthcare plans and the U.S. post-retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the “Post-Retirement Plans”. Effective
at the Distribution Date, Moody’s assumed responsibility for the pension and other post-retirement benefits relating to its active employees. New D&B has assumed responsibility for the Company’s retirees and vested terminated employees
as of the Distribution Date.

Through 2007, substantially all U.S. employees were eligible to participate in the Company’s DBPPs. Effective
January 1, 2008, the Company no longer offers DBPPs to employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 and new hires instead will receive a retirement contribution in similar benefit value under the Company’s Profit
Participation Plan. Current participants of the Company’s DBPPs continue to accrue benefits based on existing plan benefit formulas.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

Assumptions – Post-Retirement Plans

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations
at December 31:

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net
periodic benefit expense for years ended December 31:

For 2011, the Company continued to use an expected rate
of return on assets of 8.35% for Moody’s funded pension plan. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the Company’s best estimate of the long-term return on plan assets and is determined by using a building block approach,
which generally weighs the underlying long-term expected rate of return for each major asset class based on their respective allocation target within the plan portfolio. As the assumption reflects a long-term time horizon, the plan performance in
any one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence the Company’s evaluation and the assumption is generally not revised unless there is a significant change in one of the factors upon which it is based, such as target asset
allocation or long-term capital market conditions.

Assumed Healthcare Cost Trend Rates at December 31:

The assumed health cost trend rate reflects different
expectations for the medical and prescribed medication components of health care costs for pre and post-65 retirees. The Company revised its trend rates in 2010 to a slower grading period at a reduction of 0.5% per year to reach the ultimate
trend rate of 5% in 2020 to reflect its current expectation as the Company believes the historical trend rate assumptions used have been decreased too quickly relative to actual trend. As the Company subsidies for retiree healthcare coverage are
capped at the 2005 level, for the majority of the post-retirement health plan participants, retiree contributions are assumed to increase at the same rate as the healthcare cost trend rates. As such, a one percentage-point increase or decrease in
assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have affected total service and interest cost and would have a minimal impact on the post-retirement benefit obligation.

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Act”) and the related reconciliation measure, which modifies certain provisions of the Act, were signed into law. The Act repeals the
current rule permitting deduction of the portion of the drug coverage expense that is offset by the Medicare Part D subsidy. The provision of the Act is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010 and the reconciliation
measure delays the aforementioned repeal of the drug coverage expense reduction by two years to December 31, 2012. The Company has accounted for the enactment of the two laws in the first quarter of 2010, for which the impact to the
Company’s income tax expense and net income was immaterial. Other key provisions of the Act, such as coverage mandates, early retiree reinsurance program, and excise tax are also considered and their impacts on the benefit plan obligation of
the Company’s Other Post-Retirement Plans are deemed immaterial.

Plan Assets – Post-Retirement Plans

Moody’s investment objective for the assets in the funded pension plan is to earn total returns that will minimize future contribution requirements over the long-term within a prudent level of risk. The
Company works with its independent investment consultants to determine asset allocation targets for its pension plan investment portfolio based on its assessment of business and financial conditions, demographic and actuarial data, funding
characteristics, and related risk factors. Other relevant factors, including historical and forward –looking views of inflation and capital market returns, are also considered. Risk management practices include monitoring of the plan,
diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. The Company’s monitoring of the plan includes ongoing reviews of investment performance, annual liability measurements,
periodic asset/liability studies, and investment portfolio reviews.

Prior to 2009, the Company’s target asset allocation was approximately 70% in
diversified U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities, 20% in long-duration investment grade government and corporate bonds, and 10% in private real estate funds. In 2009, the Company revised its target asset allocation to approximately 60% (range of 50%
to 70%) in equity securities, 30% (range of 25% to 35%) in fixed income securities and 10% (range of 7% to 13%) in other investments. The revised asset allocation policy is based on the Company’s pension asset-liability study and is expected to
earn a return comparable to its 2008 allocation target over the long-term. The Company has rebalanced its pension plan assets in 2010 to comply with the revised asset allocation policy.

In accordance with the revised asset allocation policy, the funded plan will use a combination of active and passive investment strategies and different investment styles for its investment portfolios within each
asset class. The plan’s equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks of small, medium and large capitalization. The plan’s fixed income investments are diversified principally across U.S. and non-U.S. government and
corporate bonds, which is expected to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with obligations. Approximately 3% of total plan assets may be invested in funds which invest in debts rated below investment grade
and 3% may be invested in emerging market debt. The plan’s other investments are made through private real estate and convertible securities funds and these investments are expected to provide additional diversification benefits and absolute
return enhancement to the plan assets. The Company does not use derivatives to leverage the portfolio. The overall allocation is expected to help protect the plan’s funded status while generating sufficiently stable returns over the long-term.

The fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets by asset category at December 31, 2010 and 2009, determined based on the hierarchy of
fair value measurements as defined in Note 2 and are as follows:


MOODY’S

2010 10-K


Cash and cash equivalents is primarily comprised of investment in money market mutual funds. In determining fair value, Level 1
investments are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Investments in common/collective trust funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) per unit in each fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying investments
owned by each trust, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Common/collective trust funds are categorized in Level 2 to the extent that they are readily redeemable at their NAV or else they are categorized in
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s investment in a private real estate fund is valued using the NAV per unit of funds that are invested in real property, and the real property is valued using independent market appraisals. Since
appraisals involve utilization of significant unobservable inputs and the private real estate fund is not readily redeemable for cash, the Company’s investment in the private real estate fund is categorized in Level 3.

The table below is a summary of changes in the fair value of the Plan’s Level 3 assets:

Except for the Company’s U.S. funded pension plan, all of Moody’s Post-Retirement Plans are unfunded and therefore have no
plan assets.

Cash Flows – Post-Retirement Plans

The Company made no contribution to its funded pension plan during the year ended December 31, 2010 and contributed $5.8 million to its funded plan in 2009. The Company made payments of $8.8 million
and $2.2 million related to its U.S. unfunded pension plan obligations during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The payments made in 2010 include a settlement payment to a participant terminated under the 2007
Restructuring Plan as more fully described in Note 10 above. The Company made payments of $0.5 million and $0.9 million to its other U.S. post-retirement plans during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company
presently anticipates making a lump-sum contribution of $13.6 million to its funded pension plan in the first quarter of 2011 and anticipates making payments of $8.9 million to its unfunded U.S. pension plans and $0.6 million to its other U.S.
post-retirement plans during the year ended December 31, 2011.

*

The estimated future benefits payable for the Post-Retirement Plans are reflected net of the expected Medicare Part D subsidy for which the subsidy is insignificant on an annual
basis for all the years presented.

Defined Contribution Plans

Moody’s has a Profit Participation Plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. The Profit Participation Plan provides for an employee salary deferral and the Company matches employee contributions with
cash contributions equal to 50% of employee contributions up to a maximum of 3% of the employee’s pay. Moody’s also makes additional contributions to the Profit Participation Plan based on year-to-year growth in the Company’s diluted
EPS. Effective January 1, 2008, all new hires are automatically enrolled in the Profit Participation Plan when they meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. As the Company’s U.S. DBPPs are closed to new entrants
effective January 1, 2008, all eligible new hires will instead receive a retirement contribution into the Profit Participation Plan in value similar to the pension benefits. Additionally, effective January 1, 2008, the Company implemented
a deferred compensation plan in the U.S., which is unfunded and provides for employee deferral of compensation and Company matching contributions related to compensation in excess of the IRS limitations on benefits and contributions under qualified
retirement plans. Total expenses associated with the U.S. defined contribution plans were $19.4 million, $9.1 million and $8.0 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2008, Moody’s has designated the Moody’s Stock Fund, an investment option under the Profit Participation Plan, as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and, as a result, participants
in the Moody’s Stock Fund may receive dividends in cash or may reinvest such dividends into the Moody’s Stock Fund. Moody’s paid approximately $0.3 million in dividends in each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 for
the Company’s common shares held by the Moody’s Stock Fund. The Company records the dividends as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit). The Moody’s Stock Fund held
approximately 645,000 and 669,000 shares of Moody’s common stock at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

International Plans

Certain of the Company’s international operations provide pension benefits to their employees. For defined contribution plans, company
contributions are primarily determined as a percentage of employees’ eligible compensation. Moody’s also makes contributions to non-U.S. employees under a profit sharing plan which is based on year-to-year growth in the Company’s
diluted EPS. Expenses related to these defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $11.8 million, $5.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively.

For defined benefit plans, the Company maintains various unfunded DBPPs and post-retirement health benefit plan for certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries located in Germany, France and Canada. These defined plan
benefits are generally based on each eligible employee’s years of credited service and on compensation levels as specified in the plans. The DBPP in Germany was closed to new entrants in 2002. Total defined benefit pension liabilities recorded
related to non-U.S. pension plans was $4.6 million, $3.6 million, and $3.0 million based on a weighted average discount rate of 5.28%, 5.56%, and 5.76% at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The pension liabilities recorded as of
December 31, 2010 represent the unfunded status of these pension plans and were recognized in the statement of financial position as non-current liabilities. Total pension expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008 was approximately $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively. These amounts are not included in the tables above. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has included in AOCI net actuarial gains of $1.1 million ($0.8 million
net of tax) related to non-U.S. pension plans that have yet to be recognized as a reduction to net periodic pension expense and the Company expects its 2011 amortization of the net actuarial gains to be immaterial. The Company’s non-U.S. other
post-retirement benefit obligation is not material as of December 31, 2010.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

Presented below is a summary
of the stock compensation cost and associated tax benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations:

The fair value of each employee stock option award is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted below. The expected dividend yield is derived from the annual dividend rate on the date of grant. The expected stock volatility is based on
an assessment of historical weekly stock prices of the Company as well as implied volatility from Moody’s traded options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. government zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to the expected holding
period. The expected holding period was determined by examining historical and projected post-vesting exercise behavior activity.

The following weighted
average assumptions were used for options granted:

Under the 1998 Plan, 33.0 million shares of the
Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance. The 2001 Plan, which is shareholder approved, permits the granting of up to 35.6 million shares, of which not more than 15.0 million shares are available for grants of awards
other than stock options. The 2001 Plan was amended and approved at the annual shareholders meeting on April 20, 2010, increasing the number of shares reserved for issuance by 7.0 million which are included in the aforementioned amounts.
The Stock Plans provide that options are exercisable not later than ten years from the grant date. The vesting period for awards under the Stock Plans is generally determined by the Board at the date of the grant and has been four years except for
employees who are at or near retirement eligibility, as defined, for which vesting is between one and four years. Additionally, the vesting period for certain performance-based restricted stock, which is described in more detail below, vests after a
three year period. Options may not be granted at less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. The Stock Plans also provide for the granting of restricted stock.

The Company maintains the Directors’ Plan for its Board, which permits the granting of awards in the form of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock or
performance shares. The Directors’ Plan provides that options are exercisable not later than ten years from the grant date. The vesting period is determined by the Board at the date of the grant and is generally one year for options and between
one and three years for restricted stock. Under the Directors’ Plan, 0.8 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. Any director of the Company who is not an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the date
that an award is granted is eligible to participate in the Directors’ Plan.

2010 10-K


During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company granted 0.4 million shares of restricted stock that
contained a condition whereby the number of shares that ultimately vest are based on the achievement of certain non-market based performance metrics of the Company over a three year period. The weighted average grant date fair value of these awards
was $25.33 per share. As of December 31, 2010, there was $7.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to this plan. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years.

The Company has a policy of issuing treasury stock to satisfy shares issued under stock-based compensation plans.

In addition, the Company also sponsors the ESPP. Under the ESPP, 6.0 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. The ESPP allows eligible
employees to purchase common stock of the Company on a monthly basis at a discount to the average of the high and the low trading prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day of each month. This discount was 5% in both 2010 and 2009
and 15% in 2008. The employee purchases are funded through after-tax payroll deductions, which plan participants can elect from one percent to ten percent of compensation, subject to the annual federal limit. In 2008 the Company recorded stock-based
compensation expense for the difference between the purchase price and fair market value under Topic 718 of the ASC. Beginning on January 1, 2009 the discount offered on the ESPP was reduced to 5% resulting in the ESPP qualifying for
non-compensatory status under Topic 718 of the ASC. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for the ESPP in 2010 and 2009.

Prepaid taxes of $82.3 million and $18.6 million for December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively are included
in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately $758.1 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that it intends to indefinitely reinvest in foreign operations.
The Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. It is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future, due
to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.

The Company had valuation allowances of $12.8 million
and $4.5 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to foreign net operating losses for which realization is uncertain. The change in the valuation allowances for 2010 and 2009 results primarily from the increase in valuation
allowances in certain jurisdictions based on the Company’s evaluation of the expected realization of these future benefits.

As of December 31,
2010 the Company had $180.8 million of UTPs of which $138.3 million represents the amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of UTPs is as follows:

The Company classifies interest related to UTPs in interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties, if
incurred, would be recognized in other non-operating expenses. During 2010, the amount of net interest accrued for UTPs was $5.9 million. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 the amount of accrued interest recorded in the Company’s balance
sheets related to UTPs was $33.7 million and $27.7 million, respectively.

tax as well as income tax in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. Moody’s U.S. federal tax returns filed for the years 2007 through 2009 remain subject to examination by the IRS. The Company’s tax filings in New York State for
the years 2004 through 2007 are currently under examination. The income tax returns for 2008 and 2009 remain open to examination for both New York State and New York City. Tax filings in the U.K. for 2006 are currently under examination by the U.K.
taxing authorities and for 2007 to 2009 remain open to examination.

For current ongoing audits related to open tax years the Company estimates that it
is possible that the balance of UTPs could decrease in the next twelve months as a result of the effective settlement of these audits, which might involve the payment of additional taxes, the adjustment of certain deferred taxes and/or the
recognition of tax benefits. It is also possible that new issues might be raised by tax authorities which might necessitate increases to the balance of UTPs. As the Company is unable to predict the timing of conclusion of these audits, the Company
is unable to estimate the amount of changes to the balance of UTPs at this time. However, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for its financial exposure for all open tax years by tax jurisdiction. Additionally, the Company is
seeking tax rulings on certain tax positions which, if granted, could decrease the balance of UTPs over the next twelve months however, due to the uncertainty involved with this process, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of changes to the
balance of UTPs at this time.

NOTE


INDEBTEDNESS

The following table summarizes total
indebtedness:

2007 Facility

On
September 28, 2007, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility, expiring in September 2012. The 2007 Facility will serve, in part, to support the Company’s CP Program described below.
Interest on borrowings is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium that can range from 16.0 to 40.0 basis points of the outstanding borrowing amount depending on the Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees,
regardless of borrowing activity under the 2007 Facility. The quarterly fees for the 2007 Facility can range from 4.0 to 10.0 basis points per annum of the facility amount, depending on the Company’s Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also
pays a utilization fee of 5.0 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding exceeds 50% of the total facility. The 2007 Facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the
Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreement. The
2007 Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter.

Commercial Paper

On October 3, 2007, the Company entered into a private placement commercial paper
program under which the Company may issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The CP Program is supported by the Company’s 2007 Facility. The maturities of the CP Notes
will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The CP Notes are sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The rates of
interest will depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) certificate of deposit rate; (b) commercial paper rate; (c) the federal funds rate;
(d) the LIBOR; (e) prime rate; (f) Treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement to the private placement agreement. The weighted average interest rate on CP borrowings outstanding was 0.3% as of
December 31, 2009. The CP Program contains certain events of default including, among other things: non-payment of principal, interest or fees; entrance into any form of moratorium; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain
instances to cure periods.

Notes Payable

On
August 19, 2010, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a public offering. The 2010 Senior Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% and mature on September 1, 2020. Interest on the 2010
Senior Notes will be due semi-annually on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2011. The Company may prepay the 2010 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make Whole Amount. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the notes, the Company may be required to purchase all or a portion of the notes upon occurrence of a “Change of Control
Triggering Event,” as defined in the Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the Indenture contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company to consolidate or merge with another
entity or to sell all or substantially all of its assets to another entity. The Indenture contains customary default provisions. In


MOODY’S

2010 10-K


addition, an event of default will occur if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fail to pay the principal of any indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture) when due at maturity in an
aggregate amount of $50 million or more, or a default occurs that results in the acceleration of the maturity of the Company’s or certain of its subsidiaries’ indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more. Upon the occurrence
and during the continuation of an event of default under the Indenture, the notes may become immediately due and payable either automatically or by the vote of the holders of more than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the notes then
outstanding.

On September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount
of its 6.06% Series 2007-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 pursuant to the 2007 Agreement. The Series 2007-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 6.06%, payable semi-annually on March 7 and
September 7. Under the terms of the 2007 Agreement, the Company may, from time to time within five years, in its sole discretion, issue additional series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million pursuant to one
or more supplements to the 2007 Agreement. The Company may prepay the Series 2007-1 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make Whole
Amount. The 2007 Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: enter into transactions with affiliates, dispose of assets, incur or create liens, enter into any
sale-leaseback transactions, or merge with any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. The Company must also not permit its Debt/EBITDA ratio to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter.

On September 30, 2005, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Series
2005-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2015 pursuant to the 2005 Agreement. The Series 2005-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30. Proceeds from the sale of
the Series 2005-1 Notes were used to refinance $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s outstanding 7.61% senior notes which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moody’s pays all, or part, of the Series
2005-1 Notes in advance of their maturity, such prepayment will be subject to a Make Whole Amount. The Series 2005-1 Notes are subject to certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements.

2008 Term Loan

On May 7, 2008, Moody’s entered
into a five-year, $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan with several lenders. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay off a portion of the CP outstanding. Interest on borrowings under the 2008 Term Loan is payable quarterly at rates that are
based on LIBOR plus a margin that can range from 125 basis points to 175 basis points depending on the Company’s Debt/EBITDA ratio. The outstanding borrowings shall amortize beginning in 2010 in accordance with the schedule of payments set
forth in the 2008 Term Loan outlined in the table below.

The 2008 Term Loan contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict the
ability of the Company to engage or to permit its subsidiaries to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur, or permit its subsidiaries to incur, liens, in each case,
subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The 2008 Term Loan also limits the amount of debt that subsidiaries of the Company may incur. In addition, the 2008 Term Loan contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a
Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter.

The principal payments due on the Company’s long-term borrowings for
each of the next five years are presented in the table below:

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300 million which will
convert the fixed rate of interest on the Series 2005-1 Notes to a floating LIBOR-based interest rate. Also, on May 7, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150 million to protect against
fluctuations in the LIBOR-based variable interest rate on the 2008 Term Loan. Both of these interest rate swaps are more fully discussed in Note 5 above.

INTEREST (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET

The following table summarizes the components of interest as presented in the consolidated statements of operations:

(a)

Represents a reduction of accrued interest related to the favorable resolution of Legacy Tax Matters, further discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

Net interest expense of $33.4 million in 2009 reflects a reduction of approximately $12 million related to tax and tax-related
liabilities.

At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. In addition to the
covenants described above, the 2007 Facility, the 2005 Agreement, the 2007 Agreement, the 2010 Senior Notes and the 2008 Term Loan contain cross default provisions whereby default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit
lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable.

The Company’s
long-term debt, including the current portion, is recorded at cost except for the Series 2005-1 Notes which are carried at cost net of the fair value of an interest rate swap used to hedge the fair value of the note. The fair value and carrying
value of the Company’s long-term debt as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows:

The fair value of the Company’s 2010 Senior Notes is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the remaining long-term
debt, which is not publicly traded, is estimated using discounted cash flows based on prevailing interest rates available to the Company for borrowings with similar maturities.

NOTE 15

CAPITAL STOCK

Authorized Capital Stock

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Company has authority to issue under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation is 1.02 billion shares
with a par value of $0.01, of which 1.0 billion are shares of common stock, 10.0 million are shares of preferred stock and 10.0 million are shares of series common stock. The preferred stock and series common stock can be issued with
varying terms, as determined by the Board.

Rights Agreement

The Company had a rights agreement, which expired as of June 30, 2008 and was not renewed. The rights agreement was designed to protect its shareholders in the event of unsolicited offers to acquire the
Company and coercive takeover tactics that, in the opinion of the Board, could impair its ability to represent shareholder interests.

Share
Repurchase Program

The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5-1
program. Systematic share repurchases are initiated at management’s discretion. Moody’s may also purchase opportunistically when conditions


MOODY’S

2010 10-K


warrant. On June 5, 2006, the Board authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which the Company completed during January 2008. On July 30, 2007, the Board of the Company
authorized an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which the Company began utilizing in January 2008 after completing the June 2006 authorization. There is no established expiration date for the remaining authorization. The
Company’s intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves their long-term interests. As a result, Moody’s share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter.

During 2010, Moody’s repurchased 8.6 million shares of its common stock, under the aforementioned July 30, 2007 authorization and issued 2.7 million
shares under employee stock-based compensation plans.

Dividends

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.105, $0.10 and $0.10 per share of Moody’s common stock in each of the quarters, resulting in dividends paid per share during the years
ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $0.42, $0.40 and $0.40, respectively.

On December 14, 2010, the Board of the Company approved the
declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share of Moody’s common stock, payable on March 10, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2011. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted
above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board.

NOTE 16

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Moody’s operates its business from
various leased facilities, which are under operating leases that expire over the next 17 years. Moody’s also leases certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next four years. Rent expense, including lease
incentives, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the related lease term. Rent expense under operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $70.9 million, $74.3 million and $64.4 million, respectively. The total
amount of deferred rent that is included in other liabilities and accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets is $103.1 million and $90.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company had $4.8
million of computer equipment subject to capital lease obligations at December 31, 2009, with accumulated amortization of $4.3 million. There were no assets subject to capital lease obligations at December 31, 2010.

The approximate minimum rent for operating leases that have remaining or original noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2010 is as
follows:

On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into a 21-year operating lease agreement to occupy 15 floors of an office building at
7WTC which includes a total of 20 years of renewal options. On March 28, 2007 the 7WTC lease agreement was amended for the Company to lease an additional two floors for a term of 20 years. The total base rent for the entire lease term,
including rent credits, for the 7WTC lease is approximately $642 million.

On February 6, 2008, the Company entered into a 17.5 year operating lease
agreement to occupy six floors of an office tower located in the Canary Wharf district of London, England. The total base rent of the Canary Wharf Lease over its 17.5-year term is approximately 134 million GBP, and the Company will begin making
base rent payments in 2011. In addition to the base rent payments the Company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for its share of operating expenses and tax obligation.

NOTE


CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, Moody’s is involved in
legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal
course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to
SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

Following the events in the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly over the
last several years, MIS and other credit rating agencies are the subject of intense scrutiny, increased regulation, ongoing investigation, and civil litigation. Legislative, regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering
additional legislation, regulation and enforcement actions, including with respect to MIS’s compliance with newly imposed regulatory standards. Moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other
governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries.

In addition, the Company is facing litigation from market participants
relating to the performance of MIS rated securities. Although Moody’s in the normal course experiences such litigation, the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased in the current economic environment.

On June 27, 2008, the Brockton Contributory Retirement System, a purported shareholder of the Company’s securities, filed a purported
shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. The plaintiff asserts various
causes of action relating to the named defendants’ oversight of MIS’s ratings of RMBS and constant-proportion debt obligations, and their participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about
MIS’s ratings practices and/or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement of profits and other equitable relief. On July 2,
2008, Thomas R. Flynn, a purported shareholder of the Company’s securities, filed a similar purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the Company as nominal
defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, asserting similar claims and seeking the same relief. The cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in November 2008. The Company
removed the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in December 2008. In January 2009, the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to the Supreme Court of the State of New York, which the Company
opposed. On February 23, 2010, the court issued an opinion remanding the case to the Supreme Court of New York. On October 30, 2008, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System, a purported shareholder of the Company’s
securities, also filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. This complaint
also asserts various causes of action relating to the Company’s ratings of RMBS, CDO and constant-proportion debt obligations, and named defendants’ participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information
about MIS’s ratings practices and/or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. On December 9, 2008, Rena Nadoff, a purported shareholder of the Company, filed a shareholder derivative
complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and its CEO, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged
overrating of asset-backed securities and underrating of municipal securities. On October 20, 2009, the Company moved to dismiss or stay the action in favor of related federal litigation. On January 26, 2010, the court entered a
stipulation and order, submitted jointly by the parties, staying the Nadoff litigation pending coordination and prosecution of similar claims in the above and below described federal derivative actions. On July 6, 2009, W. A. Sokolowski, a
purported shareholder of the Company, filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and current and former officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts claims relating to alleged mismanagement of the Company’s processes for rating structured finance transactions, alleged insider trading and causing the Company to buy back its own stock
at artificially inflated prices.

Two purported class action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the Company’s securities against
the Company and certain of its senior officers, asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The first was filed by Raphael Nach in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 19, 2007. The second was filed by
Teamsters Local 282 Pension Trust Fund in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 26, 2007. Both actions have been consolidated into a single proceeding entitled In re Moody’s Corporation Securities
Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 27, 2008, a consolidated amended complaint was filed, purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities during the period
February 3, 2006 through October 24, 2007. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false and/or misleading statements concerning the Company’s business conduct, business prospects, business conditions and financial results
relating primarily to MIS’s ratings of structured finance products including RMBS, CDO and constant-proportion debt obligations. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the case. The Company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in September 2008. On February 23, 2009, the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims and sustaining others.

Moody’s Analytics is cooperating with an investigation by the SEC concerning services provided by that unit to certain financial institutions in connection
with the valuations used by those institutions with respect to certain financial instruments held by such institutions.

For claims, litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability is
expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related
to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such
matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties
assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the
impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve the pending matters referred to above
progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the inherent
uncertainties involved in these matters, the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them and the novel theories of law asserted, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time. For income tax matters, the Company
employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its
technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized
at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

Legacy
Tax Matters

Moody’s continues to have exposure to potential liabilities arising from Legacy Tax Matters. As of December 31, 2010,
Moody’s has recorded liabilities for Legacy Tax Matters totaling $59.3 million. This includes liabilities and accrued interest due to New D&B arising from the 2000 Distribution Agreement. It is possible that the ultimate liability for
Legacy Tax Matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moody’s future reported results, financial position and cash flows.

The following summary of the relationships among Moody’s, New D&B and their predecessor entities is important in understanding the Company’s exposure
to the Legacy Tax Matters.

In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into three separate public companies: The
Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation and Cognizant Corporation. In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into two separate public companies: Old D&B and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998,
Cognizant separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. In September 2000, Old D&B separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moody’s.

Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business. These initiatives are subject to normal review by
tax authorities. Old D&B and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable IRS determinations on certain tax matters, and
certain other potential tax liabilities, all as described in such agreements. Further, in connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moody’s have agreed on the financial
responsibility for any potential liabilities related to these Legacy Tax Matters.

At the time of the 2000 Distribution, New D&B paid Moody’s
$55.0 million for 50% of certain anticipated future tax benefits through 2012. In the event that these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by New D&B, or there is an IRS audit of New D&B impacting these tax benefits,
Moody’s would be required to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits as well as its share of any tax liability incurred by New D&B. As of December 31, 2010,
Moody’s liability with respect to this matter totaled $57.3 million. In 2008, as part of this matter, and due to a statute of limitations expiration, Moody’s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of $2.3 million ($1.4 million,
net of tax) and an increase in other non-operating income of $6.4 million relating to amounts due to New D&B.

In 2005, settlement agreements were
executed with the IRS with respect to certain Legacy Tax Matters related to the years 1989-1990 and 1993-1996. With respect to these settlements, Moody’s and New D&B believed that IMS Health and NMR did not pay their full share of the
liability to the IRS under the terms of the applicable separation agreements between the parties. Moody’s and New D&B subsequently paid these amounts to the IRS and commenced arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to resolve
this dispute. This resulted in settlement payments to Moody’s of $6.7 million ($6.1 million as a reduction of interest expense and $0.6 million as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense) in 2008 and $10.8 million ($6.5
million as a reduction of interest expense

and $4.3 million as a reduction of tax expense) in 2009. The aforementioned settlement payments resulted in net income benefits of $4 million and $8.2 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The
Company continues to carry a $2 million liability for this matter.

In 2006, New D&B and Moody’s each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS
in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. In 2007, New D&B and Moody’s requested a return of that deposit. The IRS applied a portion of the deposit in
satisfaction of an assessed deficiency and returned the balance to the Company. Moody’s subsequently pursued a refund for a portion of the outstanding amount. In May 2010, the IRS refunded $5.2 million to the Company for the 1997 tax year,
which included interest of approximately $2.5 million resulting in an after-tax benefit of $4.6 million.

NOTE


SEGMENT INFORMATION

Beginning in January 2008, Moody’s
segments were changed to reflect the business Reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the Reorganization, the rating agency is reported in the MIS segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moody’s
other non-rating commercial activities are reported in the MA segment. As a result, the Company began operating in two reportable segments beginning in January 2008.

Revenue for MIS and expenses for MA include an intersegment royalty charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate
expenses of the Company, all of which were previously included in the former MIS segment, are allocated to each new segment based on a revenue-split methodology. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and
support staff such as finance, human resource, information technology and legal. “Eliminations” in the table below represents intersegment royalty revenue/expense. Below is financial information by segment, MIS and MA revenue by LOB and
consolidated information by geographic area and total assets by segment. The effects of the change in the composition of reportable segments have been reflected throughout the accompanying financial statements.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY SEGMENT:

The cumulative restructuring charges from inception through December 31, 2010 incurred for both the 2007 and 2009 Restructuring
Plans, which are further discussed in Note 10 above, are $48.9 million and $16.2 million for the MIS and MA operating segments, respectively.

MIS
AND MA REVENUE BY LINE OF BUSINESS

As part of the Reorganization there were several realignments within the MIS LOB as follows: Sovereign and
sub-sovereign ratings, which were previously part of financial institutions; infrastructure/utilities ratings, which were previously part of CFG; and project

finance, which was previously part of structured finance, were combined with the public finance business to form a new LOB called public, project and infrastructure finance or PPIF. In addition,
real estate investment trust ratings were moved from FIG and CFG to the SFG business. Furthermore, in August 2008, the global managed investments ratings group which was previously part of SFG, was moved to the FIG business.

Within MA, various aspects of the legacy MIS research business and MKMV business were combined in 2008 to form the subscriptions, software and professional services
LOB. The subscriptions business included credit and economic research, data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis; the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk software products; and the
professional services business included risk modeling, credit scorecard development, and other specialized analytical projects, as well as credit education services that are typically sold on a per-engagement basis.

In 2009, the aforementioned MA businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the MA segment at December 31, 2009. Pursuant
to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed RD&A and the software business was renamed RMS. The revised groupings classify certain subscription-based risk management software revenue and advisory services relating to software
sales to the redefined RMS business.

The tables below present revenue by LOB within each new segment and reflects the related intra-segment realignment:

net income related to the resolution of Legacy Tax Matters for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, respectively. Additionally, there was a tax benefit of approximately $17.6 million during the three months ended
