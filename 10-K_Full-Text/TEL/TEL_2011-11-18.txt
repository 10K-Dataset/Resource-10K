PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity," or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global company
that designs and manufactures approximately 500,000 products that connect and protect the flow of power and data inside millions of products used by consumers and industries. We partner with customers
in a broad array of industries from consumer electronics, energy, and healthcare to automotive, aerospace, and communication networks.

In
March 2011, our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of association to change our name from "Tyco Electronics Ltd." to "TE Connectivity Ltd." The name
change was effective March 10, 2011. Our ticker symbol "TEL" on the New York Stock Exchange remained unchanged.

Tyco
Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of then Bermuda-based Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International").
Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of our shares to its common shareholders (referred to in this report as the "separation"). We became an independent, publicly traded
company owning the former electronics businesses of Tyco International.

Our
business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions, from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2002, of established electronics companies and divisions, including the acquisition
of AMP Incorporated and Raychem Corporation in fiscal 1999, and the Electromechanical Components Division of Siemens and OEM Division of Thomas & Betts in fiscal 2000. These companies each had
more than 50 years of history in engineering and innovation excellence. We operated as a segment of Tyco International prior to our separation.

Effective
June 25, 2009, we discontinued our existence as a Bermuda company as provided in Section 132G of the Companies Act of 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the "Bermuda
Companies Act"), and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued our existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of
the Swiss Code of Obligations. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

We
operate through three reporting segments: Transportation Solutions, Communications and Industrial Solutions, and Network Solutions. See Notes 1 and 23 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments.



Our
reporting segments manufacture and distribute our products and solutions to a number of end markets. The table below provides a summary of our reporting segments, the fiscal 2011 net
sales contribution of each segment, and the key products and industry end markets that we serve:

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

•

Portfolio of market-leading connectivity businesses.

We
are leaders in many of the markets we serve, and the opportunity for growth in those markets is significant. We believe our three segments serve a combined approximately $90 billion market that
is expected to grow at an estimated annual growth rate of 6% over the next five years.

•

Global leader in passive components.

With net sales of
$14.3 billion in fiscal 2011, we are significantly larger than many of our competitors. In the fragmented connector industry, which we estimated to be approximately $48 billion in fiscal
2011, our net sales were approximately $8.5 billion. We have established a global leadership position in the connector industry with leading market positions in the following
markets:

•

Automotive—#1

•

Industrial—#1

•

Telecom/data communications—#2

•

Computers and peripherals—#3

Our
scale provides us the opportunity to accelerate our sales growth by making larger investments in existing and new technologies in our core markets and to expand our presence in emerging markets.
Our leadership position also provides us the opportunity to lower our purchasing costs by developing lower cost sources of supply and to maintain a flexible manufacturing footprint worldwide that is
close to our customers' locations.

•

Strong customer relationships.

As an industry leader, we
have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical
solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we are able



to
identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products.

•

Process and product technology leadership.

We employ
approximately 7,500 engineers dedicated to product research, development, and engineering. Our investment of $733 million in product and process engineering and development together with our
capital spending of $581 million in fiscal 2011 enable us to consistently provide innovative, high-quality products with efficient manufacturing methods.

•

Diverse product mix and customer base.

We manufacture and
sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back
many years. We believe that this diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to particular end markets, thereby
reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our
competitors.

•

Global presence.

We have an established manufacturing
presence in over 20 countries and our sales are global. Our global coverage positions us near our customers' locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering
their production costs. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.

•

Strong management team and employee base.

We believe our
management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our Chief Executive Officer and segment leaders average more than
25 years of experience, of which most is in the electronics industry. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team that is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our
position as a global leader in the industry.

We
have approximately 95,000 employees who are based throughout the world. We continue to emphasize employee development and training, and we embrace diversity. Our strong employee base, along with
their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company's success.

Our Strategy

We want to be a premier partner to our customers; we want our employees to thrive, be highly engaged, and view our company as a great
place to work; and we want to generate superior returns for our shareholders. These three basic tenets are the focus of our strategy and drive all that we do. Our strategy is built on core values of
integrity, accountability, teamwork, and innovation. We expect our employees to do the right thing, take responsibility, work together, and innovate.

Our
goal is to be the world leader in providing custom-engineered electronic components and solutions for an increasingly connected world. We believe that in achieving this, we will
increase net sales and profitability across our segments in the markets that we serve. We intend to continue our growth by focusing on the following priorities:

•

Deliver extraordinary customer service.

We are broadening
the concept of service to embrace every aspect of how we reach and serve our customers. We are increasing our focus on our strategic accounts through direct sales, better leveraging the distribution
channel, and revolutionizing our web presence and eBusiness programs. These initiatives, along with our company-wide improvement program designed to improve productivity, reduce costs, and
ultimately deliver greater satisfaction to our customers and greater value to shareholders, will



enable
us to broaden our customer reach and increase customer satisfaction while enabling us to serve customers better and more cost effectively.

•

Strengthen our innovation leadership.

Technology
leadership is critical to our business. We seek to continue to strengthen our process and product technology leadership and to increase the percentage of our annual net sales from new products. In
fiscal 2011, we derived approximately 25% of our net sales from new products launched within the previous three years. We intend to continue to focus our research, development, and engineering
investment on next generation technologies and highly engineered products and platforms, and leverage innovation across our segments.

•

Extend our leadership in emerging markets.

We seek to
improve our market leadership position in emerging geographic regions, including China, Eastern Europe, Brazil, and India, which we expect will experience higher growth rates than those of more
developed regions in the world. In fiscal 2011, we generated $2.1 billion of net sales in China, $1.1 billion of net sales in Eastern Europe, $0.4 billion of net sales in Brazil,
and $0.2 billion of net sales in India. We believe that expansion in these regions will enable us to grow faster than the overall global market.

•

Lead in smart connectivity.

Smart connectivity
complements and expands on innovation leadership. It adds more functionality and intelligence wherever connectivity occurs. Our focus on smart connectivity enables us to provide more value to our
customers by offering products that do more and solve more.

•

Supplement organic growth with strategic partnerships and
acquisitions.

We will evaluate and selectively pursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions that strengthen our market position,
enhance our existing product offering, enable us to enter attractive markets, expand our technological capabilities, and provide synergy opportunities.

Raw Materials

We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic
resins for molding, precious metals such as gold and silver for plating, and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used
for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The
prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand dynamics.



The
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from
the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo ("DRC"). As a result, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") is required to establish new annual disclosure and reporting requirements
for those companies who use "conflict" minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. When these new requirements are implemented, they could affect the sourcing and
availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals.

Research and Development

We are engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the
effectiveness, ease of use, safety, and reliability of our existing products, and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate. We continually evaluate developing
technologies in areas where we may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition.

Our research, development, and engineering efforts are supported by approximately 7,500 engineers. These engineers work closely with our customers
to develop application specific, highly engineered products and systems to satisfy the customers' needs. Our new products, including product extensions, introduced during the previous three years
comprised approximately 25% of our net sales for fiscal 2011.

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution

We sell our products into more than 150 countries, and we sell primarily through direct selling efforts. We also sell some of our
products indirectly via third-party distributors. In
fiscal 2011, our direct sales represented 78% of net sales, with the remainder of net sales provided by sales to third-party distributors and independent manufacturer representatives.

We
maintain distribution centers around the world. Products are generally delivered to these distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the
customer. In some instances, product is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products via road, rail,
sea, and air.

Seasonality and Backlog

Customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business conditions and because unfilled orders may be canceled
prior to shipment of goods. We experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. The third fiscal quarter is typically the strongest quarter of our fiscal year, while the first fiscal quarter is
negatively affected by winter holidays and the fourth fiscal quarter is negatively affected by European holidays. The second fiscal quarter may also be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in
certain of our end markets.

know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents
and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and
monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We
own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents
and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent
protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

While
we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by
any single patent or group of related patents.

Employees

As of September 30, 2011, we employed approximately 95,000 people worldwide, of whom 29,000 were in the Americas region, 26,000
were in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, and 40,000 were in



the
Asia-Pacific region. Of our total employees, approximately 58,000 were employed in manufacturing. Approximately 65% of our employees were based in lower-cost countries,
primarily China. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the United States and other countries. A small portion of our products,
including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and
other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import
and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

Environmental

Our operations are subject to numerous health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations that have
been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the
protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards, staff dedicated to environmental,
health, and safety issues, periodic compliance auditing, training, and other measures. We have a program for compliance with the European Union ("EU") Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste
Electrical and Electronics Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, and similar laws.

Compliance
with these laws has in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways. For example, our costs may increase indirectly through
increased energy and product costs as producers of energy, cement, iron, steel, pulp, paper, petroleum, and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to increased or new regulation or
legislation that results in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate
environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, current information, and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the
range of approximately $12 million to $24 million. As of September 30, 2011, we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately $13 million. We do not
anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks described
below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to risks that affect many other companies, such as general economic conditions, geopolitical events, competition, technological
obsolescence, labor relations, natural disasters, and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Risks Relating to Our Business

Conditions in global or regional economies, capital and money markets, and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or worldwide, including
the cost and availability of consumer and business credit, end demand from consumer and industrial markets, and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on
sovereign debt, any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow, and ability to obtain financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may
delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full. Further, our vendors may experience similar problems, which may
impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels. If regional or global economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows could be materially adversely affected.

We
are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets. For example, the
automotive industry, which accounted for approximately 34% of our net sales in fiscal 2011, has experienced a significant downturn in recent years as described below. The telecommunications industry,
which accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2011, has historically experienced periods of robust capital expenditure followed by periods of retrenchment and consolidation. The
aerospace, defense, and marine industry, which accounted for 5% of our net sales in fiscal 2011, has undergone significant fluctuations in demand, depending on worldwide economic and political
conditions. Periodic downturns in our customers' industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products,
which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are dependent on the automotive industry which has experienced significant declines in recent years.

Approximately 34% of our net sales for fiscal 2011 were to customers in the automotive industry. In recent years, automotive
manufacturers globally have experienced lower levels of vehicle sales as a result of the 2009 economic downturn and credit conditions. Fiscal 2009 and 2010 sales levels were below fiscal 2008 levels.
In fiscal 2011, sales increased and improved relative to prior years to reach fiscal 2008 levels. Additionally, the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant
price pressure on their suppliers. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by changes
in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as well as potential consolidations among
automotive manufacturers.

We are dependent on the telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics industries.

Approximately 14% of our net sales for fiscal 2011 came from sales to the telecommunications industry. Demand for these products is
subject to rapid technological change, and was and remains



affected
by declines in consumer and business spending. Additionally, these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the telecommunications industry, and our inability to do so would materially impair our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows.

Approximately
8% of our net sales for fiscal 2011 came from sales to the computer and consumer electronics industries. Demand for our computer and consumer electronics products depends
on underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products, as well as the market share of our customers. Demand was and remains affected by reduced spending. We cannot
assure you that existing levels of business and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products will not decrease.

We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry.

We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components, and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will
increase in the future. Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price, quality, and performance of our products, the level of customer service, the development of
new technology, and our ability to participate in emerging markets. The competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to
small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has continued to become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years, and our major competitors have significant
financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products. We
cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. Increased competition may result in price
reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue.

Substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences,
which are rapid in certain end markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products, to modify existing
products, and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate
the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands.

Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices.

We have historically experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, continuing pressure to lower our prices. In recent years, we
have experienced price erosion averaging from 1% to 2%. In order to maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot assure you that continuing pressures to
reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.

We are a large buyer of resin, copper, gold, silver, brass, steel, chemicals and additives, zinc, and other precious metals. Many of
these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries



around
the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, the price of many of these raw materials, including gold and copper, has increased in recent years and continues
to fluctuate. Gold has recently traded at an all-time high. In recent years, we have only been able to partially offset these increases through higher selling prices. Our results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or
there are continued significant price increases for these raw materials. Any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and, to the extent we cannot
compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial position, and
cash flows. In addition, we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices. The success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of
the hedged commodity materials. We could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate.

The
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from
the conflict zones of the DRC. As a result, the SEC is required to establish new annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use "conflict" minerals mined from the DRC and
adjoining countries in their products. When these new requirements are implemented, they could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a
result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive
prices. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used
in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement.

Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and
revenue. Approximately 55% of our net sales for fiscal 2011 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, and we expect non-U.S. Dollar revenue to represent a significant and
likely increased portion of our future net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the Euro or Asian
currencies, our U.S. Dollar reported
revenue and income will decrease. Changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We manage this risk in
part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by the counterparty to these contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be
successful.

We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate.

Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become more
concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, telecommunications, computer, and aerospace, defense, and marine industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases
from us. In addition, as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, and they have been able to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from
which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our products, particularly for
commodity components.



The life cycles of our products can be very short.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle. As a result, the resources devoted to
product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue, and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering
expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows would be materially and adversely affected.

The ADC Telecommunications, Inc. acquisition and future acquisitions may not be successful.

In December 2010, we acquired ADC Telecommunications, Inc. ("ADC"), and we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of
strategic businesses, product lines, or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings. Risks associated with the completed
acquisition of ADC include the risk that we do not fully integrate
ADC successfully and the risk that revenue opportunities, cost savings, and other anticipated synergies from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected. We
also cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with other acquisition candidates in the future. Nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be
successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could
be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity.

If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks,
public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other
leverage measures. We cannot assure you that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to undertake an acquisition partially or
wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares.

We could suffer significant business interruptions.

Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chain that supports their operations may be vulnerable to
interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, or floods, or other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war, disease, or failures of management
information or other systems due to internal or external causes. If a business interruption occurs, our business, financial position, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

On
March 11, 2011, an earthquake occurred near the northeastern coast of Japan creating a tsunami that caused extensive damage. Our facilities in Japan were not materially
damaged; however, there were disruptions in our customers' operations in Japan as well as in the supply chain that supports their operations. As a result, we experienced a negative impact on our sales
and operations in fiscal 2011. We estimate that sales and diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by $99 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2011. There can be no
assurance that the long-term consequence of the disaster will not adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.



Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.

Our success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees at our operations around the world. We depend on highly
skilled technical personnel to design, manufacture, and support our wide range of electronic components. Additionally, we rely upon experienced managerial, marketing, and support personnel to manage
our business effectively and to successfully promote our wide range of products. Any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the necessary global management, technical, human resource, and financial
skills to achieve our objectives may have adverse affects on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We may use components and products manufactured by third parties.

We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to
manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality
control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. We also have third-party arrangements for the manufacture of certain products, parts, and components. If these
third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our
commercial reputation could be damaged.

Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology.

The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry,
companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or
invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will choose not to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product,
patent, trademark, or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows.

A decline in the market value of our pension plans' investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could adversely affect our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with concerns about credit, inflation, or deflation, have caused and could
continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities, including fixed income and equity, which has and could further reduce the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios. In
addition, the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved. A decrease in the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding.

The global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of
investment capital and credit. Recent downgrades of credit ratings of sovereign debt, including the U.S., has similarly affected the availability and cost of capital. As a result, we may be unable to
access adequate funding to operate and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and
capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors,



including
our operating cash flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and
business conditions.

Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

While we have completed the divestiture of underperforming or non-strategic businesses and product lines that we began over
four years ago, we continue to evaluate specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those
related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including
difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other
business concerns, the disruption of our business, and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks
encountered.

Recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill could negatively affect our results of operations.

We test goodwill allocated to reporting units for impairment annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if events
occur or circumstances exist that indicate that a reporting unit's carrying value may exceed its fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and
determined that no impairment existed. Significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of reporting unit
specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's
judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill. Should economic conditions further deteriorate or remain depressed, estimates of future cash flows for our reporting units
may be insufficient to support carrying value and the goodwill assigned to it, requiring us to test for impairment. Impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and
financial position.

If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations, our business may suffer.

Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in
particular the United States and the European Union. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial, including distribution, agreements and
practices with respect to the electrical components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We also may be subject to third party
claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and
enforceable. If we are unable to enforce any of our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely
affected. Further, any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction, which
could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.



We are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability.

Our workforce, manufacturing, research, administrative, and sales facilities, markets, customers, and suppliers are located throughout
the world, and we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:

•

tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes;

•

regulations related to customs and import/export matters;

•

variations in lengths of payment cycles;

•

tax issues, such as tax law changes, examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country,
and difficulties in repatriating in a tax-efficient manner cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions;

•

challenges in collecting accounts receivable;

•

employment regulations and local labor conditions;

•

difficulties protecting intellectual property;

•

instability in economic or political conditions, including sovereign debt levels, inflation, recession, and actual or
anticipated military or political conflicts; and

•

the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

We
have sizeable operations in China, including 17 manufacturing sites. In addition, 15% of our net sales in fiscal 2011 were made to customers in China. The legal system in China is
still developing and is subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for products in China could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of Chinese law.

In
addition, Standard & Poor's recent credit rating downgrade of long-term U.S. sovereign debt, any future downgrade by other rating agencies of long-term
U.S. sovereign debt, or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions, which could negatively affect our business,
financial condition and liquidity.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery
laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery
laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance
with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with
anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always
will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, and violations.

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various
countries where we operate governing, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;



•

investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites;

•

greenhouse gas emissions; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

We
may not have been, or we may not at all times be, in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or
otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or
materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal, and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws are
retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or
exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerly owned
sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for
the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites.

While
we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future
environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect
our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present,
or future business activities.

Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, and recycling.

The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing
environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other
related matters. These laws include the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the EU REACH (chemical registration)
Directive, the China law on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution by Electronic Information Products, and various other laws. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the
manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. These
laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make manufacture or sale
of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.

We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and
cash flows.

In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual
property rights, anti-competitive behavior, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust



laws
permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In
addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt (as defined in the credit
facility) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (as defined in the credit facility) and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding
notes indentures contain customary covenants including
limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate, merge, and sell assets.

Although
none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our continued ability to meet the bank credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond
our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures. Upon
the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our
lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will
have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of
any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder.

The
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available or access to
funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change
of control triggering event.

Risks Relating to Our Separation from Tyco International

We share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date.

In connection with our separation from Tyco International in 2007, we, Tyco International, and its former healthcare businesses
("Covidien") entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement pursuant to which we share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula
for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from
adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to
intercompany transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation. All costs and
expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax
Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.



All
the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses, including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from Tyco International, became our tax liabilities. Although we
agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco
International and Covidien default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such
liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Tyco
International's, and Covidien's tax liabilities.

Our,
Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax
adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740,

Income Taxes

, have been
reflected as liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for
uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for
issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest
are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the
ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International has the right to administer, control, and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.
The timing, nature, and amount
of any settlement agreed to by Tyco International may not be in our best interests. Moreover, the other parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement will be able to remove Tyco International as the
controlling party only under limited circumstances, including a change of control or bankruptcy of Tyco International, or by a majority vote of the parties on or after the second anniversary of the
distribution. All other tax audits will be administered, controlled, and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax.

In
September 2011, Tyco International announced its intention to spin-off two of its businesses to its shareholders, with Tyco International remaining as a publicly-traded
company. Although these transactions are in preliminary stages, we expect that Tyco International will continue to meet its legal obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement.

If the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could
incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

Tyco International received private letter rulings from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution
of our common shares and Covidien common shares to the Tyco International shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution, except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of our
common shares and the Covidien common shares, will qualify as



tax-free
under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). The private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in
anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the private letter rulings, Tyco International obtained opinions from outside legal
counsel confirming the tax-free status of the distribution and certain internal transactions. The private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions, and
certain representations and undertakings, from us, Tyco International, and Covidien regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the private
letter rulings and the opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts,
assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in
stock or asset ownership after the distribution. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, Tyco International would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market
value of our common shares and Covidien common shares distributed to Tyco International shareholders on the distribution date over Tyco International's tax basis in such common shares, but such gain,
if recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, we would incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal
transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable transactions.

In
addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result
of actions taken after the distribution by us, Tyco International, or Covidien, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us, Tyco International, or Covidien
as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us, Tyco International, or Covidien, then we, Tyco International, or Covidien would be
responsible for 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on us, Tyco International, or Covidien as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. In the event that
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be
responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party's obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party's taxes.

Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation

Legislative and other proposals in Switzerland, the United States, and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate.

Various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at companies incorporated in
lower-tax jurisdictions. We believe that recently there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and other initiatives as various jurisdictions look for solutions to
fiscal deficits. If adopted, these proposed changes could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or
initiatives, and we cannot assure you that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us.

Legislation in the United States could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our
business by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions.

We
expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that
have corporate



locations
abroad. We believe that we are less likely to be subject to such proposals since becoming a Swiss corporation in June 2009. However, we cannot predict the likelihood that, or final form in
which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased regulatory
scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot assure you that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition, we are
unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our
non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot
assure you that the impact will not be materially adverse to us.

As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares.

As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves
on our standalone unconsolidated Swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. Our articles of association allow us to create authorized share
capital that can be issued by the board of directors, but this authorization is limited to (i) authorized share capital up to 50% of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid
for a maximum of two years, which authorization period ends on March 9, 2013, and (ii) conditional share capital of up to 50% of the existing registered shares that may be issued only
for specific purposes. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital
and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital. Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms
that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions, including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to
liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par
value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders,
which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law
requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us, we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial
benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors.

Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against
us in Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize
or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or
those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of United States jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in
Swiss courts as they are contrary to that nation's public policy.



Swiss
corporate law, which applies to us, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the
manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification
available to directors and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a
jurisdiction of the United States.

Risks Relating to Our Shares

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including:

•

our quarterly or annual earnings;

•

changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide;

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global economic conditions and investors' concerns about
potential risks to future economic growth;

•

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;

•

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and

•

the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our
business.

We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

In order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax, we anticipate making distributions to
shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax purposes) or registered share capital. Interpretations of recently enacted Swiss tax legislation and various
proposals in Switzerland for tax law and corporate law changes, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax.
We are in discussions with Swiss tax authorities regarding certain administrative aspects of recently enacted Swiss tax legislation related to the classification of Swiss contributed surplus in our
Swiss statutory financial statements for tax and statutory reporting purposes. Should we not be successful in our discussions, we may need to formally enter into an appeal process in order to gain a
favorable ruling. Should we not gain favorable resolution, we may be required to make certain statutory reclassifications to Swiss contributed surplus in our Swiss statutory financial statements that
likely will limit our ability to make distributions on our shares free of Swiss withholding tax in future years. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for
future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax purposes) or through a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding
rules would not be changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited. Our ability to pay dividends or
distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders
and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors.



Currency fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Swiss Franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders
to Swiss withholding tax.

Under Swiss corporate law, we are required to state our year end unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements in Swiss Francs.
Although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in U.S. Dollars, shareholder resolutions with respect to such
distributions are required to be stated in Swiss Francs. If the U.S. Dollar were to increase in value relative to the Swiss Franc, the U.S. Dollar amount of registered share capital available for
future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease.

We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares.

The Swiss Code of Obligations regulates a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only
repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our
registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, only if our
shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares
are dedicated for cancellation. Additionally, interpretations of recently enacted Swiss tax legislation and various proposals in Switzerland for tax law and corporate law changes, if passed in the
future, may affect our ability to repurchase our shares. We are in discussions with Swiss tax authorities regarding certain administrative aspects of recently enacted Swiss tax legislation related to
the classification of Swiss contributed surplus in our Swiss statutory financial statements for tax and statutory reporting purposes. Should we not be successful in our discussions, we may need to
formally enter into an appeal process in order to gain a favorable ruling. Should we not gain favorable resolution, we may be required to make certain statutory reclassifications to Swiss contributed
surplus in our Swiss statutory financial statements that may negatively impact our ability to repurchase our shares. Our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital
management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to
investors.

Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings.

Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that
issue registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as
shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders' meetings, but all
shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register
shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association. Additionally, various proposals in Switzerland for
corporate law changes, if passed in the future, may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and
banks. Such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors.



Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders
might consider favorable.

Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered "anti-takeover" provisions because they would make
it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others:

•

shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and

•

restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15% or more of
our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors,

both
of which provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal
or delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorably by our shareholders. Our articles of association also
contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital (in either case, representing a maximum of 50% of the shares presently registered in the
commercial register and in the case of issuances from authorized capital, until March 9, 2013 unless re-authorized by shareholders for a subsequent two-year period)
without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders' preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened, or potential unsolicited
takeover bid, in relation to which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have
not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance
subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange, on which our shares are listed, requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to
20% or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Properties

Our principal offices in the United States are located in Berwyn, Pennsylvania in a facility that we rent. We operate approximately 100
manufacturing, warehousing, and office locations in over 30 states in the United States. We also operate over 275 manufacturing, warehousing, and office locations in over 50 countries and territories
outside the United States.

We
own approximately 20 million square feet of space and lease approximately 11 million square feet of space. Our facilities are reasonably maintained and suitable for the
operations conducted in them.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our products in over 20 countries worldwide. Our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of the manufacturing
processes, including our primary processes of stamping, plating, molding, extrusion, beaming, and assembly. We expect to continue to migrate our manufacturing activities to lower-cost
countries as our customers' requirements shift. In addition, we will continue to look for efficiencies to reduce our manufacturing costs and believe that we can achieve cost reductions through
improved manufacturing efficiency and the migration of manufacturing to lower-cost countries.

We estimate that our manufacturing production by region in fiscal 2011 was approximately: Americas—35%, Europe/Middle
East/Africa—35%, and Asia-Pacific—30%.

We
expect that manufacturing production will continue to increase in the Asia-Pacific region as a percentage of total manufacturing as this region continues to experience
strong growth and our customers' manufacturing continues to migrate to the region.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

TE Connectivity Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including antitrust claims, product
liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, tax matters, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant
patent legal claims. At any given time in the ordinary course of business, we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third
party's patent were to be determined against us, we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our



ability
to manufacture or sell one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on
our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.

Management
believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these
proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a future period.

Legal Matters under Separation and Distribution Agreement

The Separation and Distribution Agreement among us, Tyco International, and Covidien provided for the allocation among the parties of
Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to our and Covidien's separations from Tyco International on June 29, 2007. Under the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, we assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters at separation related to our business or assumed or retained liabilities. We were
responsible for 31% of certain liabilities that arose from litigation pending or threatened at separation that was not allocated to one of the three parties, and Tyco International and Covidien were
responsible for 27% and 42%, respectively, of such liabilities. If any party defaults in payment of its allocated share of any such liability, each non-defaulting party will be responsible
for an equal portion of the amount in default together with any other non-defaulting party, although any such payments will not release the obligation of the defaulting party. Subject to
the terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco International manages and controls all the legal matters related to the shared contingent
liabilities, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. All costs and expenses that Tyco International incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation, other
than the amount of any judgment or settlement, which is allocated in the manner described above, will be borne equally by Tyco International, Covidien, and us. At the present time, all significant
matters for which we shared responsibility with Tyco International and Covidien under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which as previously reported in our periodic filings generally related
to securities class action cases and other securities cases, have been settled. Other than matters described below under "Compliance Matters," we presently are not aware of any additional legal
matters which may arise for which we would bear a portion of the responsibility under the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in our periodic filings, Tyco International received and has responded to various allegations that certain
improper payments were made by Tyco International subsidiaries, including our subsidiaries, in recent years prior to the separation. Tyco International reported to the U.S. Department of Justice and
the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations, including that it retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review
of its policies, controls, and practices with respect to compliance with the FCPA, and that it would continue to investigate and make periodic progress reports to these agencies. To date, our baseline
review has revealed that some of our former business practices may not have complied with FCPA requirements. At this time, we believe we have adequate amounts recorded related to these matters, the
amounts of which are not significant. Any judgment, settlement, or other cost incurred by Tyco International in connection with these matters not specifically allocated to Tyco International,
Covidien, or us would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.



Matters Related to Our Former Wireless Systems Business

State of New York Contract

In September 2005, we were awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State of New York (the "State") to construct,
operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. In August 2008, we were served by the State with a default notice related to the
first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the State. In October 2008, we informed the
State that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing. The State conducted
further testing during November and December 2008. In January 2009, the State notified us that, in the State's opinion, we had not fully remediated the issues cited by the State and it had determined
that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State
in conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, in January 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit
funded by us. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit, although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so.

In
February 2009, we filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including breach of contract,
unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State terminated the
contract "for convenience." In September 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claim and a claim for breach of
warranty in connection with the State's drawdown on the $50 million letter of credit. In November 2009, the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract
and alleging that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. We moved to dismiss the counterclaim in February 2010, and in June 2010 the Court denied our motion. We filed our
answer to the State's counterclaim in July 2010. We believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter. We filed a motion for summary judgment on
the State's counterclaim and the State filed a motion for summary judgment on our remaining claims, which motions are under consideration. Oral argument on both parties' motions for summary judgment
has been set for November 29, 2011. A trial date has been set for February 2012.

Com-Net

At September 30, 2011, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001
acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system
for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not
believe we have any obligation to the sellers.
However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is in the discovery phase. A liability for
this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time.

in the form of a reduction of registered share capital.

Future dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders, if any, must be approved by our
shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash
requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant. We may from time to time enter into
financing agreements that contain financial covenants and restrictions, some of which may limit our ability to pay dividends or to distribute capital reductions. In addition, interpretations of
recently enacted Swiss tax legislation and various proposals in Switzerland for tax law and corporate law changes, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to
our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax. We are in discussions with Swiss tax authorities regarding certain administrative aspects of recently enacted Swiss tax legislation related to the
classification of Swiss contributed surplus in our Swiss statutory financial statements for tax and statutory reporting purposes. Should we not be successful in our discussions, we may need to
formally enter into an appeal process in order to gain a favorable ruling. Should we not gain favorable resolution, we may be required to make certain statutory reclassifications to Swiss contributed
surplus in our Swiss statutory financial statements that likely will limit our ability to make distributions on our shares free of Swiss withholding tax in future years.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,
estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those
factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Our
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

Organic
net sales growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures which are discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, together with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to investors because they reflect the financial measures that
management uses in evaluating the underlying results of our operations. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures,
including our reasons for including the measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures.

The Separation

Tyco Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of then Bermuda-based Tyco
International. Effective June 29, 2007, we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International. On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of
our shares, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses, to its common shareholders.



Change of Domicile

Effective June 25, 2009, we discontinued our existence as a Bermuda company as provided in the Bermuda Companies Act, and, in
accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued our existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of
Obligations (the "Change of Domicile"). The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

Company Name Change

In March 2011, our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of association to change our name from "Tyco
Electronics Ltd." to "TE Connectivity Ltd." The name change was effective March 10, 2011. Our ticker symbol "TEL" on the New York Stock Exchange remained unchanged.

Overview

We are a global company that designs and manufactures approximately 500,000 products that connect and protect the flow of power and
data inside millions of products used by consumers and industries. We partner with customers in a broad array of industries from consumer electronics, energy, and healthcare to automotive, aerospace,
and communication networks.

We
operate through three reporting segments: Transportation Solutions, Communications and Industrial Solutions, and Network Solutions. See Notes 1 and 23 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments.

We
service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries. The sales force is supported by approximately 7,500 engineers as well as
globally deployed manufacturing sites. Through our sales force and engineering resources, we are able to collaborate with our customers throughout the world to provide highly engineered products and
solutions to meet their needs.

Our
strategic objective is to increase our net sales and profitability across our segments in the markets we serve. This strategy is dependent upon the following strategic
priorities:

•

Deliver extraordinary customer service;

•

Strengthen our innovation leadership;

•

Extend our leadership in emerging markets;

•

Lead in smart connectivity; and

•

Supplement organic growth with strategic partnerships and acquisitions.

Outlook

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. Our sales are dependent
on certain industry end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be affected by changes in demand in those markets.
Overall, our net sales increased 18.6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, our net sales increased 17.7% as compared to fiscal 2009. Our sales into consumer based markets,
particularly in the automotive end market in the Transportation Solutions segment, have improved relative to fiscal 2010. Also, in industrial and infrastructure based markets, our sales in the telecom
networks, energy, enterprise networks, aerospace, defense, and marine, industrial, touch solutions, and data communications end markets have improved over prior year levels due to increased capital
spending by industry and governments. These improvements were partially offset by declines in the subsea communications and consumer devices end markets. Fiscal 2011 included an



additional
week which contributed $277 million in net sales and $0.08 per share to diluted earnings per share. ADC, which was acquired on December 8, 2010, contributed net sales of
$964 million, of which $26 million related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011.

The
earthquake and subsequent tsunami and aftershocks in Japan in March 2011 caused disruptions in our customers' operations and the supply chains that support their operations. We
estimate that net sales and diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by $99 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2011. Our facilities in Japan were not materially
damaged. We do not expect any further impact in fiscal 2012.

Net
sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 are expected to be between $3.4 and $3.5 billion, reflecting growth in the Transportation Solutions segment, particularly in the
automotive end market, and increased sales in the Network Solutions segment due to the acquisition of ADC. These increases are expected to be partially offset by weakness in the Communications and
Industrial Solutions segment as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In the first fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect diluted
earnings per share to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.70 per share. For fiscal 2012, we expect net sales to be between $14.3 and $14.9 billion and diluted earnings per share to be in the range
of $3.00 to $3.30 per share. This outlook assumes current foreign exchange and commodity rates.

We
are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and on the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in order to
respond to changing conditions. We are also managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. (See
further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources.")

Acquisitions

In July 2010, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire 100% of the outstanding stock of ADC,
a provider of broadband communications network connectivity products and related solutions. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer through a subsidiary to purchase all of the
issued and outstanding shares of ADC common stock at a purchase price of $12.75 per share in cash followed by a merger of the subsidiary with and into ADC, with ADC surviving as an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary. On December 8, 2010, we acquired 86.8% of the outstanding common shares of ADC. On December 9, 2010, we exercised our option under the Merger Agreement to
purchase additional shares from ADC that, when combined with the shares purchased in the tender offer, were sufficient to give us ownership of more than 90% of the outstanding ADC common shares. On
December 9, 2010, upon effecting a short-form merger under Minnesota law, we owned 100% of the outstanding shares of ADC for a total purchase price of approximately
$1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and $22 million representing the fair value of ADC share-based awards exchanged for TE Connectivity share options
and stock appreciation rights.

The
acquisition was made to accelerate our growth potential in the global broadband connectivity market. The combined organization offers a complete product portfolio across every major
geographic market. It also added ADC's Distributed Antenna System products, which expanded our wireless connectivity portfolio to provide greater mobile coverage and capacity solutions to carrier and
enterprise customers as demand for mobile data continues to expand. We have realized and expect additional cost savings and other synergies through operational efficiencies including the consolidation
of manufacturing, marketing, and general and administrative functions. ADC's businesses are reported as part of the Network Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

During
the period from December 9, 2010 to September 30, 2011, ADC contributed net sales of $964 million and an operating loss of $59 million to our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operating loss included restructuring charges of $82 million, charges of $41 million associated with the



amortization
of acquisition accounting-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, integration costs of $10 million, and acquisition
costs of $9 million.

In
January 2010, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Sensitive Object, an early-stage software company engaged in developing touch-enabling technology focused
on computers, mobile devices, and consumer electronics, for a purchase price of approximately $61 million in cash (net of cash acquired of $6 million), including contingent consideration
of $6 million paid in fiscal 2011. The Sensitive Object acquisition complements our existing Touch Solutions business, which is primarily focused on commercial and industrial markets. Sensitive
Object is reported as part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

See
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

Acquisition Related Restructuring

During fiscal 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan associated with the integration of ADC, which is expected to generate cost
efficiencies in our consolidated operations. As discussed above, in fiscal 2011, we recorded charges of $82 million related to this plan. Cash spending related to this plan was
$55 million in fiscal 2011. We expect total cash spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $27 million in fiscal 2012. Annualized cost savings related
to these actions are expected to be approximately $100 million, of which approximately 40% was realized in fiscal 2011 with the remaining 60% to be realized in fiscal 2012. Cost savings will be
reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Manufacturing Simplification and Cost Actions due to Current Economic Conditions

We plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint by migrating facilities from higher-cost to
lower-cost countries, consolidating
within countries, and transferring product lines to lower-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating
leverage, and position us for profitability growth in the years ahead.

In
connection with our manufacturing simplification plan and in response to economic conditions, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $67 million during fiscal 2011
and expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $60 million during fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2011, cash spending related to restructuring was $67 million. We expect total
spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $111 million in fiscal 2012.

Divestitures

During fiscal 2010, we sold our mechatronics business for net cash proceeds of $3 million. This business designed and
manufactured customer-specific components, primarily for the automotive industry, and generated sales of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2010. In connection with the sale, we recorded a
pre-tax loss on sale of $41 million in fiscal 2010.

Also,
in fiscal 2010, we completed the sale of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line which was part of our energy business in the Network Solutions segment for net cash
proceeds of $12 million. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets and a pre-tax loss on sale
totaling $13 million in fiscal 2010. Also, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $12 million in fiscal 2009 to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities
down to fair value. The Dulmison connectors and fittings product line generated sales of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009.



During
fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Battery Systems business, which was part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment, for net cash proceeds of
$14 million after working capital adjustments. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $7 million in fiscal 2009.

The
loss on divestitures and impairment charges are presented in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have presented the loss on
divestitures, related
long-lived asset impairments, and operations of the mechatronics business, Dulmison connectors and fittings product line, and Battery Systems business in continuing operations due to
immateriality. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestitures.

Discontinued Operations

In fiscal 2010, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in connection with the favorable
resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007.

In
fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Wireless Systems business for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on the
transaction. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds of $29 million and recognized an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the
finalization of working capital adjustments related to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which were sold in fiscal 2008.

See
Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

We
have completed the divestiture of underperforming or non-strategic businesses and product lines that we began over four years ago; however, we continue to evaluate
specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures.

Results of Operations

Consolidated Operations

Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this report
include:

•

Raw material
prices.

We purchased approximately 169 million pounds of copper, 168,000 troy ounces of gold, and 3.5 million troy ounces
of silver in fiscal 2011. Prices have increased in recent years and continue to fluctuate. The following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, and silver during fiscal
2011, 2010, and 2009:

•

Foreign
exchange.

Approximately 55% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our results of operations are
influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we
translate those currencies into U.S. Dollars at the end



of
each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2011 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:

Net Sales.

Net sales increased $2,242 million, or 18.6%, to $14,312 million in fiscal 2011 from $12,070 million
in fiscal 2010.
On an organic basis, net sales increased $749 million, or 6.2%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of growth in the Transportation Solutions segment. Price erosion
adversely affected organic sales by $192 million in fiscal 2011. Foreign currency



exchange
rates positively impacted net sales by $394 million, or 3.3%, in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed $277 million in net sales. ADC, which was
acquired on December 8, 2010, contributed net sales of $964 million, of which $26 million related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011. The divestitures of the mechatronics
business and the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $116 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.

Net
sales increased $1,814 million, or 17.7%, to $12,070 million in fiscal 2010 from $10,256 million in fiscal 2009. On an organic basis, net sales increased
$1,712 million, or 16.7%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from strong growth in the Transportation Solutions
segment, and, to a lesser degree, the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment. Price erosion adversely affected organic sales by $169 million in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, foreign
currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $188 million, or 1.8%. The divestitures of the Battery Systems business in fiscal 2009 and Dulmison connectors and fittings product line
in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $86 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

Gross Margin.

In fiscal 2011, gross margin increased $645 million to $4,422 million from $3,777 million in fiscal
2010. Gross
margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 30.9% in fiscal 2011 as compared to 31.3% in fiscal 2010. The increase in gross margin was due to the increase in net sales and, to a lesser degree,
improved manufacturing productivity and cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions, partially offset by price erosion, increases in material costs, unfavorable product mix, and the impact of
the earthquake in Japan. In addition, fiscal 2011 included charges of $41 million associated with the amortization of acquisition accounting-related fair value adjustments primarily related to
acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated with ADC.

In
fiscal 2010, gross margin increased $1,241 million to $3,777 million from $2,536 million in fiscal 2009. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to
31.3% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 24.7% in fiscal 2009. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to higher sales and improved manufacturing productivity, and to a lesser degree, favorable
product mix and cost reductions achieved from restructuring actions implemented during fiscal 2009.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $242 million in
fiscal 2011 to
$1,780 million from $1,538 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was related primarily to increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels and the acquisition of ADC. Selling,
general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.4% and 12.7% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses increased $130 million in fiscal 2010 to $1,538 million from $1,408 million in fiscal 2009. Selling, general, and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.7% and 13.7% in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Fiscal 2009 results included a net loss



of
approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European
currencies. Excluding this item, selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 further decreased as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of increased sales
and cost reductions achieved from restructuring actions implemented during fiscal 2009.

Acquisition and Integration Costs.

In connection with the acquisition of ADC, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of
$19 million and
$8 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.

In fiscal 2011, net restructuring and other charges were $149 million as compared to
$137 million
in fiscal 2010 and $375 million in fiscal 2009. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of sales, were $149 million, $134 million, and $373 million in fiscal
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Fiscal
2011 actions were primarily associated with the acquisition of ADC and related headcount reductions in the Network Solutions segment. Additionally, we increased reductions in
force as a result of current economic conditions, primarily in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment.

Fiscal
2010 actions primarily related to headcount reductions in the Transportation Solutions segment. Fiscal 2010 charges included a pre-tax loss on sale of
$41 million in the Transportation Solutions segment related to the sale of our mechatronics business, as well as a long-lived asset impairment charge and a loss on sale totaling
$13 million related to the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line which was part of the energy business in the Network Solutions segment.

Fiscal
2009 actions primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures across all segments in response to economic conditions and implementation of our
manufacturing simplification plan. Fiscal 2009 charges included a long-lived asset impairment of $14 million in the Network Solutions segment primarily related to the divestiture of
the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line and a loss on sale of $7 million related to the sale of the Battery Systems business which was part of the Communications and Industrial
Solutions segment.

See
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Pre-separation Litigation Charges (Income), Net.

During fiscal 2010, Tyco International settled the remaining significant
securities
lawsuit, a class action captioned

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

, for $79 million. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the
Separation and Distribution Agreement, our share of the settlement amount was $24 million. We had previously established reserves for this case in fiscal 2009. As a result of the settlement of
the

Stumpf

case, we concluded that reserves of $22 million could be released. Accordingly, pursuant to the sharing formula, we recorded income of
$7 million during fiscal 2010. As of September 30, 2011, there were no remaining securities lawsuits outstanding.

During
fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $144 million for our share of Tyco International's settlements of several securities cases and our portion of the estimated probable
loss for the then remaining securities litigation claims, including the

Stumpf

case, subject to the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

See
"Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pre-separation
securities litigation.

Impairment of Goodwill.

During fiscal 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2,088 million related to the
Automotive reporting
unit of the Transportation Solutions segment. Also, in fiscal 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,459 million in the Communications and



Industrial
Solutions segment, of which $1,347 million and $112 million related to the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Circuit Protection reporting units, respectively.

See
Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of goodwill.

Operating Income (Loss).

Operating income was $1,741 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,516 million
in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed $53 million of operating income. As discussed above, results for fiscal 2011 included net restructuring and other
charges of $149 million, charges of $41 million associated with the amortization of acquisition accounting-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and
customer order backlog, and acquisition and integration costs of $19 million. Fiscal 2010 results included restructuring and other charges, acquisition and integration costs, and
pre-separation litigation income of $134 million, $8 million, and $7 million, respectively. Excluding these items, the increase in operating income resulted from
increased sales levels and related gross margin, and, to a lesser degree, a reduction in employee incentive compensation-related expense, the acquisition of ADC, cost reduction benefits from
restructuring actions, and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by price erosion, increases in material costs, and unfavorable product mix.

Operating
income was $1,516 million in fiscal 2010 compared to an operating loss of $3,474 million in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 results included restructuring and other
charges, acquisition and integration costs, and pre-separation litigation income of $134 million, $8 million, and $7 million, respectively. Fiscal 2009 results
included goodwill impairment charges, restructuring and other charges, and pre-separation litigation charges of $3,547 million, $373 million, and $144 million,
respectively. In addition, fiscal 2009 results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and
resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding these items, the increase in operating income resulted primarily from higher sales and related gross margins,
higher gross margins as a percentage of sales due to favorable product mix, and cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009, partially offset by price erosion.

Non-Operating Items

Other Income (Expense), Net

In fiscal 2011, we recorded net other income of $27 million, primarily consisting of income pursuant to the Tax Sharing
Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. During fiscal 2011, we recorded other expense of $14 million in connection with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S.
tax matters. See additional information in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding
the Tax Sharing Agreement.

In
fiscal 2010, we recorded net other income of $177 million, primarily consisting of income pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. The income
in fiscal 2010 reflects a
net increase to the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien primarily related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period income tax returns and related accrued interest, partially offset
by a decrease related to the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns.

In
fiscal 2009, we recorded net other expense of $48 million, primarily consisting of $68 million of expense pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International
and Covidien and a $22 million gain on the retirement of debt. The $68 million of expense is attributable to a net reduction of the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien
primarily as a result of the settlement



of
various matters with the IRS. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the gain on retirement of debt.

Income Taxes

Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We have provided for
income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation.

Our
effective income tax rate was 23.1% for fiscal 2011 and reflects income tax benefits recognized in connection with profitability in certain entities operating in lower tax rate
jurisdictions partially offset by accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects income tax benefits of $35 million
associated with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S. tax matters.

Our
effective income tax rate was 31.6% for fiscal 2010 and reflects charges of $307 million primarily associated with certain proposed adjustments to prior year income tax
returns and related accrued interest partially offset by income tax benefits of $101 million recognized in connection with the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year
income tax returns. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflects an income tax benefit of $72 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance
associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations.

Our
effective income tax rate was 15.4% for fiscal 2009 and includes the effects of the $3,547 million pre-tax impairment of goodwill for which a partial tax benefit
of $523 million was
recorded, a $144 million pre-tax charge related to pre-separation securities litigation for which a partial tax benefit of $25 million was recorded, a
$28 million charge related to the settlement of a tax matter, and a $24 million detriment related to a $68 million pre-tax expense recognized pursuant to our Tax
Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects adjustments related to prior years tax returns, including a
$49 million tax benefit.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,930 million and $2,236 million at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty
of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable
income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC
740 which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our
operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss
carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities.
These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our
current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded
amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate



of
tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized.

We
have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in
fiscal 2012. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for
temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or
we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 30, 2011, certain subsidiaries had approximately
$17 billion of undistributed earnings that we intend to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are
distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are
ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes

In fiscal 2010, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in connection with the favorable
resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007.

In
fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Wireless Systems business for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on the
transaction. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds of $29 million and recognized an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the
finalization of working capital adjustments related to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which were sold in fiscal 2008.

Pre-tax
loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 included pre-tax charges of $111 million related to the Wireless Systems business's contract with
the State of New York. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the State of New York contract. Income tax expense on discontinued operations
for fiscal 2009 included $68 million relating to the impact of $319 million of goodwill written off in connection with the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business, for which a tax
benefit was not fully realized, as well as $35 million of unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax provision on the Power Systems business as a result of the finalization of the tax basis
of assets sold upon the filing of the fiscal 2008 income tax returns.

The
Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Automotive Radar Sensors, Power Systems, and Printed Circuit Group businesses met the held for sale and discontinued
operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued
operations, the Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses were components of the former Wireless Systems segment. The Power Systems and
Printed Circuit Group businesses were components of the former Other segment.

See
Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

Transportation Solutions' net sales increased $830 million, or 17.3%, to $5,629 million in fiscal 2011 from
$4,799 million in fiscal 2010. Organic net sales increased by $621 million, or 13.0%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to an increase of $562 million in the
automotive end market. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively affected net sales by $179 million, or 3.7%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an
additional week which contributed approximately $112 million in net sales. The divestiture of the mechatronics business in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $82 million in fiscal
2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.



In the automotive end market, our organic net sales growth was 13.5% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was attributable to growth of 17.9%
in the EMEA region, 14.4% in the Americas region, and 7.7% in the Asia-Pacific region. Growth in the EMEA and Americas regions resulted from higher automotive production and increased
content per vehicle. Growth in the Asia-Pacific region was negatively impacted by the earthquake in Japan. We estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in the
automotive end market by $38 million in fiscal 2011. We expect global automotive production in fiscal 2012 to increase to approximately 6% over fiscal 2011 levels. In the aerospace, defense,
and marine end market, our organic net sales increased 9.5% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of increased demand from commercial aircraft builders as they continue to
increase production and, in the marine market, as a result of increased oil and gas exploration driven by increasing crude oil prices.

Transportation
Solutions' operating income increased $333 million to $848 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $515 million in fiscal 2010. Segment results included
$14 million of net credits and $94 million of net charges to restructuring and other charges (credits) in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding these items, the increase in
operating income was due to favorable impacts of increased volume and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by increases in material costs and price erosion.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

Transportation Solutions' net sales increased $1,281 million, or 36.4%, to $4,799 million in fiscal 2010 from
$3,518 million in fiscal 2009. Organic net sales increased by $1,173 million, or 33.3%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due primarily to an increase of $1,175 million in
the automotive end market. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively affected net sales by $108 million, or 3.1%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

In
the automotive end market, our organic net sales increased 40.4% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was broad-based and resulted from growth of 61.4% in the
Asia-Pacific region, 40.1% in the Americas region, and 33.8% in the EMEA region driven by increases in vehicle production and replenishment of inventory in the supply chain across all
regions. In the aerospace, defense, and marine end market, our organic net sales decline of 0.8% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due to weak demand in the marine and commercial aircraft
markets, partially offset by growth in the defense market.

Transportation
Solutions had operating income of $515 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to an operating loss of $2,254 million in fiscal 2009. Segment results included
restructuring and other charges of $94 million and $171 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Also, during fiscal 2009, segment results included goodwill impairment charges of
$2,088 million and a net foreign currency loss of approximately $17 million associated primarily with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily
from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding these items, the increase resulted primarily from increases in sales and higher gross margins as a percentage of sales, as well
as cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009, and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by price erosion.

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

Communications and Industrial Solutions' net sales increased $251 million, or 5.2%, to $5,071 million in fiscal 2011 as
compared to $4,820 million in fiscal 2010. Organic net sales increased $50 million, or 1.1%, during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. We estimate that the earthquake in



Japan
negatively impacted our organic sales in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment by $61 million in fiscal 2011. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively
affected net sales by $132 million, or 2.7%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $91 million in net sales.
The divestiture of the mechatronics business in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $22 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.

In
the industrial end market, our organic net sales increased 6.9% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to strong growth in the industrial machinery market,
particularly in the EMEA region, as well as growth in the commercial and building and factory automation markets. In the data communications end market, our organic net sales increased 2.6% in fiscal
2011 from fiscal 2010 due to strength in sales in the server, data storage, and wireless markets, particularly in the EMEA region. In the appliance end market, our organic net sales growth of 3.6% in
fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was due to continued consumer demand in the EMEA region, partially offset by decreases in the Americas region. In the consumer devices end market, our organic
net sales decreased 12.0% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to weaker demand in the mobile phone and consumer electronics markets driven by our platform position, as well as the negative
impact of the earthquake in Japan. In the computer end market, our organic net sales decrease of 1.2% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was attributable to soft demand in the personal computer
market, partially offset by growth in the tablets and portables markets. In the touch solutions end market, our organic net sales increased 1.8% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 as a result
of increased sales in the retail market, particularly in the EMEA region.

In
fiscal 2011, Communications and Industrial Solutions' operating income decreased $118 million to $564 million from $682 million in fiscal 2010. Segment results
included net restructuring and other charges of $76 million and $20 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding these items, the decrease in operating income was
attributable to price erosion and increased material costs, partially offset by volume increases and cost reduction benefits associated with restructuring actions.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

Communications and Industrial Solutions' net sales increased $962 million, or 24.9%, to $4,820 million in fiscal 2010
from $3,858 million in fiscal 2009. Organic net sales increased $955 million, or 24.7%, during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies
positively affected net sales by $54 million, or 1.5%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The divestiture of the Battery Systems business in fiscal 2009 negatively impacted sales by
$47 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

In
the industrial end market, our organic net sales increased 28.7% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due primarily to increased demand for factory automation and other
industrial equipment in all regions, with the highest growth in Asia. In the data communications end market, our organic net sales increased 18.1% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result
of an increase in sales of our interconnect components to communication equipment manufacturers. In the appliance end market, our organic net sales growth of 45.6% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal
2009 was attributable to improved consumer demand across all regions, particularly in Asia. In the consumer devices end market, our organic net sales growth of 20.2% in fiscal 2010 as compared to
fiscal 2009 was due primarily to an increase in sales to mobile phone manufacturers. In the computer end market, our organic net sales growth of 14.5% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009
resulted from recovery in emerging markets and rising demand for portables, such as notebook computers. In the touch solutions end market, our organic net sales growth of 16.9% in fiscal 2010 over
fiscal 2009 was due to improved demand in North America and Asia, particularly with point-of-sale terminal manufacturers, partially offset by continued weakness in global
demand in the gaming markets.



Communications
and Industrial Solutions had operating income of $682 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to an operating loss of $1,428 million in fiscal 2009. Segment
results included net restructuring and other charges of $20 million and $138 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. In fiscal 2009, segment results were negatively impacted
by goodwill impairment charges of $1,459 million and a net foreign currency loss of approximately $33 million associated primarily with economic hedges of certain anticipated future
transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding these items, the increase in operating income was due primarily to an increase in gross
margin, primarily as a result of the increase in sales, and to a lesser degree, favorable product mix and cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009, as well as
improved manufacturing productivity.

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

In fiscal 2011, Network Solutions' net sales increased $1,161 million, or 47.4%, to $3,612 million from
$2,451 million in fiscal 2010. Organic net sales increased $78 million, or 3.3%, in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively impacted net
sales by $83 million, or 3.3%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $74 million in net sales. The
acquisition of ADC increased sales by $964 million, of which $26 million is related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011. The divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings
product line in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $12 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.

In
the telecom networks end market, our organic net sales increase of 22.6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was largely due to increased fiber network investment by
telecommunications companies, particularly in the EMEA and South America regions. In the energy end market, our organic net sales increased 11.4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due
primarily to a continuing strong recovery across all regions. In the enterprise networks end market, our organic net sales increased 9.7% in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 levels as a result of
increased data center investment in the EMEA region, particularly in India, and the Asia-Pacific region. The subsea communications end market's organic net sales decreased 21.4% in fiscal
2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 as a result of lower levels of project activity. We expect net sales in fiscal 2012 in the subsea communications end market to be similar to fiscal 2011 levels.

Network
Solutions' operating income increased $17 million to $329 million in fiscal 2011 from $312 million in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, segment results
included $142 million of charges related to the acquisition of ADC, including $82 million of restructuring charges, $41 million of charges associated with the amortization of
acquisition accounting-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, and $19 million of acquisition and integration costs. Segment results
also included additional net restructuring and other charges of $5 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, segment results included $20 million of net restructuring and other charges and
$8 million of acquisition and integration costs. Excluding these items, operating income increased as a result of the acquisition of ADC and volume increases, partially offset by unfavorable
product mix, price erosion, and increased material costs.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

In fiscal 2010, Network Solutions' net sales decreased $429 million, or 14.9%, to $2,451 million from
$2,880 million in fiscal 2009. Organic net sales decreased $416 million, or 14.5%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably
affected net sales by $26 million, or 1.0%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The
divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line negatively impacted net sales by $39 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

In
the telecom networks end market, our organic net sales decrease of 2.3% in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 levels was primarily attributable to reduced wireline capital
spending by telecommunications companies. In the energy end market, our organic net sales decrease of 1.9% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due to lower investment levels by
utilities and reduced customer inventory levels. In the enterprise networks end market, organic sales increased 7.7% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of strong
economic recoveries in Asia and Europe, while the Americas remained relatively flat. In the subsea communications end market, our organic net sales decreased 37.6% in fiscal 2010 as compared to
fiscal 2009 due to the completion of certain large projects during fiscal 2009 and lower levels of project activity in fiscal 2010.



In fiscal 2010, Network Solutions' operating income decreased $40 million to $312 million from $352 million in fiscal 2009.
Segment results included $20 million of net restructuring and other charges and $8 million of acquisition and integration costs in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2009, segment
results included $64 million of net restructuring and other charges. Excluding these items, the operating income decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales due to lower levels of
project activity in the subsea communications end market, and to a lesser degree, price erosion, partially offset by cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in
fiscal 2009 and improved manufacturing productivity.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be
affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from
operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. We may use excess cash to reduce
our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law, to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase
program, to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares, or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines. The cost or availability of future funding may
be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets, to respond as necessary to changing conditions.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,779 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to
$1,679 million in fiscal 2010. The increase of $100 million in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from higher income levels partially offset by a
reduction of accrued and other current liabilities related to employee compensation-related payments, higher income taxes paid, and payments for pre-separation tax matters.

Net
cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,679 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to $1,378 million in fiscal 2009. The increase of
$301 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 primarily resulted from higher income levels, partially offset by increased working capital to support current business levels.

Pension
and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $90 million, $180 million, and $145 million, respectively. These
amounts included voluntary pension contributions of $69 million and $61 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively; there were no voluntary contributions in
fiscal 2011. We expect pension and postretirement benefit contributions to be $102 million in fiscal 2012, before consideration of voluntary contributions.

The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $299 million, $156 million, and $121 million, respectively.

In
fiscal 2011, cash payments related to pre-separation tax matters were $129 million, net of indemnification payments under the Tax Sharing Agreement. We
expect to make additional net cash payments of approximately $90 million over the next twelve months related to these matters. These amounts include payments in which we are the primary obligor
to the taxing authorities and for which we expect a portion to be reimbursed by Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement as well as indemnification payments to Tyco
International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement for tax matters where they are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information related to pre-separation tax matters.



In
addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of our cash generation which is free from any significant existing obligation. Free
cash flow was $1,392 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $1,404 million in fiscal 2010 and $1,226 million in fiscal 2009. The decline in free cash flow in
fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by increases in capital expenditures, partially offset by increases in cash provided by operating activities. The increase in
free cash flow in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was due primarily to increases in cash provided by operating activities. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash
provided by continuing operating activities, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

We continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further
enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. Capital spending increased $196 million in fiscal 2011 to $581 million as compared to $385 million in
fiscal 2010. Capital spending was $328 million in fiscal 2009. We expect fiscal 2012 capital spending levels to be approximately 4% to 5% of net sales.

During
fiscal 2011, we acquired ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and
$22 million of other non-cash consideration. Short-term investments acquired in connection with the acquisition of ADC were sold for proceeds of $155 million in
fiscal 2011. Certain other assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of ADC were sold for net proceeds of $111 million, of which approximately $106 million was received
in fiscal 2011. We also acquired another business for $14 million in cash in fiscal 2011.

During
fiscal 2010, we acquired Sensitive Object for a purchase price of $61 million (net of cash acquired of $6 million), which includes $6 million of
contingent consideration paid in fiscal 2011. Also, we acquired the remaining outstanding equity interests of PlanarMag for $23 million in cash and the forgiveness of an approximate
$1 million loan payable. In addition, we acquired certain assets of the Optical Products Group of Zarlink for $15 million in cash.

During
fiscal 2010, we received net cash proceeds of $3 million and $12 million related to the sale of the mechatronics business and the Dulmison connectors and
fittings product line, respectively.

In
fiscal 2009, we received net cash proceeds of $664 million related to the sale of our Wireless Systems business. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash
proceeds related to working capital of $29 million in connection with the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystems and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which occurred in
fiscal 2008 and $17 million primarily related to the divestiture of the Battery Systems business.



Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization

Total debt at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010 was $2,669 million and $2,413 million, respectively. See
Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

In
December 2010, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $250 million principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due
January 15, 2021. The notes were offered and sold pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed on July 1, 2008, as amended on June 26,
2009. Interest on the notes accrues from the issuance date at a rate of 4.875% per year and is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning
July 15, 2011. The notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any
subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment on an unsecured senior basis by TE Connectivity Ltd. Net proceeds from the
issuance were approximately $249 million.

In
the first quarter of fiscal 2011, in connection with the acquisition of ADC, we assumed $653 million of convertible subordinated notes due 2013, 2015,
and 2017. Under the terms of the indentures governing these convertible subordinated notes, following the acquisition of ADC, the right to convert the notes into shares of ADC common stock
changed to the right to convert the notes into cash. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the ADC acquisition. In December 2010, our ADC subsidiary
commenced offers to purchase $650 million aggregate principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes at par plus accrued interest, pursuant to the terms of the indentures for the notes.
The offers to purchase expired in January 2011. Promptly thereafter, $198 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2013, $55 million principal
amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2015, and $218 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2017 were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of
$471 million. All of the convertible subordinated notes purchased by ADC have been cancelled.

In
March 2011, in connection with an internal reorganization related to the acquisition of ADC, our ADC subsidiary commenced offers to purchase $177 million aggregate
principal amount of its convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and 2017 at par plus accrued interest, pursuant to the terms of the indentures for the notes. The offers to purchase
expired in April 2011. Promptly thereafter, $81 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and $7 million principal amount of the convertible
subordinated notes due 2017 were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of $89 million. All of the convertible subordinated notes purchased by ADC have been cancelled. Our debt balance at
fiscal year end 2011 included the remaining $90 million of 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and $2 million of floating rate convertible subordinated notes
due 2013.

On
June 24, 2011, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"), with total commitments of $1,500 million, and
terminated its then existing
five-year senior unsecured credit agreement, which at the time of termination had total commitments of $1,425 million and was scheduled to mature on April 25, 2012. TEGSA had
no borrowings under the Credit Facility at September 30, 2011. Also, TEGSA had no borrowings under its then existing facility at September 24, 2010.

Borrowings
under the Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable
margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Deutsche Bank AG New York branch's
base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus


/


of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin
based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30.0 basis points based upon the amount of the
lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA.



The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit
Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.5 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as
defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our
operations. As of September 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable
future.

During
June 2009, TEGSA commenced a tender offer to purchase up to $150 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, up to $100 million principal
amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and up to $100 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037. On July 7, 2009, the tender offer expired and on
July 9, 2009, TEGSA purchased and cancelled $86 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $42 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due
2017, and $23 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037 for an aggregate payment of $141 million, plus paid accrued interest through July 7, 2009 of
$3 million to the sellers of the notes. As a result of the transaction, in fiscal 2009, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million, which is included in other income,
including the write-off of unamortized discounts and fees of $1 million and the recognition of a gain of $12 million associated with terminated interest rate swaps previously
designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, as a result of the re-purchase and cancellation, unamortized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income of $3 million related to
terminated forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were recognized as interest expense.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial
paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. TEGSA made no borrowings during fiscal 2011 and had no commercial paper outstanding at fiscal year end 2011. As of fiscal year
end 2010, TEGSA had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding at an interest rate of 0.55%.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by TE Connectivity Ltd. Neither TE
Connectivity Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries provides a guarantee as to payment obligations under notes issued by ADC prior to its acquisition in December 2010.

Payments
of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $296 million, $289 million, and $294 million in fiscal 2011, 2010,
and 2009, respectively. On June 22, 2009, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of
CHF 0.17 per share. During the quarter ended September 25, 2009, the distribution was paid in U.S. Dollars at a rate of $0.16 per share. This capital reduction reduced the par value of
our common shares from CHF 2.60 (equivalent to $2.40) to CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24).

In
October 2009, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.34
(equivalent to $0.32) per share, payable in two equal installments in each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. We paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a
rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended December 25, 2009 and March 26, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.43
(equivalent to $2.24) to CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92).

In
March 2010, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.72
(equivalent to $0.64) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 through the



second
quarter of fiscal 2011. We paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended June 25, 2010 and
September 24, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92) to CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60). We paid the third
and fourth installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended December 24, 2010 and March 25, 2011. These capital reductions reduced the par
value of our common shares from CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60) to CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28).

In
March 2011, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.68 (equivalent to $0.72) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal
quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 through the second quarter of fiscal 2012 to shareholders of record on specified dates in each of the four quarters.
We paid the first and second installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.18 per share each during the quarters ended June 24, 2011 and September 30, 2011.

In
September 2011, our board of directors approved a recommendation to increase the quarterly dividend 17%, from $0.18 to $0.21 per share, for the four fiscal quarters beginning
with the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This recommendation will be presented for shareholder approval at our annual general meeting of shareholders in March 2012. This recommendation may be in
the form of a cash distribution through a capital reduction in the par value of our common shares.

Contributed
surplus established during the Change of Domicile for Swiss tax and statutory purposes ("Swiss Contributed Surplus"), subject to certain conditions, is a freely distributable
reserve. Upon our implementation of recently enacted Swiss tax law regarding the classification of Swiss Contributed Surplus for Swiss tax and statutory purposes, distributions to shareholders from
Swiss Contributed Surplus will be free from withholding tax. We are in discussions with Swiss tax authorities regarding certain administrative aspects of the law related to the classification of Swiss
Contributed Surplus for tax and statutory reporting purposes. Should we not be successful in our discussions, we may need to formally enter into an appeal process in order to gain a favorable ruling.
Should we not gain favorable resolution, we may be required to make certain statutory reclassifications to Swiss Contributed Surplus that likely will limit our ability to make distributions free of
withholding tax in future years and may negatively impact our ability to repurchase our shares in future years. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

During
fiscal 2011, our board of directors authorized a total increase in the share repurchase authorization of $2,250 million, of which $750 million was authorized
in the first quarter and $1,500 million was authorized in the fourth quarter. We purchased approximately 25 million of our common shares for $867 million, approximately
18 million of our common shares for $488 million, and approximately 6 million of our common shares for $125 million during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009,
respectively. At September 30, 2011, we had $1,501 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $102 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in
fiscal 2012, before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASC 460.

Income Tax Matters

In connection with the separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Covidien's, and Tyco
International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result
of any failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of Covidien to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of
Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities
relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us
with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of
certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to
default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties'



obligation.
We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for
their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

In
September 2011, Tyco International announced its intention to spin-off two of its businesses to its shareholders, with Tyco International remaining as a publicly-traded
company. Although these transactions are in preliminary stages, we expect that Tyco International will continue to meet its legal obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement.

Prior
to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by
various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit
controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related
interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to our entities, have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco International's tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated
Financial Statements. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In
prior years, in connection with the IRS audit of various fiscal years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns
resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. The IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the IRS had
completed its field work. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we have determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2006 is more likely
than not to be accepted and, accordingly, have recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
fiscal 2009, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and in connection with these adjustments, we recorded a
$97 million increase in income tax liabilities, a $10 million increase in deferred tax assets, a $60 million increase in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in
connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, and a $27 million charge to contributed surplus. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien.

As
our tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to separation, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. While
the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed and accepted by the IRS, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact
on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Additionally, adjustments may be recorded to equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income tax returns in
certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and/or our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the separation.

During
fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue
Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Tyco International has appealed certain proposed adjustments totaling approximately
$1 billion. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers
of stock in 1998 and 1999. Based upon statutory guidelines, Tyco International estimates the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. The penalty is asserted
against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that



was
distributed to us in connection with the separation. Any penalty ultimately imposed upon our subsidiary would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing
Agreement. It is our understanding that Tyco International continues to make progress towards resolving a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000; however,
several significant matters remain in dispute. The remaining issues in dispute involve the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. Tyco International has indicated that it is unlikely
to achieve the resolution of these contested adjustments through the IRS appeals process, and therefore may be required to litigate the disputed issues. For those issues not remaining in dispute, it
is likely that Tyco International will settle with the IRS and pay any related deficiencies within the next twelve months. Over the next twelve months, we expect to pay approximately
$90 million, inclusive of related indemnification payments, in connection with pre-separation tax matters.

During
fiscal 2011, the IRS completed its field examination of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, issued Revenue Agent Reports which
reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004 period, and issued certain notices of deficiency. As a result of the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of
certain tax matters in fiscal 2011, we recognized income tax benefits of $35 million and other expense of $14 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement. For a portion of these
pre-separation deficiencies, we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for which we paid $132 million in fiscal 2011. Concurrent with remitting these payments, we
were reimbursed $93 million from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters. In addition, we paid a total of
$115 million in fiscal 2011 to Tyco International and Covidien for our share of 2001 through 2004 pre-separation tax deficiencies for which Tyco International and Covidien
are the primary obligors to the taxing authorities. As a result, our net cash payment attributable to these matters was $154 million in fiscal 2011.

The
IRS commenced its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011.

During
fiscal 2009, Tyco International settled a matter with the IRS concerning certain tax deductions claimed on Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001
through 2004. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a $28 million income tax charge in fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions.

At
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, we have reflected $232 million and $244 million, respectively, of income tax liabilities related to the audits
of Tyco International's and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within one year.

We
continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is
uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Legal Matters

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims,
product liability matters, employment disputes, tax matters, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, and antitrust claims. Management believes that these legal
proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information,
and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a future period.



See
"Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Matters Related to Our Former Wireless Systems Business

Certain liabilities and contingencies related to our former Wireless Systems business were retained by us when this business was sold
in fiscal 2009. These include certain retained liabilities related to the State of New York contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the acquisition of Com-Net
by the Wireless Systems business in 2001. See additional information below. Also, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the
Wireless Systems business.

State of New York Contract

In September 2005, we were awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State of New York (the "State") to
construct, operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. In August 2008, we were served by the State with a default notice
related to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the State. In
October 2008, we informed the State that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system
ready for testing. The State conducted further testing during November and December 2008. In January 2009, the State notified us that, in the State's opinion, we had not fully remediated
the issues cited by the State and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that it has the right
under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State in conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, in January 2009, the State drew down
$50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit, although
we dispute that the State has any basis to do so.

In
February 2009, we filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State terminated
the contract "for convenience." In September 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claim and a claim
for breach of warranty in connection with the State's drawdown on the $50 million letter of credit. In November 2009, the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim
asserting breach of contract and alleging that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. We moved to dismiss the counterclaim in February 2010, and in June 2010
the Court denied our motion. We filed our answer to the State's counterclaim in July 2010. We believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this
matter. A trial date has been set for February 2012.

As
a result of these actions, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $111 million associated with this contract. These
charges are reflected in loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of our sale of the Wireless Systems business. See Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations and the sale of the Wireless Systems business. The charges included an impairment charge of $61 million to
write-off all costs incurred in constructing the network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the State against the standby letter of credit of $50 million.



Com-Net

At September 30, 2011, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our
fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a
communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale
agreement, we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is in the discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any
payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and
financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2012 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of
nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks
involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities
and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or
cash flows.

At
September 30, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $436 million, of which $50 million was related to our
contract with the State of New York. In January 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. As a result, we recorded a
pre-tax charge equal to the draw. Although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so, the State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby
letter of credit which could result in additional charges and could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We
have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of
these liabilities.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, except for the potential claims related to the contract
with the State of New York discussed above, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities
relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us
with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of
certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies



responsible
for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or
parties' obligation. These arrangements have been valued upon our separation from Tyco International in accordance with ASC 460 and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to $249 million
were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2011. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following noted accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and
assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605,

Revenue
Recognition

, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13,

Revenue Recognition

.

Our
revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the
customer.
This generally occurs when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items
where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is
recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on
historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are
based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs.
Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they
first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become
determinable. Contract revenues for construction related projects are generated primarily in the Network Solutions segment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a
determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are
amortized generally on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and
circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is
assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal
quarter of each year or whenever we believe a



triggering
event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting unit specific factors including
operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's
judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in ASC 350,

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other

. First, we
perform a step I goodwill impairment test to
identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be
impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit
goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a
reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a
reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Estimates
about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each
reporting unit. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth
rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could
result in goodwill impairments in future periods.

We
completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and determined that no impairment existed and that the fair value of all reporting units to
which goodwill is allocated is well in excess of the respective carrying value.

Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments
affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and
financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international
pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment
about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in
the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax
assets. An increase in



the
valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Any changes in a valuation allowance that was
established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision.

Changes
in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we
conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related
interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and
related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax
payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the
ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised
by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income
tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. These tax liabilities and related interest
are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our defined benefit pension and
postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the
measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation, which represents the
actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents
the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trust funds.
Mandatory contribution amounts are actuarially determined; voluntary contributions are at our discretion. The benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors, such as
years of service and compensation.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

Two
critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at
least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual
results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the
expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations.
A 25 basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate would



have
increased or decreased, respectively, the present value of our pension obligations by $107 million at fiscal year end 2011. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our
pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2011 pension expense by
$10 million.

During
fiscal 2008, our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. plans' master trust from 60% equity and 40% fixed income to 30%
equity and 70% fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations. The target asset allocation transition began in fiscal 2008. Asset
reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based on the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. As of September 30, 2011, our actual asset
allocation is approximately 35% equity and 65% fixed income.

Share-Based Compensation

We determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The
Black-Scholes-Merton model requires certain assumptions that involve judgment. Such assumptions are the expected share price volatility, expected annual dividend yield, expected life of options, and
risk-free interest rate. (See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to share-based compensation.) An increase in the volatility of our
stock will increase the amount of share-based compensation expense on new awards. An increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in share-based compensation expense. Dividend
yields and risk-free interest rates are less difficult to estimate, but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in share-based compensation expense and an increase in the
risk-free interest rate will increase share-based compensation expense.

Acquisitions

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting for acquired
businesses requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquired
businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We may engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such
valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

Critical
estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from customer and distributor relationships, acquired developed
technologies, and patents; expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed; brand
awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio; customer and distributor attrition rates; and discount
rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from
estimates.



Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an update to guidance in ASC 805,

Business Combinations

, that clarifies the disclosure requirements for pro forma presentation of revenue and earnings related to a business combination.
We elected to early adopt this guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810,

Consolidation

, that address accounting for variable interest
entities. We adopted these updates to ASC 810 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2011, the FASB issued an update to guidance in ASC 350,

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other

, that introduces the
use of qualitative factors when considering the need to perform a step I goodwill
impairment test on one of our reporting units. If we conclude that qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value, we do not
need to perform a step I goodwill impairment test on that reporting unit. This update to ASC 350 is effective for us in fiscal 2013; however, we intend to early adopt the standard
during fiscal 2012. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
June 2011, the FASB issued an update to guidance in ASC 220,

Comprehensive Income

, that changes the presentation and
disclosure requirements of comprehensive income in interim and annual financial statements. These updates to ASC 220 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Adoption is
not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
May 2011, the FASB issued an update to guidance in ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement

, that clarifies the application of
fair value and enhances disclosure regarding valuation of financial instruments and level 3 fair value measurement inputs. These updates to ASC 820 are effective for us in the second quarter of
fiscal 2012. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic Net Sales Growth

Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most
comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, divestitures, and an additional week
in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It
excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company,
such as acquisition and divestiture activity and the impact of an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length.

We
believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it
provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying
results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations
of our reporting segments



and
our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and analysis of organic net
sales growth in Results of Operations above utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net
sales growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not meant
to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best
addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in Results of Operations above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net
sales growth calculated under GAAP.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities
(the most comparable GAAP measure) and free cash flow (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. Free cash flow
is a useful measure of our cash generation which is free from any significant existing obligation. It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. Free cash flow permits
management and investors to gain insight into the amount that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation.

Free
cash flow excludes net capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, and the cash impact of special items. Net capital expenditures are subtracted because they represent
long-term commitments. Voluntary pension contributions are subtracted from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity.
Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters and pre-separation litigation payments, are also considered by management in evaluating free
cash flow. We believe investors should also consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow.

Free
cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that
have an impact on our GAAP cash flow. Also, it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the board of directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or
more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using free cash flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow results.

The
tables presented in Liquidity and Capital Resources above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under GAAP.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated
with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management
policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks.

We
do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are
limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 credit rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty.

Foreign Currency Exposures

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize foreign currency forward and swap contracts,
a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
intercompany transactions, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other cash transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the September 30, 2011 market rates would have
decreased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $19 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar would have increased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by
$24 million. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from
the September 24, 2010 market rates would have decreased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $12 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar would have increased
the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $15 million. Such gains or losses on these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the
underlying transactions.

Interest Rate and Investment Exposures

We issue debt, from time to time, to fund our operations and capital needs. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To
manage the interest rate exposure and to minimize overall interest cost, we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. We use
forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps ("swaptions") to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate
debt. We also utilize interest rate swap contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges, to manage interest rate and earnings exposure on cash and cash equivalents and certain
non-qualified deferred compensation liabilities.

During
fiscal 2011, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on $150 million principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes that mature
in 2021 to manage interest rate exposure. The maturity dates of the interest rate swaps coincide with the maturity date of the notes. Under these contracts, we receive fixed amounts of interest
applicable to the underlying notes and pay a floating amount based upon the three month U.S. Dollar London interbank offered rate.

During
fiscal 2010, we purchased swaptions and entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure prior to the probable issuance of
fixed-rate debt when our 6.00% senior notes mature in 2012. The swaptions and forward starting interest rate swaps are based on a total notional amount of $400 million. Also during
fiscal 2010, we entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge on $50 million principal amount of the 6.00% senior notes.

Based
on our floating rate debt balance of $202 million at September 30, 2011, an increase in the levels of the U.S. Dollar interest rates by 0.5%, with all other variables
held constant, would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately $1 million. Based on our floating



rate
debt balance of $150 million at September 24, 2010, an increase in the levels of the U.S. Dollar interest rates by 0.5%, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted
in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately $1 million.

Commodity Exposures

Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of
fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we utilize commodity swap contracts, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges. We continually evaluate the
commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage
requirements over that period. At September 30, 2011, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold and silver, were in a loss position of $1 million and had a
notional value of $211 million. At September 24, 2010, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold and silver, were in a gain position of $12 million and had
a notional value of $108 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold and a troy ounce of silver from the September 30, 2011 prices would have
changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $21 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold and a troy ounce of silver from the
September 24, 2010 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $12 million.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2011. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2011.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2011.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2011, which is included in this Annual Report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended September 30, 2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ADC Acquisition

We acquired ADC on December 8, 2010. We have extended our annual assessment of the effectiveness of the internal controls over
financial reporting and our Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of September 30, 2011 to include ADC.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TE Connectivity Ltd.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2011 and September 24,
2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2011. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2011 and
September 24, 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2011, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 18, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TE Connectivity Ltd.:

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2011, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, and our report dated November 18, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global company that designs and manufactures approximately 500,000
products that connect and protect the flow of power and data inside millions of products used by consumers and industries. We partner with customers in a broad array of industries from consumer
electronics, energy, and healthcare to automotive, aerospace, and communication networks.

Company Name Change

In March 2011, our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of association to change our name from "Tyco
Electronics Ltd." to "TE Connectivity Ltd." The name change was effective March 10, 2011. Our ticker symbol "TEL" on the New York Stock Exchange remained unchanged.

Change of Domicile

Effective June 25, 2009, we discontinued our existence as a Bermuda company as provided in Section 132G of the Companies
Act of 1981 of Bermuda, as amended, and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued our existence as a Swiss corporation under
articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations (the "Change of Domicile"). The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss
organizational regulations.

The Separation

Tyco Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of then Bermuda-based Tyco
International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). Effective June 29, 2007, we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International. On June 29, 2007, Tyco
International distributed all of our shares, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (the "separation").

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of TE Connectivity Ltd. and its subsidiaries and have
been prepared in United States Dollars in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in
these Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges, assets acquired and liabilities assumed, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash flows
and discount rates associated with asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories,
estimated contract revenue and related costs, legal contingencies, tax reserves and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension
and postretirement employee benefit expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation (Continued)

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate entities in which we own or control more than fifty percent of the voting shares or otherwise have the ability to
control through similar rights. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included on the Consolidated Financial Statements from the
effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

Description of the Business

We consist of three reportable segments:

•

Transportation Solutions.

The Transportation Solutions
segment is a leader in electronic components, including connectors, relays, circuit protection devices, wire and cable, heat shrink tubing, and sensors, as well as application tooling and
custom-engineered solutions for the automotive and aerospace, defense, and marine markets.

•

Communications and Industrial Solutions.

The
Communications and Industrial Solutions segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of electronic components, including connectors, relays, touch screens, circuit protection devices, antennas, and
heat shrink tubing. Our products are used primarily in the industrial machinery, data communications, household appliance, consumer devices, computer, and touch solutions markets.

•

Network Solutions.

The Network Solutions segment is one of
the world's largest suppliers of infrastructure components and systems for the telecommunications and energy markets. Our products include connectors, heat shrink tubing, wire and cable, racks and
panels, fiber optics, and wireless products. We are also a leader in developing, manufacturing, installing, and maintaining some of the world's most advanced subsea fiber optic communications systems.

Fiscal Year

Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009 are to our
fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, and September 25, 2009, respectively. Our fiscal year is a "52-53 week" year ending on the last
Friday of September, such that each quarterly period is 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will include
14 weeks. Fiscal 2011 was a 53 week year. Fiscal 2010 and 2009 were each 52 weeks in length.

Reclassifications

We have reclassified certain items on our Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the current year presentation.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title
and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

and
determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue.

Contract
revenues for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are
based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs.
Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they
first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become
determinable. Contract revenues for construction related projects are generated primarily in the Network Solutions segment.

We
generally warrant that our products will conform to our or mutually agreed to specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for
a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We accept returned goods only when the customer makes
a verified claim and we have authorized the return. Returns result primarily from defective products or shipping discrepancies. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based
on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Additionally,
certain of our long-term contracts in the Network Solutions segment have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty costs for each contract are determined based
on the contract terms and technology-specific considerations. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the construction period of the respective contracts under
percentage-of-completion accounting.

We
provide certain distributors with an inventory allowance for returns or scrap equal to a percentage of qualified purchases. A reserve for estimated returns and scrap allowances is
established at the time of the sale based on a fixed percentage of sales to distributors authorized and agreed to by us and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Other
allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is
recorded as a reduction of sales. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate the amounts of future allowances.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in research, development, and engineering expenses.
Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred, and building and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $624 million,
$482 million, and $439 million, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in our outstanding receivables
based on fixed percentages applied to aging categories, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, and other currently available information.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market value, except for inventoried
costs which are costs incurred in the performance of long-term contracts primarily by the Network Solutions segment.

Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net and Long-Lived Assets

Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to
expense when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

5 to 40 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of remaining term of the lease or economic useful life

Machinery and equipment

1 to 15 years

We periodically evaluate, when events and circumstances warrant, the net realizable value of long-lived assets, including property,
plant, and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When
indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset group are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the
underlying asset group. Impairment in the carrying value of an asset group is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are estimated to be less than its
carrying value. The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the
amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a
determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are
amortized generally on a straight-line basis. See Note 9 for additional information regarding intangible assets. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with
a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our
policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each
reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing
the existence of a triggering event, management relies



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

on
a number of reporting unit specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent
uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

At
fiscal year end 2011, we had 10 reporting units, of which 8 contained goodwill. See Note 8 for information regarding goodwill impairment testing. When changes occur in the
composition of one or more operating segments or reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its
carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment
loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill
exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount
of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the
reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Estimates
about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting
unit. The income
approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates,
income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill
impairments in future periods.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740,

Income Taxes

. The benefits
of a consolidated return have been reflected where such returns have or could be filed based on the entities and
jurisdictions included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected on the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss
carryforwards using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, and derivative
financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

equivalents,
accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximated book value as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. See Note 11 for disclosure of the fair value of
debt, Note 14 for disclosures related to derivative financial instruments, and Note 15 for additional information on fair value measurements.

We
account for derivative financial instrument contracts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. For instruments not designated as hedges under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, the changes in
the instruments' fair value are recognized currently in earnings. For instruments designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
underlying hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions, including amounts excluded from the
hedging relationship, of a cash flow hedge are recognized currently in earnings. Changes in the fair value of instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or
liability hedged, with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability being recognized in earnings.

We
determine the fair value of our financial instruments by using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. Standard
market conventions are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives.

The
cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Our
derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks; however, concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated as we deal with financial institutions
worldwide, substantially all of which have long-term Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, only conventional derivative financial
instruments are utilized. We are exposed to potential losses if a counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of its agreement. With respect to counterparty net asset positions recognized at
September 30, 2011, we have assessed the likelihood of counterparty default as remote. We currently provide guarantees from a wholly-owned subsidiary to the counterparties to our commodity swap
derivatives. The likelihood of performance on those guarantees has been assessed as remote. For all other derivative financial instruments that we enter into at this time, we are not required to
provide, nor do we require counterparties to provide, collateral or other security.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the
projected benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit
plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already
rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of
participants, which are invested by the trust funds. Mandatory contribution amounts are



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

actuarially
determined; voluntary contributions are at our discretion. The benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

The
measurement of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on estimates and assumptions determined by our management. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans
and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age, and years of service, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of
compensation increases, interest crediting rates, and mortality rates.

Share-Based Compensation

We determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant. Share options are valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation
model; restricted share awards are valued using the end-of-day share price of TE Connectivity on the date of grant. That fair value is expensed ratably over the expected
service period, with an allowance made for estimated forfeitures based on historical employee activity. See Note 22 for additional information related to share-based compensation.

Currency Translation

For our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using
fiscal year end exchange rates. Sales and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the fiscal year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income within equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, which are included in earnings, were immaterial in fiscal 2011 and 2010. Such losses were $71 million during fiscal
2009.

Acquisitions

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting for acquired
businesses requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquired
businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We may engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such
valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. We include the results of operations of an acquired company in our
Consolidated Statement of Operations from the date of acquisition.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an update to guidance in ASC 805,

Business Combinations

, that
clarifies the disclosure requirements for pro forma presentation of revenue and earnings related to a business combination.
We elected to early adopt this



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

guidance
during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810,

Consolidation

, that address accounting for variable interest entities. We
adopted these updates to ASC 810 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2011, the FASB issued an update to guidance in ASC 350,

Intangibles—Goodwill and
Other

, that introduces the use of qualitative factors when considering the need to perform a step I goodwill impairment test on one of our reporting units. If we conclude that
qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value, we do not need to perform a step I goodwill impairment test on that
reporting unit. This update to ASC 350 is effective for us in fiscal 2013; however, we intend to early adopt the standard during fiscal 2012. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
June 2011, the FASB issued an update to guidance in ASC 220,

Comprehensive Income

, that changes the presentation and disclosure
requirements of comprehensive income in interim and annual financial statements. These updates to ASC 220 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Adoption is not expected to have a
material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
May 2011, the FASB issued an update to guidance in ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement

, that clarifies the application of fair value and
enhances disclosure regarding valuation of financial instruments and level 3 fair value measurement inputs. These updates to ASC 820 are effective for us in the second
quarter of fiscal 2012. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fiscal 2011 Actions

We initiated restructuring programs during fiscal 2011 which were primarily associated with the acquisition of ADC and related
headcount reductions in the Network Solutions segment. Additionally,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net (Continued)

we
increased reductions in force as a result of current economic conditions, primarily in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment. In connection with these actions, during fiscal 2011, we
recorded net restructuring charges of $168 million primarily related to employee severance and benefits. We expect to complete all restructuring activities commenced in fiscal 2011 by the end
of fiscal year 2012 and to incur additional charges of approximately $6 million, primarily in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment. Cash spending related to this plan was
$67 million in fiscal 2011. We expect cash spending to be approximately $103 million and $16 million in fiscal 2012 and 2013, respectively.

During
fiscal 2011, in connection with the acquisition of ADC, we assumed $16 million of liabilities related to employee severance and exited lease facilities which have been
included in the Network Solutions segment. We expect to incur additional charges of $2 million relating to these actions.

Fiscal 2010 Actions

We initiated restructuring programs during fiscal 2010 primarily relating to headcount reductions in the Transportation Solutions
segment. In connection with these actions, during fiscal 2011 and 2010, we recorded net restructuring credits of $16 million and charges of $64 million, respectively, primarily related
to employee severance and benefits. The credits in fiscal 2011 related primarily to decreases in planned employee headcount reductions associated with the Transportation Solutions segment. We have
completed all restructuring activities commenced in fiscal 2010. Cash spending related to this plan was $18 million in fiscal 2011, and we expect cash spending to be approximately
$12 million in fiscal 2012.

of our manufacturing simplification plan. In connection with these actions, during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded net restructuring credits of $8 million, charges of
$3 million, and charges of $255 million, respectively, primarily related to employee severance and benefits. The credits in fiscal 2011 related primarily to decreases in planned employee
headcount reductions in the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. We have completed all restructuring activities commenced in fiscal 2009. Cash spending
related to this plan was $17 million in fiscal 2011, and we expect cash spending to be approximately $6 million in fiscal 2012, with spending completed by fiscal 2013.

Pre-fiscal 2009 Actions

We initiated restructuring programs during fiscal 2008 primarily relating to the migration of product lines to lower-cost
countries and the exit of certain manufacturing operations in the Transportation Solutions and Network Solutions segments. In connection with these actions, during fiscal 2011 and 2010, we recorded
net restructuring credits of $5 million and charges of $6 million, respectively. Also, during fiscal 2009, we recorded net restructuring charges of $55 million, primarily related
to employee severance and benefits, including $31 million of changes in estimate primarily associated with the exit of a European manufacturing operation in the Transportation Solutions
segment. We have completed all restructuring activities commenced in fiscal 2008.

During
fiscal 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $779 million primarily related to a significant downturn in the telecommunications industry and certain other end markets.
These actions have been completed. As of fiscal year end 2011, the remaining restructuring reserves related to the fiscal 2002 actions were $31 million, relating to exited lease facilities in
the Subsea Communications business in the Network Solutions segment. We expect that the remaining reserves will continue to be paid out over the expected terms of the obligations which range from one
to fifteen years. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $1 million, $1 million, and $7 million, respectively, for interest accretion on these
reserves.

Restructuring and Related Non-Cash Charges and Credits

During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded non-cash charges of $9 million, $5 million and
$35 million, respectively, primarily related to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets in connection with exited manufacturing facilities and product lines.

Loss on Divestitures and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

During fiscal 2010, we sold our mechatronics business for net cash proceeds of $3 million. This business designed and
manufactured customer-specific components, primarily for the automotive industry, and generated sales of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2010. In connection with the sale, we recorded a
pre-tax loss on sale of $41 million in the Transportation Solutions segment in fiscal 2010.

During
fiscal 2009, our board of directors authorized management to pursue the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line which was part of our energy business in
the Network Solutions segment. The product line generated sales of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009. Based on an estimated sales price, we determined that the carrying value of the
product line's assets and liabilities was in excess of its fair value. A pre-tax impairment charge of $12 million was recorded in fiscal 2009 to write the carrying value of the
assets and liabilities down to fair value. During fiscal 2010, we completed the sale of the product line for net cash proceeds of $12 million. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a
pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets and a pre-tax loss on sale totaling $13 million in fiscal 2010.

During
fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Battery Systems business, which was part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment, for net cash proceeds of
$14 million after working capital adjustments. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $7 million in fiscal 2009.

The
loss on divestitures and impairment charges are presented in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have presented the loss on
divestitures, related long-lived asset impairments, and operations of the mechatronics business, Dulmison connectors and fittings product line, and Battery Systems business in continuing
operations due to immateriality.

4. Discontinued Operations

In fiscal 2010, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in connection with the favorable resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to
the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007.

In
fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Wireless Systems business for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on the
transaction. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds of $29 million and recognized an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the
finalization of working capital adjustments related to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which were sold in fiscal 2008.

for fiscal 2009 included $68 million relating to the impact of $319 million of goodwill written off in connection with the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business, for which a tax
benefit was not fully realized, as well as $35 million of unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax
provision on the Power Systems business as a result of the finalization of the tax basis of assets sold upon the filing of the fiscal 2008 income tax returns.

The
Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Automotive Radar Sensors, Power Systems, and Printed Circuit Group businesses met the held for sale and discontinued
operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued
operations, the Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses were components of the former Wireless Systems segment. The Power Systems and
Printed Circuit Group businesses were components of the former Other segment.

5. Acquisitions

Fiscal 2011 Acquisitions

In July 2010, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire 100% of the outstanding stock of ADC
Telecommunications, Inc. ("ADC"), a provider of broadband communications network connectivity products and related solutions. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer
through a subsidiary to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of ADC common stock at a purchase price of $12.75 per share in cash followed by a merger of the subsidiary with and into ADC,
with ADC surviving as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary. On December 8, 2010, we acquired 86.8% of the outstanding common shares of ADC. On December 9, 2010, we exercised our option
under the Merger Agreement to purchase additional shares from ADC that, when combined with the shares purchased in the tender offer, were sufficient to give us ownership of more than 90% of the
outstanding ADC common shares. On December 9, 2010, upon effecting a short-form merger under Minnesota law, we owned 100% of the outstanding shares of ADC for a total purchase price
of approximately $1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of

$546 million)
and $22 million representing the fair value of ADC share-based awards exchanged for TE Connectivity share options and stock appreciation rights.

Based
on the terms and conditions of ADC's share option and stock appreciation right ("SAR") awards (the "ADC Awards"), all ADC Awards became exercisable upon completion of the
acquisition. Each outstanding ADC Award was exchanged for approximately 0.4 TE Connectivity share options or SARs and resulted in approximately 3 million TE Connectivity share
options being issued with a weighted-average exercise price of $38.88. Issued SARs and the associated liability were insignificant. The fair value associated with the exchange of ADC Awards for
TE Connectivity awards was approximately $24 million based on Black-Scholes-Merton pricing valuation model, of which $22 million was recorded as consideration given in the
acquisition while the remaining $2 million was recorded as acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during fiscal 2011.

The
acquisition was made to accelerate our growth potential in the global broadband connectivity market. We have realized and expect additional cost savings and other synergies through
operational efficiencies. ADC's businesses are reported as part of the Network Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

The
ADC acquisition was accounted for under the provisions of ASC 805,

and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. We completed the valuation of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of

Other current assets included trade accounts receivable of $171 million, inventories of $166 million, and deferred income taxes of
$16 million. Other current assets also included assets held for sale of $109 million. Those assets were sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 for net proceeds of
$111 million, of which approximately $106 million was received prior to September 30, 2011. Other current liabilities assumed were primarily comprised of accrued and other current
liabilities of $165 million and trade accounts payable of $88 million.

The
fair values assigned to intangible assets were determined through the use of the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty, multi-period excess earnings, and avoided cost
methods. These valuation methods rely on management judgment, including expected future cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships, customer attrition rates, contributory effects of
other assets utilized in the business, peer group cost of capital and royalty rates, and other factors. The valuation of tangible assets was derived using a combination of the income, market, and cost
approaches. Significant judgments used in valuing tangible assets include estimated reproduction or replacement cost, useful lives of assets, estimated selling prices, costs to complete, and
reasonable profit.

Useful
lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining useful economic lives of the intangible assets that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to
future cash flows.

The acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected lives. The $366 million of
goodwill is attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The goodwill recognized is attributable
primarily to cost savings and other synergies related to operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing, marketing, and general and administrative functions. All of the goodwill
has been allocated to the Network Solutions segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. However, prior to its merger with us, ADC completed certain acquisitions that resulted in goodwill
deductible for U.S. tax purposes of approximately $346 million which we will deduct over the next ten years.

During
the period from December 9, 2010 to September 30, 2011, ADC contributed net sales of $964 million and an operating loss of $59 million to our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operating loss included restructuring charges of $82 million, charges of $41 million associated with the amortization of acquisition
accounting-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, integration costs of $10 million, and acquisition costs of $9 million.

future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2009.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we acquired a business for $14 million in cash. The acquisition was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The assets
acquired, primarily definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, are reported as part of the Transportation Solutions segment.

Fiscal 2010 Acquisitions

On January 20, 2010, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Sensitive Object, an early-stage software
company engaged in developing touch-enabling technology focused on computers, mobile devices, and consumer electronics, for a purchase price of approximately $61 million in cash (net of cash
acquired of $6 million), including contingent consideration of $6 million paid in fiscal 2011 upon completion of certain service requirements by key Sensitive Object managers.

The
Sensitive Object acquisition complements our existing Touch Solutions business, which is primarily focused on commercial and industrial markets. Sensitive Object is reported as part
of the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

their expected lives. Due to immateriality, no amounts were allocated to in-process research and development.

The
fair values assigned to intangible assets were determined through the use of the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings and avoided cost methods. These
valuation methods rely on management judgment, including expected future cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships, customer attrition rates, contributory effects of other assets
utilized in the business, peer group cost of capital and royalty rates, and other factors.

Approximately
$51 million has been allocated to goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Factors contributing to the recognized goodwill are low revenue levels in the years immediately following the acquisition reflecting the early-stage status of Sensitive Object's
technology and the amount of future investment required to develop commercially viable products. Goodwill related to this acquisition is reported in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment
and is not deductible for tax purposes.

Pro
forma information is not presented as the impact of the Sensitive Object acquisition on our Consolidated Statements of Operations is not material.

On
August 6, 2010, we acquired the remaining outstanding equity interests of PlanarMag, Inc. ("PlanarMag") for $23 million in cash and the forgiveness of an
approximate $1 million loan payable. Prior to the acquisition, we owned approximately 14% of PlanarMag. The acquisition was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The net assets
acquired, which are not material, are reported as part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment. The excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired of $25 million has
been allocated to goodwill in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. Factors contributing to the goodwill recognized include the early-stage status
of PlanarMag's business and technology, minimal revenue, and lack of customer relationships.

On

During fiscal 2011, we completed the acquisition of ADC and recognized $366 million of goodwill, all of which benefits the Network
Solutions segment. We completed the acquisitions of Sensitive Object and PlanarMag during fiscal 2010. The Sensitive Object and PlanarMag acquisitions resulted in the recognition of $51 million
and $25 million, respectively, of goodwill that benefits the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment. See Note 5 for additional information on the acquisitions of ADC, PlanarMag,
and Sensitive Object.

We
test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances exist that indicate that a reporting unit's carrying value
may exceed its fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and determined that no impairment existed.

As
a result of declines in sales and profitability in the Automotive reporting unit of the Transportation Solutions segment and the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Circuit
Protection reporting units of the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred and goodwill
impairment testing of these reporting units was required. Significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. In making this assessment, management relied on a
number of reporting unit specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. There are inherent uncertainties related to these
factors and management's judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill.

8. Goodwill (Continued)

The
testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process. In performing step I of impairment testing, we determined the fair value of the Automotive, Communications and Industrial
Solutions, and Circuit Protection reporting units based on a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating our estimate of future operating performance. The results of the step I goodwill impairment
tests indicated that the carrying amount of each of the reporting units exceeded its fair value. The failure of the step I goodwill impairment tests triggered step II goodwill impairment tests in
which we determined the implied fair value of the reporting units' goodwill by comparing the reporting units' fair value determined in step I to the fair value of the reporting units' net assets,
including unrecognized intangible assets. The step II goodwill impairment tests resulted in a full impairment charge, as of the second quarter of fiscal 2009, of $2,088 million for the
Automotive reporting unit and partial impairment charges of $1,347 million and
$112 million for the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Circuit Protection reporting units, respectively.

All
goodwill impairment charges are presented in impairment of goodwill on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

notes into cash. See Note 5 for more information on the ADC acquisition. In December 2010, our ADC subsidiary commenced offers to purchase $650 million aggregate principal amount of the
convertible subordinated notes at par plus accrued interest, pursuant to the terms of the indentures for the notes. The offers to purchase expired in January 2011. Promptly thereafter,
$198 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2013, $55 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2015, and $218 million
principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2017 were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of $471 million. All of the convertible subordinated notes purchased by ADC have
been cancelled.

In
March 2011, in connection with an internal reorganization related to the acquisition of ADC, our ADC subsidiary commenced offers to purchase $177 million aggregate principal
amount of its convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and 2017 at par plus accrued interest, pursuant to the terms of the indentures for the notes. The offers to purchase expired in April 2011.
Promptly thereafter, $81 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and $7 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2017 were
purchased for an aggregate purchase price of $89 million. All of the convertible subordinated notes purchased by ADC have been cancelled. Our debt balance at fiscal year end 2011 included the
remaining $90 million of 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and $2 million of floating rate convertible subordinated notes due 2013.

On
June 24, 2011, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"), with total commitments of $1,500 million, and
terminated its then existing five-year senior unsecured credit agreement, which at the time of termination had total commitments of $1,425 million and was scheduled to mature on
April 25, 2012. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at September 30, 2011. Also, TEGSA had no borrowings under its then existing facility at September 24, 2010.

Borrowings
under the Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable
margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Deutsche Bank AG New York branch's base
rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus


/


of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior,
unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30.0 basis points based upon the amount of the lenders' commitments under
the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA.

The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit
Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four

consecutive
fiscal quarters exceeds 3.5 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary
covenants.

During
June 2009, TEGSA commenced a tender offer to purchase up to $150 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, up to $100 million principal amount of
its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and up to $100 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037. On July 7, 2009, the tender offer expired and on July 9, 2009, TEGSA
purchased and cancelled $86 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $42 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $23 million principal
amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037 for an aggregate payment of $141 million, plus paid accrued interest through July 7, 2009 of $3 million to the sellers of the notes. As
a result of the transaction, in fiscal 2009, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million, which is included in other income, including the write-off of unamortized
discounts and fees of $1 million and the recognition of a gain of $12 million associated with terminated interest rate swaps previously designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, as
a result of the re-purchase and cancellation, unamortized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income of $3 million related to terminated forward starting interest rate swaps
designated as cash flow hedges were recognized as interest expense.

Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are backed by the Credit Facility. TEGSA made no borrowings during fiscal 2011 and had no commercial paper outstanding at fiscal year end 2011. As of fiscal year end 2010, TEGSA had
$100 million of commercial paper outstanding at an interest rate of 0.55%.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by TE Connectivity Ltd. Neither TE
Connectivity Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries provides a guarantee as to payment obligations under notes issued by ADC prior to its acquisition in December 2010.

We
have used, and continue to use, derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. See Note 14 for information on options to enter into interest rate swaps ("swaptions"),
forward starting interest rate swaps, and interest rate swaps.

The
fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $2,970 million and $2,680 million at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010, respectively.

12. Guarantees

Separation and Distribution Agreement

Upon separation, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with Tyco International and Covidien to
effect the separation and provide a framework for our relationships with Tyco International and Covidien after the distribution of our and Covidien's shares to Tyco International's shareholders. These
agreements govern the relationships among Tyco International, Covidien, and us subsequent to the separation and provide for the allocation to us and Covidien of certain of Tyco International's assets,
liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to the separation.

Under
the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien assumed
31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other
corporate liabilities are shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to consolidated securities litigation and any actions with respect to the
separation or the distribution brought by any third party. If any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated
to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities, including associated costs and expenses.

Tax Sharing Agreement

Upon separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which we share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's,
and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. We, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of
U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to
indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

12. Guarantees (Continued)

indemnifications
to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. All costs
and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax
Sharing
Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

All
of the tax liabilities of Tyco International that were associated with Tyco International subsidiaries that are included in TE Connectivity following the separation became our tax
liabilities upon separation. Although we have agreed to share certain tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we remain primarily liable for all of
these liabilities. If Tyco International and Covidien default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such
liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed upon share of our, Tyco International's,
and Covidien's tax liabilities.

Indemnification

Our indemnification created under the Tax Sharing Agreement qualifies as a guarantee of a third party entity's debt under ASC 460,

Guarantees

. ASC 460 addresses the measurement and disclosure of a guarantor's obligation to pay a debt incurred by a third party. To value the initial
guarantee obligation, we considered a range of probability-weighted future cash flows that represented the likelihood of payment of each class of liability by each of the three
post-separation companies. The expected cash flows incorporated interest and penalties that the companies believed would be incurred on each class of liabilities and were discounted to the
present value to reflect the value associated with each at separation. The calculation of the guarantee liability also included a premium that reflected the cost for an insurance carrier to stand in
and assume the payment obligation at the separation date.

At
inception of the guarantee, based on the probability-weighted future cash flows related to unresolved tax matters, we, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, faced a maximum potential
liability of $3 billion, based on undiscounted estimates and interest and penalties used to determine the fair value of the guarantee and an assumption of 100% default on the parts of Tyco
International and Covidien, a likelihood that management believes to be remote. In the event that we are required, due to bankruptcy or other business interruption on the part of Tyco International or
Covidien, to pay more than the contractually determined 31%, we retain the right to seek payment from the effected entity.

At
September 30, 2011, we had a liability representing the indemnifications made to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement of $249 million of
which $228 million was reflected in other liabilities and $21 million was reflected in accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2011, we had
net cash payments to Tyco International and Covidien of $90 million related to our indemnifications under the Tax Sharing



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

12. Guarantees (Continued)

Agreement.
At September 24, 2010, the liability was $339 million and consisted of $205 million in other liabilities and $134 million in accrued and other current
liabilities. The amount reflected in accrued and other current liabilities is our estimated cash obligation under the Tax Sharing Agreement to Tyco International and Covidien in connection with
pre-separation tax matters that could be resolved within one year.

We
have assessed the probable future cash payments to Tyco International and Covidien for pre-separation income tax matters pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement
and determined that $249 million remains sufficient to satisfy these expected obligations.

Other Matters

In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including
unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and
manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
September 30, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $436 million, of which $50 million was related to our contract
with the State of New York (the "State"). As disclosed in Note 13, in January 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. As a
result, we recorded a pre-tax charge equal to the draw. Although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so, the State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million
against the standby letter of credit which could result in additional charges and could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, except for the potential claims related to the contract
with the State
discussed above, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

We
generally record estimated product warranty costs when contract revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method for construction related
contracts and at the time of sale for products. The estimation is primarily based on historical experience and actual warranty claims. Amounts accrued for warranty claims at fiscal year end 2011 and
2010 were $60 million and $47 million, respectively. We do not consider these amounts to be material.

TE Connectivity Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims,
product liability matters, employment disputes, tax matters, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, and antitrust claims. Although it is not feasible to predict the
outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these
proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Legal Matters under Separation and Distribution Agreement

The Separation and Distribution Agreement among us, Tyco International, and Covidien provided for the allocation among the parties of
Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to our and Covidien's separations from Tyco International on June 29, 2007. Under the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, we assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters at separation related to our business or assumed or retained liabilities. We were
responsible for 31% of certain liabilities that arose from litigation pending or threatened at separation that was not allocated to one of the three parties, and Tyco International and Covidien were
responsible for 27% and 42%, respectively, of such liabilities. If any party defaults in payment of its allocated share of any such liability, each non-defaulting party will be responsible
for an equal portion of the amount in default together with any other non-defaulting party, although any such payments will not release the obligation of the defaulting party. Subject to
the terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco International manages and controls all the legal matters related to the shared contingent liabilities, including the defense
or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. All costs and expenses that Tyco International incurs in connection with the



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

defense
of such litigation, other than the amount of any judgment or settlement, which is allocated in the manner described above, will be borne equally by Tyco International, Covidien, and us. At the
present time, all significant matters for which we shared responsibility with Tyco International and Covidien under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which as previously reported in our
periodic filings generally related to securities class action cases and other securities cases, have been settled. Other than matters described below under "Compliance Matters," we presently are not
aware of any additional legal matters which may arise for which we would bear a portion of the responsibility under the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, prior to the separation, Tyco International and certain of its former directors and officers were named as defendants in over 40 purported
securities class action lawsuits. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to the securities class actions were allocated among Tyco
International, Covidien, and us. We were responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that arose upon the resolution of the litigation pending at the time of separation.

During
fiscal 2010, Tyco International settled the remaining significant securities lawsuit, a class action captioned

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al.

, for $79 million. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, our share of the settlement amount was $24 million. We had
previously established reserves for this case in fiscal 2009. As a result of the settlement of the

Stumpf

case, we concluded that reserves of
$22 million could be released. Accordingly, pursuant to the sharing formula, we recorded income of $7 million during fiscal 2010. As of September 30, 2011, there were no remaining
securities lawsuits outstanding.

During
fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $144 million for our share of Tyco International's settlements of several securities cases and our portion of the estimated probable
loss for the then remaining securities litigation claims, including the

Stumpf

case, subject to the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in our periodic filings, Tyco International received and has responded to various allegations that certain
improper payments were made by Tyco International subsidiaries, including our subsidiaries, in recent years prior to the separation. Tyco International reported to the U.S. Department of Justice and
the Securities and Exchange Commission the investigative steps and remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations, including that it retained outside counsel to perform a
company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls, and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), and that it would continue to investigate
and make periodic progress reports to these agencies. To date, our baseline review has revealed that some of our former business practices may not have complied with FCPA requirements. At this time,
we believe we have adequate amounts recorded related to these matters, the amounts of which are not significant. Any judgment, settlement, or other cost incurred by Tyco International in connection
with these matters not specifically allocated to Tyco International, Covidien, or us would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Income Taxes

In connection with the separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Covidien's, and Tyco
International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result
of any failure of the distribution of all of our
shares or the shares of Covidien to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the
"Code") or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities
relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us
with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of
certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to
default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. We are responsible for all of our own
taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the
Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

Prior
to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by
various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as
the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax
contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes,

which relate
specifically to our entities, have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco International's tax obligations.
Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 12 for additional information.

In
prior years, in connection with the IRS audit of various fiscal years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns
resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. The IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the IRS had completed its field
work. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we have determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2006 is more likely than not to be accepted and,
accordingly, have recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
fiscal 2009, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and in connection with these adjustments, we recorded a
$97 million increase in



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

income
tax liabilities, a $10 million increase in deferred tax assets, a $60 million increase in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in connection with the Tax Sharing
Agreement, and a $27 million charge to contributed surplus. See Note 12 for additional information regarding the indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien.

As
our tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to separation, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. While
the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed and accepted by the IRS, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact
on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Additionally, adjustments may be recorded to equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income tax returns in
certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and/or our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the separation.

During
fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent
Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Tyco International has appealed certain proposed adjustments totaling approximately
$1 billion. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers
of stock in 1998 and 1999. Based upon statutory guidelines, Tyco International estimates the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. The penalty is asserted
against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that was distributed to us in connection with the separation. Any penalty ultimately imposed upon our subsidiary would be subject to sharing with Tyco
International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. It is our understanding that Tyco International continues to make progress towards resolving a substantial number of the proposed tax
adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000; however, several significant matters remain in dispute. The remaining issues in dispute involve the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt
transactions. Tyco International has indicated that it is unlikely to achieve the resolution of these contested adjustments through the IRS appeals process, and therefore may be required to litigate
the disputed issues. For those issues not remaining in dispute, it is likely that Tyco International will settle with the IRS and pay any related deficiencies within the next twelve months. Over the
next twelve months, we expect to pay approximately $90 million, inclusive of related indemnification payments, in connection with pre-separation tax matters.

During
fiscal 2011, the IRS completed its field examination of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, issued Revenue Agent Reports which reflect
the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004 period, and issued certain notices of deficiency. As a result of the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain
tax matters in fiscal 2011, we recognized income tax benefits of $35 million and other expense of $14 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement. For a portion of these
pre-separation deficiencies, we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for which we paid $132 million in fiscal 2011. Concurrent
with remitting these payments, we were reimbursed $93 million from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters. In addition, we
paid a total of $115 million in fiscal 2011 to Tyco International and Covidien for our share of 2001 through 2004 pre-separation tax deficiencies for which Tyco International and
Covidien are the primary obligors to the taxing authorities. As a result, our net cash payment attributable to these matters was $154 million in fiscal 2011.

The
IRS commenced its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

During fiscal 2009, Tyco International settled a matter with the IRS concerning certain tax deductions claimed on Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004.
As a result of this settlement, we recorded a $28 million income tax charge in fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions.

At
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, we have reflected $232 million and $244 million, respectively, of income tax liabilities related to the audits
of Tyco International's and our income tax
returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within one year.

We
continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is
uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Environmental Matters

We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The
ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative
cleanup methods. As of fiscal year end 2011, we concluded that it was probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of $12 million to $24 million. As of fiscal year end 2011,
we concluded that the best estimate within this range is $13 million, of which $5 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $8 million is included in other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters of $13 million, we believe that any potential payment of such estimated
amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Matters Related to Our Former Wireless Systems Business

Certain liabilities and contingencies related to our former Wireless Systems business were retained by us when this business was sold
in fiscal 2009. These include certain retained liabilities related to the State of New York contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the acquisition of Com-Net by the
Wireless Systems business in 2001. See additional information below. Also, see Note 4 for additional information regarding the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business.

State of New York Contract

In September 2005, we were awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State of New York to construct, operate, and
maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. In August 2008, we were served by the State with a default notice related to the first regional
network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the State. In October 2008, we informed the State that all
technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing. The State conducted further testing
during November and December 2008. In January 2009, the State notified us that, in the State's opinion, we had not fully remediated the issues cited by the State and it had determined that we were in
default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State in conjunction

with
the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, in January 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. The
State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit, although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so.

In
February 2009, we filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including breach of contract,
unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State terminated the
contract "for convenience." In September 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claim and a claim for breach of
warranty in connection with the State's drawdown on the $50 million letter of credit. In November 2009, the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract
and alleging that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. We moved to dismiss the counterclaim in February 2010, and in June 2010 the Court denied our motion. We filed our
answer to the State's counterclaim in July 2010. We believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter. A trial date has been set for February
2012.

As
a result of these actions, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $111 million associated with this contract. These charges are
reflected in loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of our sale of the Wireless Systems business. See Note 4 for further discussion of
discontinued operations and the sale of the Wireless Systems business. The charges included an impairment charge of $61 million to write-off all costs incurred in constructing the
network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the State against the standby letter of credit of $50 million.

Com-Net

At September 30, 2011, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001
acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system
for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not
believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania,
which is in the discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably
estimable at this time.

14. Financial Instruments

We use derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, investment, and commodity risks.

Foreign Exchange Risks

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize foreign currency forward and swap contracts,
a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The

objective
of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, and other cash transactions.

We
expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the cash flow hedge-designated instruments addressing foreign exchange risks
will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the next twelve months.

Interest Rate and Investment Risk Management

We issue debt, from time to time, to fund our operations and capital needs. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To
manage the interest rate exposure and to minimize overall interest cost, we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. We use
forward starting interest rate swaps and swaptions to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt. We also utilize interest rate swap
contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges, to manage interest rate and earnings exposure on cash and cash equivalents and certain non-qualified deferred compensation
liabilities.

During
fiscal 2011, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on $150 million principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes. The maturity dates of the
interest rate swaps coincide with the maturity date of the notes. Under these contracts, we receive fixed amounts of interest applicable to the underlying notes and pay a floating amount based upon
the three month U.S. Dollar LIBOR.

During
fiscal 2010, we purchased swaptions and entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure prior to the probable issuance of four year term
fixed-rate debt when our 6.00% senior notes mature in 2012. The swaptions are based on a total notional amount
of $200 million; the forward starting interest rate swaps are also based on a total notional amount of $200 million. Both swaptions and forward starting interest rate swaps were
designated as cash flow hedges of the probable interest payments. Premiums of $6 million paid to enter into the swaptions are recognized as interest expense over the term of the swaptions. The
effective portion of swaptions and forward starting interest rate swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized in earnings as interest expense over the term of the
anticipated debt issuance.

During
fiscal 2010, we entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge on $50 million principal amount of the 6.00% senior notes. The maturity date of the
interest rate swaps coincides with the maturity date of the underlying debt. Under this contract, we receive fixed rates of interest applicable to the underlying debt and pay floating rates of
interest based on the one month U.S. Dollar LIBOR.

During
fiscal 2009, we terminated interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on $300 million principal amount of the 6.55% senior notes and $200 million principal
amount of the 6.00% senior notes. Prior to the termination, the interest rate swaps were marked to fair value, resulting in premiums of $49 million and $14 million associated with the
6.55% senior notes and 6.00% senior notes, respectively. The premiums are recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the life of the respective notes.

We
utilize interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to manage interest rate exposure on a notional amount of $40 million of cash and cash equivalents. Ineffectiveness is
recognized in interest

income.
The effective portion of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in earnings as interest income over the
term of the instrument. Ineffective amounts recognized in earnings were not material in fiscal 2011 and 2010. The fair value of the contracts and the amounts recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income were not material at September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. No such contracts existed during fiscal 2009.

We
utilize swaps to manage exposure related to certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation liabilities. The notional amount of the swaps was $30 million and
$19 million at September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. The swaps act as economic hedges of changes in a portion of the liabilities. Both the change in value of
the swap contracts and the non-qualified deferred compensation liabilities are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Commodity Hedges

As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow
hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production.

At
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, our commodity hedges had notional values of $211 million and $108 million, respectively. We expect that
significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the commodities hedges will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the next
twelve months.

Hedges of Net Investment

We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany non-derivative financial instruments
denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $1,542 million and $1,672 million at September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010,
respectively. We reclassified foreign exchange losses of $70 million, $25 million, and $72 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These amounts were recorded as
currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses attributable to the translation of the net investment. See Note 21 for
additional information.

Certain
forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were terminated in September 2007. Terminated forward starting interest rate
swaps resulted in losses of $5 million, $5 million, and $9 million reflected in interest expense in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Forward starting interest rate swaps
in place at September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010 resulted in losses of $9 million and $12 million, respectively, in other comprehensive income related to the effective
portions of the hedge during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest rate swaptions in place at September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010 resulted in no gains or losses in other

During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we incurred gains of $7 million, gains of $18 million, and losses of $178 million,
respectively, as a result of marking foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to fair value. Fiscal 2011 and 2010 gains were largely offset by losses realized as a result of
re-measuring the underlying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to primarily the Euro or U.S. Dollar. Fiscal 2009 losses were primarily related to changes in certain
Eastern European currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and were largely offset by the gains realized as a result of re-measuring the underlying assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies to primarily the Euro or U.S. Dollar.

15. Fair Value Measurements

Guidance on fair value measurement in ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

, specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the
observability of the inputs utilized in valuation of certain assets and liabilities. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs
(lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:

•

Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

•

Level 2—Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

•

Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flows methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis:

•

Commodity swap contracts—Fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using quoted prices on
futures exchanges (level 1).

•

Interest rate swaps and swaptions—Fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined based on observable
inputs other than quoted prices. The positions are primarily valued using market approach models that use readily observable interest rates as their basis (level 2).

•

Investment swap contracts—Fair value of these assets is determined based on observable inputs other than
quoted prices. The positions are primarily valued using market approach models that use readily observable equity returns as their basis (level 2).

•

Foreign currency contracts—Fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using the market approach.
Values are based on observable market transactions of spot and forward currency rates (level 2).

•

Rabbi trust assets—Rabbi trust assets are principally comprised of comingled equity funds that are marked to
fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (level 1) and fixed income securities that are marked to fair value based on quoted market prices or other pricing determinations
based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market data such as recently reported trades, bid and offer information, and benchmark securities (level 2).

The
majority of derivatives that we enter into are valued using the over-the-counter quoted market prices for similar instruments. We do not believe that fair
values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity.

As
of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, we did not have significant financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring
basis or non-financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value.

During
fiscal 2010, we used significant other observable inputs (level 2) to calculate a $12 million impairment charge related to the Dulmison connectors and fittings
product line sold during fiscal 2010 for $12 million. See Note 3 for additional information.

from time to time. We anticipate that, at a minimum, we will make the minimum required contributions to our pension plans in fiscal 2012 of $3 million for U.S. plans and $97 million for
non-U.S. plans.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

We maintain several defined contribution retirement plans, the most significant of which is located in the U.S., which include 401(k)
matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution
plans is computed as a percentage of participants' compensation and was $65 million, $56 million, and $55 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans and Rabbi Trusts

We maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A
record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

16. Retirement Plans (Continued)

The
measurement funds correspond to a number of funds in our 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Total deferred compensation liabilities were
$67 million and $49 million at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 14 for additional information regarding our risk management strategy related to
deferred compensation liabilities.

Additionally,
we have established rabbi trusts, related to certain acquired companies, through which the assets may be used to pay non-qualified plan benefits. The trusts
primarily hold bonds and equities. The rabbi trust assets are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of our insolvency; plan participants are general creditors of ours with respect to
these benefits. The value of the assets held by these trusts, included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $84 million at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010. Total
liabilities related to the assets held by the rabbi trust and reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $18 million and $19 million at fiscal year end 2011
and 2010, respectively, and include certain deferred compensation liabilities (referred to above), split dollar life insurance policy liabilities, and an unfunded pension plan in the U.S. Plan
participants are general creditors of ours with respect to these benefits.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, we also provide certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees

Our
investment strategy for our postretirement benefit plans is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk. The plan is invested in debt
securities, which are considered level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, and equity securities, which are considered level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, and targets an allocation of 50% in
each category.

We
expect to make contributions to our postretirement benefit plans of $2 million in fiscal 2012.

The tax provision for fiscal 2011 reflects income tax benefits recognized in connection with profitability in certain entities operating in
lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions. In addition, the provision for fiscal 2011 reflects income tax benefits of
$35 million associated with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S. tax matters.

The
tax provision for fiscal 2010 reflects charges of $307 million primarily associated with certain proposed adjustments to prior year income tax returns and related
accrued interest partially offset by income tax benefits of $101 million recognized in connection with the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns.
The charges of $307 million and the income tax benefits of $101 million are reflected in change in accrued income tax liabilities in fiscal 2010 in the reconciliation above. In
addition, the provision for fiscal 2010 reflects an income tax benefit of $72 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss
carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations.

The
tax provision for fiscal 2009 was impacted by the $3,547 million pre-tax impairment of goodwill for which a partial tax benefit of $523 million was
recorded, a $144 million pre-tax charge related to pre-separation securities litigation for which a partial tax benefit of $25 million was recorded, a
$28 million charge related to the settlement of a tax matter (see Note 13 for additional information), and a $24 million detriment related to a $68 million
pre-tax expense recognized pursuant to our Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. See Notes 13 and 18 for additional information regarding the Tax Sharing
Agreement. Additionally, as discussed further below, the

fiscal 2009
tax provision included adjustments related to prior years tax returns, including a $49 million tax benefit reflected in change in accrued income tax liabilities in the
reconciliation above.

During
fiscal 2009, in connection with the IRS examination of our 2001 through 2004 U.S. federal income tax returns, certain favorable adjustments were identified
and presented to the IRS. These adjustments resulted in a net $49 million tax benefit included in the tax provision, a $42 million increase to deferred tax assets, and a
$7 million reduction of income tax liabilities. We concluded these items were not material to current or prior years financial statements and, accordingly, recorded them during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2009.

Deferred
income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The components of the net
deferred income tax asset at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010 were as follows:

Tax loss and credit carryforwards decreased primarily due to the utilization of operating loss carryforwards in fiscal 2011. Included in
the decrease was $536 million related to the taxable appreciation of investments in subsidiaries in certain taxing jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was reduced in fiscal 2011 by a
corresponding $536 million.

Tax
loss and credit carryforwards increased $503 million and the valuation allowance increased $260 million in fiscal 2011 as a result of our acquisition of ADC. The
valuation allowance was provided for certain ADC tax attributes due to the uncertainty of their realization in the future. The U.S. federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards we
acquired in connection with the ADC acquisition are subject to various annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

17. Income Taxes (Continued)

At
fiscal year end 2011, we had approximately $1,632 million of U.S. federal and $141 million of U.S state net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) which will
expire in future years through 2031. In addition, at fiscal year end 2011, we had approximately $149 million of U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, of which $38 million
have no expiration and $111 million will expire in future years through 2031, and $41 million of U.S. state tax credits carryforwards which will expire in future years
through 2026. At fiscal year end 2011, we also had $71 million of U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards (tax effected) expiring through 2016.

At
fiscal year end 2011, we had approximately $1,518 million of net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of which
$1,229 million have no expiration and $289 million will expire in future years through 2031. Also, at fiscal year end 2011, there were $3 million of non-U.S.
tax credit carryforwards of which $2 million have no expiration and $1 million will expire in future years through 2025. In addition, $23 million of non-U.S.
capital loss carryforwards (tax effected) have no expiration.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,930 million and $2,236 million at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010, respectively, relates principally to
the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient
future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the
provisions of ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that
all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. At fiscal year end 2011, approximately $56 million of the valuation allowance relates to share-based compensation and will
be recorded to equity if certain net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are utilized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our
operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss
carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be
applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and
circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related
interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest
liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement,
income tax benefits may be recognized.

We
have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in
fiscal 2012. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for
temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or
we have concluded that no additional tax



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

17. Income Taxes (Continued)

liability
will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 30, 2011, certain subsidiaries had approximately $17 billion of undistributed earnings that we
intend to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries
are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.

Uncertain Tax Position Provisions of ASC 740

As of September 30, 2011, we had total unrecognized tax benefits of $1,783 million. If recognized in future periods,
$1,684 million of these currently unrecognized tax benefits would impact the income tax provision and effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2010, we had total unrecognized tax benefits
of $1,689 million. If recognized in future periods, $1,603 million of these unrecognized tax benefits would impact the income tax provision and effective tax rate. The following table

was recorded in income taxes and $133 million was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized $86 million,
$231 million, and $82 million, respectively, of interest and penalties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 24, 2010, the balance of accrued interest and
penalties was $1,252 million of which $1,119 million was recorded in income taxes and $133 million was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities.

In

in the process of appealing certain tax adjustments proposed by the IRS related to this period. During fiscal 2011, the IRS completed its field examination of certain Tyco International income
tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 and issued Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004

In most jurisdictions, taxing authorities retain the ability to review prior tax years and to adjust any net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards from these years that are utilized in a subsequent period.

Although
it is difficult to predict the timing or results of certain pending examinations, it is our understanding that Tyco International continues to make progress towards resolving a
substantial number of proposed tax adjustments for the audit cycles of 1997 through 2000; however, several significant matters remain in dispute. The remaining issues in dispute involve
the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. Tyco International has indicated that it is unlikely to achieve the resolution of these contested adjustments through the IRS appeals
process, and therefore may be required to litigate the disputed issues. For those issues not remaining in dispute, it is likely that Tyco International will settle with the IRS and pay any related
deficiencies within the next twelve months. While the ultimate resolution is uncertain, based upon the current status of these examinations, we estimate that up to approximately $200 million of
unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the impacts relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.

17. Income Taxes (Continued)

We
are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
September 30, 2011.

18. Other Income (Expense), Net

In fiscal 2011, we recorded net other income of $27 million, primarily consisting of income pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien.
During fiscal 2011, we recorded other expense of $14 million in connection with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S. tax matters. See additional information in
Note 13. Also, see Note 12 for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement.

In
fiscal 2010, we recorded net other income of $177 million, primarily consisting of income pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. The
income in fiscal 2010 reflects a net increase to the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien primarily related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period income tax returns and
related accrued interest, partially offset by a decrease related to the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns.

In
fiscal 2009, we recorded net other expense of $48 million, primarily consisting of $68 million of expense pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco
International and Covidien and a $22 million gain on the retirement of debt. The $68 million of expense is attributable to a net reduction of the receivable from Tyco International and
Covidien primarily as a result of the settlement of various matters with the IRS. See Note 11 for additional information regarding the gain on retirement of debt.

19. Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. by the basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for
potentially dilutive unexercised share options and non-vested restricted share awards. The following table sets forth the denominators of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share
computations:

Certain share options were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the instruments' underlying exercise
prices were greater than the average market prices of TE Connectivity's common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive. Such shares not included in the computation were 13 million,
16 million, and 20 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

19. Earnings (Loss) Per Share (Continued)

As
a result of our loss during fiscal 2009, non-vested restricted share awards and unexercised options to purchase TE Connectivity's common shares with underlying exercise
prices less than the average market prices were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as inclusion of these share awards and options would have been antidilutive. Share awards and
options not included in the computation were 1 million for fiscal 2009.

20. Equity

Change of Domicile

Effective June 25, 2009, we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. In connection with the Change
of Domicile and in accordance with the laws of Switzerland, the par value of our common shares increased from $0.20 per share to 2.60 Swiss Francs ("CHF") per share (or $2.40 based on an exchange rate
in effect on June 22, 2009). The Change of Domicile was approved at a special meeting of shareholders held on June 22, 2009. The following steps occurred in connection with the Change of
Domicile, which did not result in a change to total Equity:

•

the par value of common shares was increased from $0.20 to CHF 2.60 through a 1-for-12
reverse share split, followed by the issuance of 11 fully paid bonus shares so that the same number of shares were outstanding before and after the Change of Domicile but with an increased par value
per share, which reduced contributed surplus by $1.1 billion with a corresponding increase to common shares;

•

the cancellation of approximately 32 million shares held in treasury;

•

the elimination of share premium with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus, all of which was designated as
freely distributable reserves for Swiss corporate and tax law purposes; and

•

the elimination of 125 million authorized preferred shares, none of which were issued and outstanding.

Common Shares

As a result of the adoption of our articles of association in connection with the Change of Domicile but prior to the distributions to
shareholders discussed under "Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders" below, our ordinary share capital was $1,124 million with 468 million registered common shares and a par value
of CHF 2.60 (or $2.40 based on an exchange rate in effect on June 22, 2009). Subject to certain conditions specified in the articles of association, we are authorized to increase our
share capital by issuing new shares in aggregate not exceeding 50% of our authorized shares. Additionally, in March 2011, our shareholders reapproved and extended through March 9, 2013 our
board of directors' authorization to issue additional new shares, subject to certain conditions specified in the articles, in aggregate not exceeding 50% of the amount of our authorized shares.
Although we state our par value in Swiss Francs, we continue to use the U.S. Dollar as our reporting currency for preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

20. Equity (Continued)

Common Shares Held in Treasury

At September 30, 2011, approximately 39 million common shares were held in treasury, of which 15 million were
owned by one of our subsidiaries. At September 24, 2010, approximately 25 million common shares were held in treasury, of which 21 million were owned by one of our subsidiaries.
Shares held both directly by us and by our subsidiary are presented as treasury shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In
March 2011, our shareholders approved the cancellation of 5,134,890 shares held in treasury purchased under our share repurchase program during the period from July 27, 2010 to
December 24, 2010. The capital reduction by cancellation of these shares was subject to a notice period and filing with the commercial register and became effective in May 2011.

Contributed Surplus

Contributed surplus originally established during the Change of Domicile for Swiss tax and statutory purposes ("Swiss Contributed
Surplus"), subject to certain conditions, is a freely distributable reserve. As of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, Swiss Contributed Surplus was $8,940 million
(equivalent to CHF 9,745 million) and $9,273 million (equivalent to CHF 10,059 million), respectively.

Upon
our implementation of recently enacted Swiss tax law regarding the classification of Swiss Contributed Surplus for Swiss tax and statutory purposes, distributions to shareholders
from Swiss Contributed Surplus will be free from withholding tax. We are in discussions with Swiss tax authorities regarding certain administrative aspects of the law related to the classification of
Swiss Contributed Surplus for tax and statutory reporting purposes. Should we not be successful in our discussions, we may need to formally enter into an appeal process in order to gain a favorable
ruling. Should we not gain favorable resolution, we may be required to make certain statutory reclassifications to Swiss Contributed Surplus that likely will limit our ability to make distributions
free of withholding tax in future years and may negatively impact our ability to repurchase our shares in future years.

Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders

Under Swiss law, subject to certain conditions, distributions to shareholders made in the form of a reduction of registered share
capital or from reserves from capital contributions (equivalent to Swiss Contributed Surplus) are exempt from Swiss withholding tax. See "Contributed Surplus" for additional information regarding our
ability to make distributions free from withholding tax from contributed surplus. Distributions or dividends on our shares must be approved by our shareholders.

On
June 22, 2009, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.17 per
share. During the quarter ended September 25, 2009, the distribution was paid in U.S. Dollars at a rate of $0.16 per share. This capital reduction reduced the par value of our common shares
from CHF 2.60 (equivalent to $2.40) to CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24).

In
October 2009, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.34 (equivalent to
$0.32) per share, payable in two equal installments in each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. We paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share
each during the quarters



TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

20. Equity (Continued)

ended
December 25, 2009 and March 26, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24) to CHF 2.09 (equivalent
to $1.92).

In
March 2010, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.72 (equivalent to
$0.64) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 through the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We paid the first and second installments of the
distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended June 25, 2010 and September 24, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from
CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92) to CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60). We paid the third and fourth installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters
ended December 24, 2010 and March 25, 2011. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60) to CHF 1.37 (equivalent
to $1.28).

In
March 2011, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.68 (equivalent to $0.72) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly
installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 through the second quarter of fiscal 2012 to shareholders of record on specified dates in each of the four quarters. We paid the first and
second installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.18 per share each during the quarters ended June 24, 2011 and September 30, 2011.

Upon
approval by the shareholders of a dividend payment or cash distribution in the form of a capital reduction, we record a liability with a corresponding charge to contributed surplus
or common shares.

At
September 30, 2011, the unpaid portion of the dividend payment approved in March 2011, CHF 0.34 (equivalent to $0.36) per share, was recorded in accrued and other
current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The unpaid portion of the distribution approved in March 2010, CHF 0.36 (equivalent to $0.32) per share, was recorded in accrued and other
current liabilities at September 24, 2010.

Share Repurchase Program

During fiscal 2011, our board of directors authorized a total increase in the share repurchase authorization of $2,250 million,
of which $750 million was authorized in the first quarter and $1,500 million was authorized in the fourth quarter. We purchased approximately 25 million of our common shares for
$867 million, approximately 18 million of our common shares for $488 million, and approximately 6 million of our common shares for $125 million during fiscal 2011,
2010, and 2009, respectively. At September 30, 2011, we had $1,501 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

22. Share Plans

Significantly all equity awards (restricted share awards and share options) granted by us subsequent to separation were granted under the Tyco Electronics Ltd. 2007 Stock and
Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan is administered by the management development and compensation committee of our board of directors, which consists exclusively
of independent directors and provides for the award of share options, stock appreciation rights, long-term performance awards, restricted units, deferred stock units, restricted shares,
promissory shares, and other share-based awards (collectively, "Awards"). As of September 30, 2011, the 2007 Plan provided for a maximum of 40 million common shares to be issued as
Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2007 Plan. Subsequent to the acquisition of ADC, we registered an additional 7 million shares related to ADC equity incentive
plans (collectively the "ADC Plans"). Both the 2007 Plan and the ADC Plans allow for the use of authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to be used to satisfy such awards. As of
September 30, 2011, we had 11 million shares available under the 2007 Plan and 4 million shares available under the ADC Plans.

Prior
to the separation on June 29, 2007, all equity awards held by our employees were granted by Tyco International under Tyco International equity incentive plans. Based on the
grant date, type of award, and employing company, awards converted from Tyco International to TE Connectivity awards in different manners. As a result of the conversion, all TE Connectivity restricted
share awards granted to employees of Tyco International and Covidien are fully vested. Approximately 1 million of vested options to purchase our common shares are held by current or former
employees of Tyco International and Covidien. All share option award conversions were done in accordance with Sections 409A and 424 of the Code.

22. Share Plans (Continued)

Share-Based Compensation Expense

Share-based compensation expense during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 totaled $74 million, $64 million, and
$53 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense in continuing operations was primarily included in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Share-based compensation expense of $2 million has been included within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax for fiscal 2009. We have recognized a related tax
benefit associated with our share-based compensation arrangements of $22 million, $19 million, and $13 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Restricted Share Awards

Restricted share awards are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under
the 2007 Plan and the ADC Plans. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement or normal retirement requirements, all or a
portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, whereas
recipients of restricted units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents. We currently grant restricted unit awards only. For grants that vest based on certain specified performance
criteria, the fair value of the shares or units is expensed over the period of performance, once achievement of criteria is deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair
value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the closing value of our shares on the
grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest in increments over a period of four years as determined by the management development and compensation committee, or upon attainment of various
levels of performance that equal or exceed targeted levels, if applicable.

As
of fiscal year end 2011, there was $87 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted share awards. The cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.

All
non-vested restricted share awards held by ADC employees fully vested upon our acquisition of ADC, as stipulated in the original terms and conditions of the awards. As a
result, all ADC restricted share awards vested, and were fully expensed by ADC, prior to the acquisition.

Share Options

Share options are granted to purchase our common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of the common
shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2007 Plan or the ADC Plans. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon death or
disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement or normal retirement requirements, all or a portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular
grant. Options generally vest and become exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of four years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant.

The weighted-average exercise price of share option awards granted during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $33.86, $24.72, and $14.44,
respectively.

As
of fiscal year end 2011, there was $37 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share options granted under our share option plans. The cost
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.

All
share options and stock appreciation right ("SAR") awards related to ADC were converted into share options and SARs related to our common shares. The conversion factor was the tender
offer price of $12.75 per share divided by the volume weighted-average share price for our common shares for the 10-day period preceding the acquisition. The terms and conditions of the
original grants included change-of-control provisions that accelerated vesting. As a result of those provisions, all ADC share options and SARs vested, and were fully expensed
by ADC, prior to conversion to awards based on our common shares. The number of converted SARs outstanding and the associated liability were insignificant at September 30, 2011.

As
a result of the exchange of ADC Awards for our share options and SARs, we recognized $2 million of incremental share-based compensation expense during fiscal 2011. Those costs,
which are

included
in the total share-based compensation expense above, are presented in acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Share-Based Compensation Assumptions

The grant-date fair value of each share option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Use
of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the
stock of a composite of our peers and implied volatility derived from exchange traded options on that same composite of peers. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option
and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a
remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on our expected dividend rate. The share-based compensation expense
recognized was net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 and the weighted-average assumptions we used in the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows:

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2011 and 2010 was $50 million and $13 million, respectively; the total
intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2009 was insignificant. We received cash related to the exercise of options of $80 million, $12 million, and $1 million in
fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows was
not significant.

23. Segment and Geographic Data

We operate through three reporting segments: Transportation Solutions, Communications and Industrial Solutions, and Network Solutions. Effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we
reorganized our management and segments to align the organization around our strategy. Our businesses in the former Specialty Products Group—Aerospace, Defense, and Marine; Medical;
Circuit Protection; and Touch Solutions—have been moved into other segments. Also, the former Subsea Communications segment and the businesses associated with ADC, acquired on
December 8, 2010, have been included in the Network Solutions segment. The former Transportation Connectivity segment

was
renamed Transportation Solutions during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the acquisition of ADC. See Note 1 for a description of the
segments in which we operate. We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based upon similar economic characteristics and our internal business structure.

Segment
performance is evaluated based on net sales and operating income. Generally, we consider all expenses to be of an operating nature, and, accordingly, allocate them to each
reportable segment. Costs specific to a segment are charged to the segment. Corporate expenses, such as headquarters administrative costs, are allocated to the segments based on segment operating
income. Pre-separation litigation charges (income) were not allocated to the segments. Intersegment sales were not material and were recorded at selling prices that approximate market
prices. Corporate assets are allocated to the segments based on segment assets.
