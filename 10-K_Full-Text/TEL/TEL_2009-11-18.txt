PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("we," "Tyco Electronics," or the "Company") is a leading global provider of engineered electronic
components, network solutions, specialty products, and undersea telecommunication systems. We design, manufacture, and market products for customers in a broad array of industries including
automotive; data communication systems and consumer electronics; telecommunications; aerospace, defense, and marine; medical; energy; and lighting. Our products are produced in nearly 100
manufacturing sites in approximately 25 countries. With approximately 7,000 engineers and worldwide manufacturing, sales, and customer service capabilities, Tyco Electronics' commitment is our
customers' advantage.

Tyco
Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). For the period following
its incorporation, Tyco Electronics Ltd. did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets. Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its
shares of Tyco Electronics to its common shareholders (referred to in this report as the "separation"). Tyco Electronics Ltd. became an independent, publicly traded company owning the former
electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd. In connection with the separation, the equity interests in the entities that hold all of the assets and liabilities of Tyco International's
electronics businesses were transferred to Tyco Electronics.

Our
business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions, from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2002, of established electronics companies and divisions, including the acquisition
of AMP Incorporated and Raychem Corporation in fiscal 1999 and the Electromechanical Components Division of Siemens and OEM Division of Thomas & Betts in fiscal 2000. These companies each have
more than 50 years of history in engineering and innovation excellence. We operated as a segment of Tyco International prior to our separation.

Effective
June 25, 2009, we discontinued our existence as a Bermuda company as provided in Section 132G of The Companies Act of 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the "Bermuda
Companies Act"), and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued our existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of
the Swiss Code of Obligations. The rights of holders of our shares are now governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

We
operate through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Undersea Telecommunications. In May 2009, we sold our Wireless
Systems business which has been reclassified as discontinued operations. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued operations, this business was reported as our former Wireless
Systems segment. Also, effective January 1, 2009, we established the Specialty Products Group from our existing businesses. The results of this new organization are reported as a separate
reporting segment. This new segment is comprised of the Aerospace, Defense, and Marine; Touch Systems; Medical; and Circuit Protection
businesses which were formerly reported in the Electronic Components segment. Prior period segment information has been revised to conform to the current segment reporting structure in all periods
presented. See Notes 1 and 24 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments.



Our
reporting segments manufacture and distribute our products and solutions to a number of end markets. The table below provides a summary of our reporting segments, the fiscal 2009 net

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

•

Global leader in passive components.

With net sales of
approximately $10.3 billion in fiscal 2009, we are significantly larger than many of our competitors. In the fragmented connector industry, which was estimated to be $34 billion in
fiscal 2009, our net sales were approximately $6 billion. We have established a global leadership position in the connector industry with leading market positions in the following
markets:

•

Automotive—#1

•

Industrial—#1

•

Computers and peripherals—#2

•

Telecom/data communications—#3

Our
scale provides us the opportunity to accelerate our sales growth by making larger investments in existing and new technologies in our core markets and to expand our presence in emerging markets.
Our leadership position also provides us the opportunity to lower our purchasing costs by developing lower cost sources of supply and to maintain a flexible manufacturing footprint worldwide that is
close to our customers' locations.

•

Strong customer relationships.

As an industry leader, we
have established close working relationships with our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical
solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we are able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation
technology across our products.



In
addition, we operate a broad Global Account Management program through which we maintain close working relationships with the key customers in the end markets that we serve.

•

Process and product technology leadership.

We employ
approximately 7,000 engineers dedicated to product research, development, and engineering. Our investment of over $530 million in product and process engineering and development together with
our capital spending of over $300 million in fiscal 2009, enable us to consistently provide innovative, high-quality products with efficient manufacturing methods.

•

Diverse product mix and customer base.

We manufacture and
sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back
many years. We believe that this diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to particular end markets, thereby
reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our
competitors.

•

Balanced geographic sales mix.

We have an established
manufacturing presence in approximately 25 countries and our sales are global. Our global coverage positions us near our customers' locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply
base and lowering their production costs. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile. In addition, our strategy is to
continue to increase the percentage of production from lower-cost countries.

•

Strong and experienced management team.

We believe we have
a management team that has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our Chief Executive Officer and segment leaders average more
than 20 years of experience of which most is in the electronics industry. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team that is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our
position as a global leader in the industry.

Our Strategy

Our goal is to be the world leader in providing custom-engineered electronic components and solutions for an increasingly connected
world. We believe that in achieving this goal we will increase net sales and profitability across our segments in the markets that we serve. Our business strategy is based upon the following
priorities:

•

Leverage our market leadership position to increase our market
share.

We are a global leader in many of the markets that we serve. For example, within our Electronic Components segment, we are the
leading global supplier of connectors and connector systems to the automotive and industrial markets. We believe that these and other markets are critical to our success and that we must continue to
strengthen our leadership position in these markets. We plan to capitalize on the expected long-term growth in these markets by leveraging our significant scale in the industry, the
breadth of our product portfolio, our established relationships and leading specification positions with our customers, and our extensive worldwide distribution channels.

•

Achieve market leadership in attractive and under-penetrated
industries.

We plan to accelerate growth in end-user markets in which we do not have the number one market share but which
we believe have attractive growth and profitability characteristics. These markets include: the alternate energy and lighting markets with respect to our Electronic Components segment; the energy,
communication service providers, and enterprise networks markets with respect to our Network Solutions segment; and the aerospace, defense, and marine, touch systems, and medical markets with respect
to our Specialty Products segment. We believe that we can further leverage



our
customer service and our new product and technology capabilities in order to achieve a leading position in these markets.

•

Extend our leadership in key emerging markets.

We seek to
improve our market leadership position in emerging geographic regions, including China, Eastern Europe, and India, which we expect will experience higher growth rates than those of more developed
regions in the world. In fiscal 2009, we generated $1.4 billion of net sales in China, $0.7 billion of net sales in Eastern Europe, and $0.2 billion of net sales in each of India
and Brazil. We believe that expansion in these regions will enable us to grow faster than the overall global market.

•

Supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions.

We
will evaluate and selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that strengthen our market position, enhance our existing product offering, enable us to enter attractive markets, expand our technological
capabilities, and provide synergy opportunities.

•

Improve operating margins.

We intend to continue to
increase our productivity and reduce our manufacturing costs. We plan to achieve this by developing best in class manufacturing, enhancing our purchasing strategy through design initiatives and
sourcing of materials from suppliers in lower-cost regions, simplifying our distribution network, and further implementing best practice continuous improvement programs. We also plan to
continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, both by migrating facilities from higher-cost to lower-cost countries and by consolidating within countries. With
respect to our manufacturing rationalization plan, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $350 million through 2011 related to current as well as future restructuring
actions. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry.

•

Accelerate new product development through research and development
excellence.

We seek to continue to increase the percentage of our annual net sales from new products. In fiscal 2009, we derived approximately 31% of our net sales from new
products launched within the previous three years. In order to accomplish this goal, we intend to focus our research, development, and engineering investment on next generation technologies and highly
engineered products and platforms, and leverage innovation across our segments.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing
know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents
and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and
monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We
own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and
trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is
obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

While
we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations
are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.



Employees

As of September 25, 2009, we employed approximately 78,000 people worldwide, of whom 20,000 were in the Americas region, 23,000
were in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, and 35,000 were in the Asia-Pacific region. Of our total employees, approximately 46,000 were employed in manufacturing and 18,000 were
represented by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 60% of our employees were based in lower-cost countries, primarily China. We believe that our relations with our employees
are satisfactory.

Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the United States and other countries. A small portion of our products,
including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and
other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import
and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

Environmental

We are committed to complying with all applicable environmental, health, and safety laws and to the protection of our employees and the
environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards, staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues, periodic
compliance auditing, training, and other measures. We have a program for compliance with the European Union ("EU") Restriction on Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronics Equipment
Directives, the China RoHS law, and similar laws.

We
have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon
our experience, current information and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $13 million to $26 million. As of
September 25, 2009, we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately $16 million.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks described
below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to risks that affect many other companies, such as general economic conditions, geopolitical events, competition, technological
obsolescence, labor relations, and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations, financial
condition, and liquidity.

Risks Relating to Our Business

Current and future conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, and cyclical industry conditions, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows.

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. As a result of global
economic trends, the credit market crisis, lower consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, and other challenges currently affecting the global economy, our customers may
experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products
and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Further, our vendors may be experiencing similar conditions, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to
us. If the global economic slowdown continues for significant periods or deteriorates significantly, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely
affected.

Additionally,
we are heavily dependent on the end market industry dynamics for our products, and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand patterns
of these markets. Our sales are dependent on certain end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be adversely affected by
reduced demand in those markets. For example, the automotive industry, which accounted for approximately 27% of our net sales in fiscal 2009, is experiencing a significant downturn described below.
The telecommunications industry, which accounted for approximately 27% of our net sales in fiscal 2009, has historically experienced periods of robust capital expenditure followed by periods of
retrenchment and consolidation, which reflects current market conditions. The aerospace and defense industry, which accounted for 6% of our net sales in fiscal 2009, has similarly undergone
significant fluctuations in demand, depending on worldwide economic and political conditions. These periodic downturns in our customers' industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our
products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are dependent on the automotive industry which is experiencing significant declines in the current economic environment.

Approximately 27% of our net sales for fiscal 2009 were to customers in the automotive industry. Automotive manufacturers globally are
experiencing significant declines in sales of vehicles from the current economic downturn and credit conditions. Additionally, the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can
exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively
affected by changes in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as well as potential
consolidations among automotive manufacturers.



We are dependent on the telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics industries.

Approximately 27% of our net sales for fiscal 2009 came from sales to the telecommunications industry. Demand for these products is
subject to rapid technological change and has been affected by declines in consumer and business spending due to global economic conditions. Additionally, these markets are dominated by several large
manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the telecommunications industry, and
our failure to do so would materially impair our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Approximately
7% of our net sales for fiscal 2009 came from sales to the computer and consumer electronics industries. Demand for our computer and consumer electronics products depends
primarily on underlying business and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products, which has been affected by reduced spending due to global economic conditions. The amount of
this demand and therefore our sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors, including the rate of technological change, degree of consumer acceptance of new products, and general
economic conditions. We cannot assure you that existing levels of business and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products will not decrease.

Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding.

The global equity markets have been volatile and credit markets globally have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of
investment capital and credit. If these conditions continue or worsen, we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to
generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash
flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions.

We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry.

We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components. The competition we experience across product lines from other
companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has continued to become increasingly concentrated and
globalized in recent years, and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some
instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products. We cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against
existing or new competitors.

Recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill could negatively affect our results of operations.

We test goodwill allocated to reporting units for impairment annually during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if events
occur or circumstances exist that indicate that a reporting unit's carrying value may exceed its fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and
determined that no impairment existed.

Significant
judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including, among others, operating
results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. There are inherent



uncertainties
related to these factors and management's judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill.

During
the second quarter of fiscal 2009, as a result of declines in sales and profitability of the Automotive and Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting units of the
Electronic Components segment and the Circuit Protection reporting unit of the Specialty Products segment, we determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred and goodwill impairment testing of
these reporting units was required. The testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process. In performing step I of impairment testing, we determined the fair value of the Automotive,
Communications and Industrial Solutions, and Circuit Protection reporting units based on a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating our estimate of future operating performance. The results of the
step I goodwill impairment tests indicated that the book value of each of the reporting units exceeded its fair value. The failure of the step I goodwill impairment tests triggered step II goodwill
impairment tests in which we determined the implied fair value of the reporting units' goodwill by comparing the reporting units' fair value determined in step I to the fair value of the reporting
units' net assets, including unrecognized intangible assets. The step II goodwill impairment tests resulted in a full impairment charge of $2,088 million for the Automotive reporting unit and
partial impairment charges of $1,347 million and $112 million for the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Circuit Protection reporting units, respectively, in the second quarter
of fiscal 2009.

Should
economic conditions deteriorate further or remain depressed for a prolonged period of time, estimates of future cash flows for our reporting units may be insufficient to support
carrying value and the goodwill assigned to it, requiring us to perform additional tests for impairment. Further impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial
position.

We are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue growth.

The markets in which we operate are subject to rapid technological change. Our long-term operating results depend
substantially upon our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain
products to meet customer requirements. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we
will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands.

Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices.

Over the past several years we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, pressure each year to lower our prices. In
recent years, we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1% to 2%. In order to maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot assure you that continuing
pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate.

Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become
increasingly concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, telecommunications, computer, and aerospace and defense industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product
purchases from us. In addition, as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, and they have been able to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative
sources from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their



ability
to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our products, particularly for commodity components.

Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.

We are a large buyer of resin, copper, gold, brass, steel, chemicals and additives, and zinc. Many of these raw materials are produced
in a limited number of regions around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, the price of many of these raw materials, including gold, has increased in recent
years and continues to fluctuate. Over the last three years, we have only been able to partially offset these increases through higher selling prices. Our results of operations, financial position,
and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are continued significant
price increases for these raw materials. Any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and, to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through
productivity improvements or price increases to our customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Approximately 50% of
our net sales for fiscal 2009 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, and we expect revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net
revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the Euro, our U.S. Dollar reported revenue and income will
decrease. Changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We manage this risk in part by entering into
financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful.

The life cycles of our products can be very short.

The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to the development cycles. As a result, the resources devoted to
product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue, and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering
expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows would be materially and adversely affected.

A decline in the market value of our pension plans' investment portfolios could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with the current credit crisis, have caused significant volatility in
interest rates and equity prices, which could decrease the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios. A decrease in the value of our pension plans' investment portfolios could have an adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We may use components and products manufactured by third parties.

We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to
manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality
control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. We also have third-party arrangements for the manufacture of certain products, parts, and components. If



these
third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our
commercial reputation could be damaged.

Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.

Our success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees at our operations around the world. We depend on highly
skilled technical personnel to design, manufacture, and support our wide range of electronic components. Additionally, we rely upon experienced managerial, marketing, and support personnel to manage
our business effectively and to successfully promote our wide range of products. Any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the necessary global management, technical, human resource, and financial
skills to achieve our objectives may have adverse affects on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws, our business may suffer.

Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in
particular the United States and the European Union. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial, including distribution, agreements and
practices with respect to the electrical components or other markets is found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We also may be subject to third party
claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and
enforceable. If we are unable to enforce any of our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely
affected.

Future acquisitions may not be successful.

We regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our market
position or enhance our existing product offerings. We cannot assure you, however, that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Nor
can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results
of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity.

If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through additional
financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed
charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. We cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to
undertake an acquisition by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares.



Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.

While we have substantially completed the streamlining of our portfolio that we began over two years ago, we may in the future evaluate
the performance of specific businesses and may continue to sell businesses or product lines. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and
other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the
separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, and the potential loss of key
employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered.

We are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability.

Our workforce, manufacturing, administrative, and sales facilities, markets, customers, and suppliers are located throughout the world,
and we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:

•

tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes;

•

regulations related to customs and import/export matters;

•

variations in lengths of payment cycles;

•

tax issues, such as tax law changes, examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country,
and difficulties in repatriating in a tax-efficient manner cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions;

•

challenges in collecting accounts receivable;

•

employment regulations and local labor conditions;

•

difficulties protecting intellectual property;

•

instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, and actual or anticipated military or
political conflicts; and

•

the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

We
have sizeable operations in China, including manufacturing operations, and in fiscal 2009, 14% of our net sales were made to customers in China. The legal system in China is still
developing and is subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and orders for products in China could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of Chinese law.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and
their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these
anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with
anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always
will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such



violations,
could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, and violations.

We are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and non-U.S. environmental protection and health and safety laws
governing, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;

•

investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

We
may not have been, or we may not at all times be, in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or
otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Environmental laws outside of the United States are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or
materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal, and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws are
retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or
exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerly owned
sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for
the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites.

While
we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future
environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect
our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present,
or future business activities.

Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, and recycling.

The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing
environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other
related matters. These laws include the EU Restriction on Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the EU REACH (chemical registration)
Directive, the China law on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution by Electronic Information Products, and various other laws. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the
manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. We
cannot predict the extent to which these laws will proliferate in other jurisdictions or



expand
to address other materials or other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our
ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.

Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.

The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry,
companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual
property rights infringement or that we will not pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the size and importance of the patent or trademark in question, an unfavorable outcome
regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and
cash flows.

In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual
property rights, anti-competitive behavior, and product liability. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages.
The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or
settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt (as defined in the credit
facility) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the credit facility), and limits on subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding indentures
contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate, merge, and sell assets.

Although
we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control, and we
cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures. Upon the occurrence of
certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our lenders could
terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have
sufficient assets to repay our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of
our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder.

The
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to repurchase
the notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering
event.



Risks Relating to Our Separation from Tyco International

We are responsible for a portion of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities, including those relating to shareholder litigation.

In connection with our separation from Tyco International on June 29, 2007, we, Tyco International, and its former healthcare
businesses ("Covidien") entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement which governs the relationships among us, Tyco International, and Covidien subsequent to the separation and provided for
the allocation among us, Tyco International, and Covidien of Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to the separation. Under the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement among the parties, we, Tyco International, and Covidien have agreed to assume and be responsible for 31%,
27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate
liabilities are shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to consolidated securities
litigation, any actions with respect to the separation or the distribution brought by any third party and tax liabilities for periods prior to and including the date of separation of June 29,
2007. For more information on the contingent tax liabilities, see "We share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and
including the distribution date." Contingent and other corporate liabilities do not include liabilities that are specifically related to one of the three separated companies, which were allocated 100%
to the relevant company.

If
any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to
pay equally with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our
agreed-upon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities, including associated costs and expenses.

Prior
to the announcement by Tyco International of the planned separation of Tyco Electronics and Covidien in January 2006, Tyco International and certain of its former directors and
officers were named as defendants in over 40 purported securities class action lawsuits, most of which were part of a class action settlement of 32 lawsuits reached in 2007 and others of which have
been settled subsequently, for which we were responsible for 31%. We are responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the resolution of the remaining pending litigation. Of the
remaining securities cases, three remain outstanding, for which we have established a reserve. If the unresolved securities proceedings were to be determined adversely to Tyco International, our share
of any additional potential losses under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which are not presently estimable, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows.

Tyco
International has the right to control the defense and settlement of outstanding securities litigation, subject to certain limitations. The timing, nature, and amount of any
settlements of outstanding litigation may not be in our best interests. Furthermore, in the event of any future settlements, we may have limited notice before we would be required to pay our portion
of the settlement amount. Moreover, Tyco International stipulated, pursuant to a court order, that we, Tyco International, and Covidien each will be primarily liable for a portion of the obligations
arising from the Tyco International shareholder litigation. The stipulation also provides that if any party defaults on its obligations, the other parties are jointly and severally liable for the
defaulting party's obligations.



We share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's and Covidien's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date.

Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we share responsibility for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax
liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of U.S.
income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments
made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation. All costs and
expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax
Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

All
the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses, including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from Tyco International, became our tax liabilities. Although we
agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco
International and Covidien default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such
liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Tyco
International's, and Covidien's tax liabilities.

Our,
Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax
adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740 (Income Taxes) have been
reflected as a liability on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based
on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss
carryforwards. These estimates may change due to
changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax
liabilities and related interest.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International has the right to administer, control, and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.
The timing, nature, and amount of any settlement agreed to by Tyco International may not be in our best interests. Moreover, the other parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement will be able to remove Tyco
International as the controlling party only under limited circumstances, including a change of control or bankruptcy of Tyco International, or by a majority vote of the parties on or after the second
anniversary of the



distribution.
All other tax audits will be administered, controlled, and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax.

If the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could
incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

Tyco International received private letter rulings from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution
of our common shares and Covidien common shares to the Tyco International shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution, except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of our
common shares and the Covidien common shares, will qualify as tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). The private letter rulings also
provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the private letter rulings, Tyco
International obtained opinions from the law firm of McDermott Will & Emery LLP confirming the tax-free status of the distribution and certain internal transactions. The
private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from us, Tyco International, and Covidien regarding the past and future
conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions
should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distributions
should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, Tyco
International would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares and Covidien common shares distributed to Tyco International shareholders on the
distribution date over Tyco International's tax basis in such common shares, but such gain, if recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, we would incur
significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable
transactions.

In
addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result
of actions taken after the distribution by us, Tyco International, or Covidien, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us, Tyco International, or Covidien
as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us, Tyco International, or Covidien, then we, Tyco International, or Covidien would be
responsible for 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on us, Tyco International, or Covidien as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. In the event that
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be
responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party's obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party's taxes.

Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation

Legislative and other proposals in Switzerland, the United States, and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate.

Various U.S. and non-U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at companies incorporated in
lower-tax jurisdictions. We believe that recently there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and other initiatives. If adopted, these proposed changes could materially
increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate. We believe that, since becoming a Swiss corporation in June 2009, we are less likely to be subject to such legislation and other initiatives



because
Switzerland has both a generally imposed corporate income tax and comprehensive tax treaties with the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. However, we cannot predict the
outcome of any specific legislation or initiative and we cannot assure you that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us.

Legislation in the United States could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our
business by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions.

We
expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that
move their corporate locations abroad. We believe that we are less likely to be subject to such proposals since becoming a Swiss corporation in June 2009. However, we cannot predict the likelihood
that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and
increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot assure you that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In
addition, we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of
our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot
assure you that the impact will not be materially adverse to us.

As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management.

As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay distributions or dividends on our shares without shareholder
approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. Our articles of association authorize us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors, but this
authorization is limited to (i) authorized share capital up to 50% of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years and (ii) conditional share
capital of up to 50% of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing
shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional
share capital. Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate
actions, including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares for an
amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a
preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility
with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management will have an adverse effect on us, we cannot assure you that situations
will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.



Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against
us in Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize
or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or
those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of United States jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in
Swiss courts as they are contrary to that nation's public policy.

Swiss
corporate law, which applies to us, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the
manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification
available to directors and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a
jurisdiction of the United States.

Risks Relating to Our Shares

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.

The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including:

•

our quarterly or annual earnings;

•

changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide;

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by the global economic downturn and deterioration of credit
conditions;

•

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;

•

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and

•

the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies.

We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

In order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax, we anticipate making any future
distributions to shareholders, prior to January 1, 2011, through a reduction of registered share capital or, after January 1, 2011, out of registered share capital or contributed surplus
(as determined for Swiss tax purposes). Distributions to our shareholders in the form of a reduction of registered share capital are not subject to Swiss withholding tax. To date since we became a
Swiss corporation, all distributions on our shares recommended by our board of directors for approval by our shareholders and approved by our shareholders have been distributions through reductions in
our registered share capital. If we were to make future distributions to our shareholders through a dividend out of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax purposes) rather than through a
reduction of registered share capital prior to January 1, 2011, any dividends that we would



pay
generally would be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A
U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may
apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or for a full refund if the shareholder is a qualified pension fund). A Swiss tax resident holder may apply any tax withheld
for a full credit against Swiss income tax upon proper declaration of the related income in such Swiss resident holder's personal Swiss income tax return. There can be no assurance that our
shareholders will approve distributions through reductions in our registered share capital in the future, that we will be able to
meet the other legal requirements for a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of
registered share capital available for reductions will be limited.

Currency fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Swiss Franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders
to Swiss withholding tax.

Under Swiss corporate law, we are required to state our year-end unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements in
Swiss Francs. Although distributions that are effected through a return of registered share capital or contributed surplus are expected to be paid in U.S. Dollars, shareholder resolutions with respect
to such distributions are required to be stated in Swiss Francs. If the U.S. Dollar were to increase in value relative to the Swiss Franc, the U.S. Dollar amount of registered share capital available
for future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease.

We have certain restrictions on our ability to repurchase our shares.

The Swiss Code of Obligations limits a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only
repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our
registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, only if the
shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares
are dedicated for cancellation.

Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings.

Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that
issue registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as
shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders' meetings, but all
shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register
shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association.



Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders
might consider favorable.

Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered "anti-takeover" provisions because they would make
it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others:

•

shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and

•

restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15% or more of
our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors,

both
of which provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal
or delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or
otherwise be considered favorably by our shareholders. Our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital
(in either case, representing a maximum of 50% of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in the case of issuances from authorized capital, until June 22, 2011 unless
re-authorized by shareholders for a subsequent two-year period) without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders' preemptive rights or advance subscription
rights, for the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial
advisor, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for
withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange,
on which our shares are listed, requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20% or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Not applicable.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Properties

Our principal offices in the United States are located in Berwyn, Pennsylvania in a facility that we rent. We operate nearly
120 manufacturing, warehousing, and office locations in approximately 25 states in the United States. We also operate over 250 manufacturing, warehousing, and office locations in
over 50 countries and territories outside the United States.

We
own approximately 20 million square feet of space and lease approximately 10 million square feet of space. Our facilities are reasonably maintained and suitable for the
operations conducted in them.



Manufacturing

We manufacture our products in approximately 25 countries worldwide. These manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of the
manufacturing processes, including our primary processes of stamping, plating, molding, extrusion, beaming, and assembly. We expect to continue to migrate our manufacturing activities to
lower-cost countries as our customers' requirements shift. In addition, we will continue to look for efficiencies to reduce our manufacturing costs and believe that we can achieve cost
reductions through improved manufacturing efficiency and through the migration of manufacturing to lower-cost countries.

We
estimate that our manufacturing production by region in fiscal 2009 was approximately: Americas—30%, Europe/Middle East/Africa—40%, and
Asia-Pacific—30%.

We
expect that manufacturing production will continue to increase in the Asia-Pacific region as a percentage of total manufacturing as this region continues to experience
strong growth and our customers' manufacturing continues to migrate to the region.



ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Tyco Electronics Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including antitrust claims, product
liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal
claims. At any given time in the ordinary course of business, we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party's patent
were to be determined against us, we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one
or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a
corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.

Management
believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these
proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial positions, or cash flows in a future period.

Legal Matters under Separation and Distribution Agreement

The Separation and Distribution Agreement among us, Tyco International, and Covidien provided for the allocation among the parties of
Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to our and Covidien's separations from Tyco International on June 29, 2007. Under the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, we assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters at separation related to our business or assumed or retained liabilities, and will
indemnify the other parties for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Tyco Electronics remains responsible for 31% of certain potential liabilities that may arise
from litigation pending or threatened at separation that was not allocated to one of the three parties, and Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for 27% and 42%, respectively, of such
liabilities. If any party defaults in payment of its allocated share of any such liability, each non-defaulting party will be responsible for an equal portion of the amount in default
together with any other non-defaulting party, although any such payments will not release the obligation of the defaulting party. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, Tyco International manages and controls all the legal matters related to the shared contingent liabilities, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain
limitations. All costs and expenses that Tyco International incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation, other than the amount of any judgment or settlement, which will be allocated in
the manner described above, will be borne equally by Tyco International, Covidien, and us.

Tyco International Legal Proceedings

Securities Class Actions and Settlement

As previously reported in our periodic filings, prior to the separation, Tyco International and certain of its former directors and
officers were named as defendants in over 40 purported securities class action lawsuits. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to the
securities class actions were allocated among Tyco International, Covidien, and us. We are responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the resolution of the remaining pending
litigation. Most of the securities class actions were transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial
proceedings.



A
consolidated securities class action complaint was filed in these proceedings and on June 12, 2006, the court entered an order certifying a class "consisting of all persons and entities who
purchased or otherwise acquired Tyco securities between December 13, 1999 and June 7, 2002, and who were damaged thereby, excluding defendants, all of the officers, directors and
partners thereof, members of their immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, and any entity in which any of the foregoing have or had a controlling interest."
As previously reported, Tyco International settled 32 of the purported securities class action lawsuits arising from the actions alleged to have been taken by its prior management, for which we were
responsible for 31%. All legal contingencies that could have affected the final order entered in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire approving the settlement expired on
February 21, 2008. As of the opt-out deadline for the settlement, Tyco International received opt-out notices from individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of
the shares owned by class members. A number of these individuals and entities filed actions separately against Tyco International and/or Tyco International, Covidien, and us, all of which have been
settled subsequently. In addition, several cases asserting claims arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") were filed, all of which have been settled. See Note 15 to
the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding settlements of securities cases and reserves. Only three of the securities cases remain outstanding.

Outstanding Securities Actions

As previously reported, on October 30, 2003,

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

was transferred to the United States
District Court for the District of New Hampshire by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. The complaint asserts claims against
Tyco International based on Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. This action is
in the pre-trial stage.

As
previously reported, an action filed on September 2, 2004 captioned

Jasin v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

is
pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. The

pro se

plaintiff named as additional defendants Tyco International
(U.S.) Inc. and certain of Tyco International's former executives. Plaintiff's complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as Section 11 of the Securities Act. Claims against the former executives also are asserted under Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and Section 20A of the Exchange Act, as well as Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act. Plaintiff also
asserts common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unfair trade practice, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of Section 1-402
of the Pennsylvania Securities Act of 1972. This action is in the pre-trial stage.

As
previously reported, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred

Hall v. Kozlowski, et al.

, an action relating to
plaintiff's employment, 401(k) and pension plans, and ownership of Tyco International stock, to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. This action is in the
pre-trial stage.

Investigations

As previously reported, Tyco International and others received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC's Division of Enforcement,
the U.S. Department of Labor, the General Services Administration, and others seeking the production of documents in connection with various investigations into Tyco International's governance,
management, operations, accounting, and related controls prior to the separation. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco International and the administrators of certain of its benefit plans.
Tyco International has advised us that it cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can it predict what the results of these investigations



may
be. It is possible that Tyco International will be required to pay material fines or suffer other penalties, and pursuant to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution
Agreement, a portion of such payments may be allocated to us. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of
these matters. As a result, our share of such potential losses also is not estimable and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported, Tyco International received and has responded to various allegations that certain improper payments were made
by Tyco International subsidiaries, including Tyco Electronics subsidiaries, in recent years prior to the separation. Tyco International reported to the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC the
investigative steps and remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations, including that it retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its
policies, controls, and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and that it would continue to investigate and make periodic progress reports to these agencies. To
date, our baseline review has revealed that some of our former business practices may not comply with FCPA requirements. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters and other
allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of
these matters. However, it is possible that we may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties, or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows. Any judgment, settlement, or other cost incurred by Tyco International in connection with these matters not specifically allocated to Tyco International, Covidien,
or us would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

Litigation Matters Related to Our Former Wireless Systems Business

State of New York Contract

On September 19, 2005, our former Wireless Systems business was awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State
of New York (the "State") to construct, operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. On August 29, 2008, we were served by
the State with a default notice related to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by
the State. On October 16, 2008, we informed the State that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and
certified the system ready for testing. The State conducted further testing during November and December 2008. On January 15, 2009, the State notified us that, in the State's opinion, we had
not fully remediated the issues cited by the State and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that
it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State in conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, on January 16, 2009, the
State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of
credit, although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so.

On
February 13, 2009, we filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State terminated
the contract "for convenience." On September 25, 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claims. On
November 16, 2009, the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim. The counterclaim asserts a claim for breach of contract



and
alleges that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. We believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter. The
parties are now proceeding with discovery.

Com-Net

At September 25, 2009, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001
acquisition of Com-Net, representing the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system
for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not
believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania,
which is in the motion pleading and discovery phase.

ITEM 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to security holders for a vote during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 25, 2009.

based on a U.S. Dollar/Swiss Franc exchange rate shortly before declared.

Future dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders, if any, must be approved by our
shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved, our board of directors will



consider
our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem
relevant. We may from time to time enter into financing agreements that contain financial covenants and restrictions, some of which may limit our ability to pay dividends or to distribute capital
reductions.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our
plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include
those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Change of Domicile

Effective June 25, 2009, Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics" or the "Company"), which may be referred to as "we,"
"us," or "our") discontinued its existence as a Bermuda company as provided in the Bermuda Companies Act, and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private
Law, continued its existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations. The rights of holders of our shares are now governed by Swiss law, our Swiss
articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

The Separation

Effective June 29, 2007, we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd.
("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its
common shareholders (the "Separation").

Overview

The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and its
subsidiaries as an independent, publicly-traded entity subsequent to the Separation and a combined reporting entity comprising the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the electronics
businesses of Tyco International, including Tyco Electronics Ltd., for the period prior to the Separation.



Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in United States Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP"). The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for the period prior to the Separation may not be indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily
reflect what our consolidated and combined results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly-traded company prior to June 29,
2007. Certain general corporate overhead, net class action settlement costs, net interest expense, and other expenses for the period prior to the Separation were allocated to us by Tyco International.
Management believes such allocations were reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of our actual results had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the period prior to
the Separation. See Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding allocations.

We
are a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions, specialty products, and undersea telecommunication systems. We design, manufacture, and market
approximately 450,000 different products for customers in a broad array of industries including automotive; data communication systems and consumer electronics; telecommunications; aerospace, defense,
and marine; medical; energy; and lighting. We believe the end markets that we sell into are balanced with the total end market demand for our products.

We
operate through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Undersea Telecommunications. In May 2009, we sold our Wireless Systems
business which has been reclassified as discontinued operations. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and
discontinued operations, this business was reported as our former Wireless Systems segment. Also, effective January 1, 2009, we established the Specialty Products Group from our existing
businesses. The results of this new organization are reported as a separate reporting segment. This new segment is comprised of the Aerospace, Defense, and Marine; Touch Systems; Medical; and Circuit
Protection businesses which were formerly reported in the Electronic Components segment. Prior period segment information has been revised to conform to the current segment reporting structure in all
periods presented. See Notes 1 and 24 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments.

We
service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries. The sales force is supported by approximately 7,000 engineers, as well as
globally deployed manufacturing sites. Through our sales force and engineering resources, we are able to collaborate with our customers throughout the world to provide highly engineered products and
solutions to meet their needs.

Our
strategic objective is to increase our revenue and profitability across all of our segments in the markets we serve. This strategy is dependent upon the following strategic
priorities:

•

leverage our market leadership position to increase our market share;

•

achieve market leadership in attractive and under-penetrated industries;

•

extend our leadership in key emerging markets;

•

supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions;

•

improve operating margins; and

•

accelerate new product development through research and development excellence.



Key
business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
include:

•

Raw material price
increases.

We purchased approximately 125 million pounds of copper and 125,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2009. During the
periods shown, gold prices, as well as the prices of certain other raw materials, have been volatile and current year prices have increased from prior year levels. Copper prices remain high relative
to historic levels but have declined over the past year. The following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper and gold during the periods presented:

In
fiscal 2010, we expect to purchase approximately 125 million pounds of copper and 150,000 troy ounces of gold.

•

Foreign
exchange.

Approximately 50% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our results of operations are
influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we
translate those currencies into U.S. Dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:

U.S. Dollar

Euro


Japanese Yen


Chinese Renminbi

Economic Conditions

Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. Our sales are dependent
on certain end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets. As a
result of economic trends, we
experienced a 28.6% decrease in net sales in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. We expect net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to be $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion, a flat to
4% increase from fourth quarter fiscal 2009 levels, as a result of continued improvements in consumer end markets, partially offset by a decline in net sales in our Undersea Telecommunications
segment.

We
are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and on the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in order to
respond to changing conditions. We are also managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. (See
further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources.")



We
test goodwill allocated to reporting units for impairment annually during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances exist that indicate that a
reporting unit's carrying value may exceed its fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no impairment existed.

As
a result of declines in sales and profitability of the Automotive and Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting units of the Electronic Components segment and the Circuit
Protection reporting unit of the Specialty Products segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred and goodwill impairment testing of
these reporting units was required. Significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including,
among others, operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in
applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill.

The
testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process. In performing step I of impairment testing, we determined the fair value of the Automotive, Communications and Industrial
Solutions, and Circuit Protection reporting units based on a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating our estimate of future operating performance. The results of the step I goodwill impairment
tests indicated that the book value of each of the reporting units exceeded its fair value. The failure of the step I goodwill impairment tests triggered step II goodwill impairment tests in which we
determined the implied fair value of the reporting units' goodwill by comparing the reporting units' fair value determined in step I to the fair value of the reporting units' net assets, including
unrecognized intangible assets. The step II goodwill impairment tests resulted in a full impairment charge of $2,088 million for the Automotive reporting unit and partial impairment charges of
$1,347 million and $112 million for the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Circuit Protection reporting units, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

Discontinued Operations

During fiscal 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Wireless Systems business. In May 2009, we completed the sale
for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on this transaction. The divestiture of the Wireless Systems business substantially
completes the streamlining of our portfolio that we began two years ago.

In
September 2008, we completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million
pre-tax gain on the sale. In September 2008, we also completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a
$31 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In fiscal 2009, we recorded an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of working capital
adjustments relating to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. Also during fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds related to
working capital of $29 million in connection with the fiscal 2008 sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. The Consolidated Balance Sheet
reflected the $29 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets at September 26, 2008.

The
divestiture of our Power Systems business was authorized during fiscal 2007. As a result, we assessed Power Systems' assets for impairment and determined that the book value of the
Power Systems business exceeded its estimated fair value. We recorded a $585 million pre-tax impairment charge in fiscal 2007 in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of
income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. In fiscal 2008, we completed the sale of the Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a
$51 million pre-tax gain on the sale.



In
fiscal 2007, we completed the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain on the
sale.

The
Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Automotive Radar Sensors, Power Systems, and Printed Circuit Group businesses have been included in discontinued
operations in all periods presented on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to held for sale
and discontinued operations, the Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses were components of the former Wireless Systems segment. Both the
Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group businesses were components of the Other segment, which was subsequently renamed the Undersea Telecommunications segment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated
and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Other Divestitures

During fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Battery Systems business, which was part of the Electronic Components segment, for net
cash proceeds of $14 million after working capital adjustments. The divestiture resulted in a $7 million pre-tax loss on sale which is reflected in restructuring and other
charges, net on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. We have presented the loss on sale and the operations of the Battery Systems business in continuing operations due to
immateriality. See Note 4 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the Battery Systems business.

Subsequent
to fiscal year end 2009, we signed an agreement with a third party to sell the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line within our energy business for $16 million
in cash, subject to final working capital adjustments. We expect the sale to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. A pre-tax impairment charge of $12 million was
recorded in fiscal 2009 to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to fair value. The charge is reflected in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated and Combined
Statement of Operations. The product line, which was part of our Network Solutions segment, generated sales of $53 million in fiscal 2009. See Note 4 to the Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge.

Manufacturing Simplification and Cost Actions due to Current Economic Environment

We plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, by migrating facilities from higher-cost to
lower-cost countries, consolidating within countries, and transferring product lines to lower-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our
competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for profitability growth in the years ahead.

We
have closed a number of manufacturing facilities since we began our simplification program in 2007. As of fiscal year end 2009, we had fewer than 100 manufacturing sites as compared
to over 130 at the end of fiscal 2006.

As
a result of the current economic environment, we have accelerated workforce reductions through the elimination of temporary workers, attrition, and reductions in force. In fiscal
2009, we reduced our headcount by 17%, or approximately 16,000 positions.

In
connection with our manufacturing simplification plan and in response to the current economic environment, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately
$350 million from fiscal 2010 through 2011. In fiscal 2009, cash spending related to restructuring was approximately $260 million, and we anticipate spending approximately
$300 million in fiscal 2010. Cost savings related to these actions were $200 million in fiscal 2009. Thereafter, annualized savings are expected to be $300 million, consisting of
$200 million of manufacturing cost reductions and $100 million of savings in selling, general, and administrative expenses.



Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic net sales growth, which is included in the discussion below, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference
between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates,
acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under management's control,
such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.

We
believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it
provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying
results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations
of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and
analysis of organic net sales growth in Results of Operations below utilizes organic net sales growth as management does
internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other
companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this
measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables
presented in Results of Operations below provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP.

Net Sales.

Net sales decreased $4,117 million, or 28.6%, to $10,256 million in fiscal 2009 from $14,373 million
in fiscal 2008.
In fiscal 2008, net sales increased $1,799 million, or 14.3%, to $14,373 million from $12,574 million in fiscal 2007. On an organic basis, net sales decreased
$3,542 million, or 24.6%, in fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of declines in our Electronic Components, Specialty Products, and Network Solutions segments. Organic net sales increased
$944 million, or 7.5%, in fiscal 2008 as a result of strong growth in our Undersea Telecommunications segment and sales in international markets. Foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the
Euro, negatively impacted net sales by $482 million, or 3.4%, in fiscal 2009 and favorably impacted net sales by $823 million, or 6.5%, in fiscal 2008. Price erosion adversely affected
net sales by $187 million in fiscal 2009, $187 million in fiscal 2008, and $197 million in fiscal 2007. See further discussion below under Results of Operations by Segment.

Gross Income.

Gross income decreased $1,637 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and gross income as a
percentage of net sales
decreased by 430 basis points in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was due to sales declines and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production
levels related to lower sales and our efforts to reduce inventory levels, partially offset by cost reductions from restructuring actions.



In
fiscal 2008, gross income increased $454 million over fiscal 2007; however, gross income as a percentage of net sales decreased by 60 basis points. We were negatively impacted
by lower volume growth in certain consumer related end markets in our Electronic Components segment and significant growth in our Undersea Telecommunications segment which has a margin below our
Company average.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales
increased to 13.7% in
fiscal 2009 as compared to 10.9% in fiscal 2008. In fiscal
2009, results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation
of certain eastern European currencies. In fiscal 2008, selling, general, and administrative expenses included a $36 million gain on the sale of real estate related to our Electronic Components
segment. Excluding these items, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008, but increased as a percentage of sales due to decreases in sales volume.

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.9% and 12.0% in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. As discussed above, in fiscal 2008, selling,
general, and administrative expenses included a $36 million gain on the sale of real estate. Excluding this gain, selling, general, and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of
sales in fiscal 2008 due to sales volume leverage of our overhead structure. In 2007, selling, general, and administrative expenses included allocated overhead expenses from Tyco International of
$152 million. Also, we incurred costs of $41 million in fiscal 2007 related to building separate company functions. A portion of these costs were duplicative in fiscal 2007 as we were
also allocated costs related to these functions from Tyco International until the Separation date.

Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses.

Research, development, and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales
increased to 5.2% in
fiscal 2009 from 4.1% in fiscal 2008 and 4.2% in fiscal 2007. The increase as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 was due to decreases in sales volume as well as our continued focus on future
technologies within all four of our operating segments.

Pre-Separation Litigation Charges, Net.

In fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $144 million related to pre-Separation
securities litigation. During the first six months of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien entered into definitive agreements to settle actions captioned

Hess v.
Tyco International Ltd., et al.

and

Sciallo v. Tyco International Ltd., et al

. and opt-out cases
brought by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board, Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC and related plaintiffs, and the Public Employees' Retirement Association
of Colorado. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we recorded charges of $28 million for which no tax benefit was available. Additionally, in the second
quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded reserves totaling $375 million representing the best estimate of probable loss for the remaining securities litigation claims subject to the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, including remaining opt-out cases and cases arising under ERISA. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge in the first six months of fiscal 2009 of
$116 million for our share of the reserves. Upon final settlement of the ERISA cases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $25 million tax benefit. There were no tax
benefits attributable for the other cases.

During
the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien, settled the remaining opt-out cases for $201 million and eight consolidated
class actions brought under ERISA against Tyco International and certain of our current and former employees, officers and directors for a total of $70 million. Pursuant to the sharing formula,
our share of the settlement
amounts was $85 million. As we had previously established reserves for these opt-out cases and consolidated actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the settlements did not
impact our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations.



In
fiscal 2008, we recorded a net charge of $22 million related to pre-Separation securities litigation. A charge of $11 million, for which no tax benefit was
available, was recorded in connection with Tyco International's settlement of previously disclosed securities litigation captioned

Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al.

for $36 million. Also, in connection with Tyco International's settlement of securities litigation with the State of New Jersey for $73 million, we recorded a
charge of $23 million, for which no tax benefit was available. These charges represent our share of the settlement costs in accordance with the sharing percentages included in the Separation
and Distribution Agreement. Also, we recorded income of $12 million in fiscal 2008 related to Tyco International's recovery of certain costs from insurers.

In
fiscal 2007, we were allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million for the class action settlement, for which no tax benefit was available. In addition, in fiscal
2007, we were allocated $35 million of income relating to Tyco International's expected recovery of certain costs from insurers.

See
"Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the class action
settlement and the settlement of pre-Separation securities litigation.

Separation Costs.

In connection with the Separation, we incurred costs of $44 million in fiscal 2007, primarily related to
employee costs,
including non-cash compensation expense of $11 million related to the modification of share option awards at Separation and $12 million related to the acceleration of
restricted share award vesting as a result of Separation. See Note 23 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information on the conversion of Tyco International share
option awards into Tyco Electronics share option awards.

Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.

Net restructuring and other charges were $375 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to
$219 million
in fiscal 2008. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of sales, increased $145 million to $373 million in fiscal 2009 from $228 million in fiscal 2008. Increases
resulted primarily from new actions initiated in fiscal 2009 to reduce costs in response to market conditions and
primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures in the Electronic Components, Network Solutions, and Specialty Products segments. Fiscal 2009 charges included a
long-lived asset impairment in our Network Solutions segment of $14 million primarily related to the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line within our
energy business. As discussed above, subsequent to fiscal year end 2009, we signed an agreement with a third party to sell this product line. Fiscal 2008 charges included long-lived asset
impairments in our Electronic Components segment of $34 million, consisting of $22 million related to the divestiture of our Battery Systems business and $12 million related to
certain dedicated manufacturing lines serving the North American automotive market.

In
fiscal 2008, net restructuring and other charges were $219 million as compared to $92 million in fiscal 2007. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of
sales, were $228 million and $97 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. As discussed above, fiscal 2008 charges included long-lived asset impairments of
$34 million. Additional increases in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 resulted from our strategic priority to simplify our manufacturing footprint. During fiscal 2008 and 2007, we initiated
restructuring actions primarily relating to the migration of product lines to lower-cost countries and the exit of certain manufacturing operations in the Electronic Components and Network
Solutions segments. Restructuring charges recorded in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 primarily related to employee severance and benefits.

See
Note 4 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Impairment of Goodwill.

During fiscal 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3,435 million in our Electronic
Components segment,
of which $2,088 million and $1,347 million



related
to the Automotive and Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting units, respectively. We also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $112 million in our Specialty Products
segment related to the Circuit Protection reporting unit.

During
fiscal 2008, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $103 million which related to the Global Application Tooling Division reporting unit of our Electronic Components
segment.

See
Note 8 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of goodwill.

Operating Income (Loss).

Operating loss was $3,474 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to operating income of
$1,663 million in fiscal
2008. Fiscal 2009 results included goodwill impairment charges, restructuring and other charges, and pre-Separation litigation charges of $3,547 million, $373 million, and
$144 million, respectively. In addition, fiscal 2009 results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future
transaction and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. In fiscal 2008, operating income included restructuring and other charges of $228 million,
goodwill impairment charges of $103 million, a gain on the sale of real estate of $36 million, and pre-Separation litigation charges of $22 million. Excluding these
items, the decreases in operating income resulted from lower sales levels and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels and the focus on reducing
inventories, which were partially offset by cost reduction programs.

Operating
income was $1,663 million, or 11.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2008 as compared to $655 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2007. As discussed above, fiscal
2008 results included restructuring and other charges of $228 million, goodwill impairment charges of $103 million, a gain on the sale of real estate of $36 million, and
pre-Separation litigation charges of $22 million. Fiscal 2007 results included $887 million of allocated pre-Separation litigation charges, $97 million of
restructuring related and other charges, $44 million of separation costs, and $41 million of costs related to building separate company functions. Excluding these items, higher sales
levels in fiscal 2008 drove the increases in operating income. The increase as a percentage of net sales resulted from increased operating margin in our Undersea Telecommunications segment, primarily
due to sales volume leverage of our overhead structure.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008

In fiscal 2009 Electronic Components' net sales decreased $3,316 million, or 35.7%, to $5,961 million from
$9,277 million in fiscal 2008. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $287 million, or 3.1%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Organic net
sales decreased by $2,936 million, or 31.7%, in fiscal 2009 primarily due to declines in volume in all of the end markets we serve.

Electronic
Components organic net sales decreased 33.1% in the automotive market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was broad-based and resulted from declines of
36.8% in North America region, 36.9% in the EMEA region, and 25.6% in the Asia-Pacific region that were driven by reductions in production by automotive manufacturers as well as inventory
reductions throughout the automotive supply chain. Our organic net sales decline of 35.9% in the computer



market
in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was attributable to general market weakness, inventory corrections in the supply chain, and reductions in market share related to our strategy to
improve margins by exiting certain low-margin portions of this market. In the communications market, our organic net sales decline of 26.4% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was
driven by declines of 25.9% and 27.4% in our sales of interconnect components to communication equipment manufacturers and mobile phone manufacturers, respectively. In the appliance market, our
organic net sales decreased 29.1% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to reduced consumer demand, weak housing starts, and retailer inventory reductions. In fiscal 2009, our organic net
sales decreased 35.2% in the industrial market as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of reduced demand for factory automation and other industrial equipment due to declines in capital
investments by our customers.

Electronic
Components had an operating loss of $3,716 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to income of $978 million in fiscal 2008. As discussed above, segment results
included goodwill impairment charges of $3,435 million and $103 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Also, segment results included a $36 million gain on the sale
of real estate in fiscal 2008. Excluding these items, the remaining
decrease in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 resulted from the sales decline and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels and inventory reductions,
partially offset by cost savings from restructuring actions. In addition, fiscal 2009 segment results were negatively impacted by an increase in restructuring and other charges of $80 million
and a net foreign currency loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of
certain eastern European currencies.

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007

In fiscal 2008, Electronic Components' net sales increased $746 million, or 8.7%, to $9,277 million from
$8,531 million in fiscal 2007. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $593 million, or 6.9%, in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Organic
net sales growth of $121 million, or 1.4%, in fiscal 2008 resulted from increases in volume partially offset by price erosion.

Electronic
Components' organic net sales growth by industry end market was strongest in the industrial and communications markets in fiscal 2008. Our organic net sales growth of 18.5% in
the industrial market in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was due to global demand for products in the solar market and investment in industrial equipment for emerging markets. In the communications
market, our organic net sales growth of 12.0% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to 30.3% growth in our sales of interconnect components to mobile phone manufacturers
resulting from our strategic efforts to increase our market share as well as end market unit growth. In the automotive market, our organic net sales growth of 2.7% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007
resulted from growth in the Asia-Pacific region of 12.4% and the EMEA region of 3.7% partially offset by a 16.1% decline in the North America region that was driven by continued reductions
in production by automotive manufacturers. In the computer market, our organic net sales decline of 6.0% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 resulted from a strategic decision to exit certain
low-margin products, which negatively impacted net sales by approximately $57 million, and to be more selective in the new projects in which we participate.

Electronic
Components' operating income decreased $85 million, or 8.0%, to $978 million in fiscal 2008 from $1,063 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, segment
results included goodwill impairment charges of $103 million and a gain on the sale of real estate of $36 million. In addition, Electronic Components incurred $28 million of costs
in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International. Excluding these items, higher sales were partially offset by higher raw material costs as well as an increase in restructuring
costs of $146 million in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008

Network Solutions' net sales decreased $443 million, or 20.5%, to $1,719 million in fiscal 2009 from
$2,162 million in fiscal 2008. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $173 million, or 8.0%, in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008. Organic net sales
decreased $270 million, or 12.5%, in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008.

Our
organic net sales decreased 9.0% in the energy industry end market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to declines in Europe. Sales in Europe were negatively
impacted by slower investment levels by utilities and reduced customer inventory levels. In the service providers market, our organic net sales decrease of 12.3% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal
2008 was largely



due
to a general slowing of capital spending by telecommunications companies. Our organic sales in the enterprise networks market decreased 19.1% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result
of global declines in commercial construction and delayed investment in network upgrades.

Network
Solutions' operating income decreased $118 million, or 47.0%, to $133 million in fiscal 2009 from $251 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease was the result of
decreased sales, unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels and our targeted inventory reductions, and an increase in restructuring and other charges of
$34 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007

Network Solutions' net sales increased $265 million, or 14.0%, to $2,162 million in fiscal 2008 from
$1,897 million in fiscal 2007. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $148 million, or 7.9%, in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Organic net sales
growth was $117 million, or 6.1%, in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007.

On
an organic basis, Network Solutions' net sales growth was strongest in the enterprise networks industry end market in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 with growth of 10.6% attributable to
strong global demand for faster, higher capacity, and more secure networks. In the energy market, our organic net sales growth of 6.0% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was attributable to
solid growth in EMEA, Asia, and North America. In western Europe and North America, growth resulted from the upgrade of aging power grids and the demand for alternate energy sources. In emerging
markets within Asia and eastern Europe, growth was due to the build-out of energy infrastructure. In the service providers market, our organic net sales growth of 3.5% in fiscal 2008 over
fiscal 2007 reflects increased spending levels at certain U.S. telecommunications carriers that more than offset declines in EMEA.

Network
Solutions' operating income increased $22 million, or 9.6%, to $251 million in fiscal 2008 from $229 million in fiscal 2007. The operating income increase
resulted from increases in volume and a decrease in restructuring costs of $14 million partially offset by a lower margin product mix and lower productivity levels in fiscal 2008 as compared to
fiscal 2007. In addition, Network Solutions incurred $5 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008

In fiscal 2009, Specialty Products' net sales decreased $354 million, or 20.0%, to $1,415 million from
$1,769 million in fiscal 2008. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $22 million, or 1.2%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Organic net
sales decreased $332 million, or 18.8%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.

Our
organic net sales declined 14.0% in the aerospace, defense, and marine market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of slowing demand for commercial aircraft and
inventory corrections in the supply chain. In the touch systems market, our organic net sales decreased 23.7% in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due to global weakness in demand from the retail market.
In the medical market, our organic net sales decrease of 8.6% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due to inventory corrections in the supply chain and delayed capital spending by most
healthcare providers. On an organic basis, our net sales decline of 32.1% in the circuit protection market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due to reduced original equipment manufacturer
production levels as well as significant inventory corrections in the supply chain.

Specialty
Products' operating results decreased $262 million to $34 million in fiscal 2009 from $296 million in fiscal 2008. As discussed above, segment results
included a goodwill impairment charge of $112 million in fiscal 2009. The remaining decrease in operating results was due to lower sales, unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs
associated with reduced production levels and our targeted inventory reductions, and an increase in restructuring and other charges of $28 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007

In fiscal 2008, Specialty Products' net sales increased $188 million, or 11.9%, to $1,769 million from
$1,581 million in fiscal 2007. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $81 million, or 5.2%, in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Organic net sales
growth of $107 million, or 6.7%, in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 primarily related to sales of products to the aerospace, defense, and marine and touch systems markets.

In
the aerospace, defense, and marine market, our organic net sales growth of 9.9% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to strong demand in the commercial
aviation



market
and spending for certain defense programs. Our organic net sales in the touch systems market increased 8.5% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 largely due to the growing use of touch
screen interfaces in numerous markets, particularly in the retail, gaming, medical, and industrial markets. In the circuit protection market, our organic net sales growth slowed to 2.3% in fiscal 2008
as compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of slowing growth in demand in the lithium-ion battery market for much of fiscal 2008 and the supply chain inventory correction in this market in
late fiscal 2008. In the medical market, our organic net sales increase of 1.0% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflected higher demand in surgical and imaging applications that was largely
offset by the exit of certain low margin business in patient monitoring applications.

Specialty
Products' operating results increased $38 million to $296 million in fiscal 2008 from $258 million in fiscal 2007. The operating income increase resulted
from increases in volume and a higher margin product mix in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by an increase in research, development, and engineering of
$16 million. In addition, Specialty Products incurred $8 million of costs in fiscal 2008 related to a customs settlement. In fiscal 2007, Specialty Products also incurred
$7 million of costs that related to our Separation from Tyco International.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008

In fiscal 2009, Undersea Telecommunications' net sales decreased $4 million, or 0.3%, to $1,161 million from
$1,165 million in fiscal 2008. Undersea Telecommunications' organic net sales decreased 0.4% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as revenue from existing and new projects offset the
reduction caused by the completion, in fiscal 2008, of a transoceanic system that connects U.S. and China.

In
fiscal 2009, Undersea Telecommunications' operating income increased $59 million to $219 million from $160 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease in income from the
transoceanic system and an increase in restructuring and other charges of $3 million were more than offset by income from existing and new projects and favorable project mix in fiscal 2009 as
compared to fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007

In fiscal 2008, Undersea Telecommunications' net sales increased $600 million, or 106.2%, to $1,165 million from
$565 million in fiscal 2007. This growth was attributable to our execution of the construction of a transoceanic system that connects the U.S. and China, as well as several other projects,
including large projects in Asia, Africa, North America, and Europe.

In
fiscal 2008, Undersea Telecommunications' operating income increased $124 million to $160 million from $36 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of increased volumes
and improved operating leverage. Segment results included $1 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International.



Non-Operating Items

Interest Expense, Net

Net interest expense was $148 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to $158 million in fiscal 2008 and $179 million
in fiscal 2007. The decrease of $10 million, or 6.3%, in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 as well as the decrease of $21 million, or 11.7%, in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was driven by
lower average debt levels resulting in lower interest expense partially offset by lower interest income.

A
portion of Tyco International's net interest expense was allocated to us through June 1, 2007. During fiscal 2007, we were allocated net interest expense of $130 million,
which included the impact of Tyco International's interest rate swaps. Management believes the net interest expense allocation basis was reasonable; however, these amounts may not be indicative of the
actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the period prior to Separation.

Other Income (Expense), Net

In fiscal 2009, we recorded net other expense of $48 million, consisting of $68 million of expense pursuant to the Tax
Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien, a $22 million gain on the retirement of debt, and $2 million of unrealized losses on rabbi trust assets. The $68 million of
expense is attributable to a net reduction of an indemnification asset primarily as a result of the settlement of various matters with the IRS. See Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 11 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the gain
on retirement of debt.

In
fiscal 2008, we recorded other income of $567 million, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien, of which $545 million related to
certain incremental tax liabilities recorded in connection with the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740 (Income Taxes). See
Note 18 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740.

Net
other expense of $219 million in fiscal 2007 includes an allocation from Tyco International of $232 million for loss on retirement of debt. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, in fiscal 2007, we recorded other income of $13 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco
International and Covidien.

Income Taxes

Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We have provided for
income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations
is subject to taxation. In fiscal 2009, we changed our place of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. We do not expect the change to materially impact our tax provision or cash tax burden.

Our
effective tax rate was 15.7% for fiscal 2009 and includes the effects of the $3,547 million pre-tax impairment of goodwill for which a partial tax benefit of
$523 million was recorded, a $28 million charge related to the settlement of a tax matter, a $144 million pre-tax charge related to pre-Separation
securities litigation for which a partial tax benefit of $25 million was recorded, and a $24 million detriment related to a $68 million pre-tax expense recognized
pursuant to our Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. Additionally, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects adjustments related to prior years tax returns, including a
$49 million tax benefit.

Our
effective income tax rate was 26.1% for fiscal 2008 and includes a benefit of $198 million primarily related to the pre-tax income of $545 million
recognized in connection with our adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, for which no tax was provided. The effective tax rate



was
also impacted by increased accruals in fiscal 2008 of interest related to uncertain tax positions partially offset by a $42 million benefit associated with a favorable settlement with a
taxing authority for certain pre-Separation tax issues. In addition, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects the benefits of increased profitability in operations in lower tax rate
jurisdictions, a $33 million benefit related to adjustments to tax account balances, a $25 million increase in the valuation allowance related to restructuring charges, and a
$22 million tax detriment recorded in connection with the goodwill impairment charge for which a tax benefit was not fully realized.

Our
effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 includes the effects of the pre-tax charges recorded in connection with the allocated class action settlement and loss on retirement of
debt for which no tax benefits were recorded. These impacts on the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 were $312 million and $81 million, respectively. In addition, the fiscal 2007
effective tax rate reflects tax detriments related to increased borrowings in order to fund the class action settlement escrow and our Separation from Tyco International.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $2,487 million and $873 million at fiscal year end 2009 and 2008, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of
the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income
to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740
which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our
operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss
carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities.
These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our
current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded
amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and
interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. Substantially all of these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as payment is not expected within one year.

We
have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in
fiscal 2010. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for
temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or
we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 25, 2009, certain subsidiaries had approximately
$14 billion of undistributed earnings that we intend to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if our intentions to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are
distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis
differences related to investments in subsidiaries.



Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes

Loss from discontinued operations was $156 million in fiscal 2009 compared to income from discontinued operations of
$255 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2007, loss from discontinued operations was $340 million.

During
fiscal 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Wireless Systems business. In May 2009, we completed the sale for $664 million in net cash proceeds and
recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on this transaction.

Pre-tax
loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 included pre-tax charges of $111 million related to the Wireless Systems business's contract with
the State of New York. See Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the State of New York contract. The income tax provision on
discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 included $68 million relating to the impact of $319 million of goodwill written off in connection with the divestiture of the Wireless Systems
business, for which a tax benefit was not fully realized, as well as $35 million of adjustments to the estimated tax provision on the Power Systems business as a result of the finalization of
the tax basis of assets sold upon the filing of the fiscal 2008 income tax returns.

In
September 2008, we completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million
pre-tax gain on the sale. In September 2008, we also completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a
$31 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In fiscal 2009, we recorded an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of working
capital adjustments relating to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. The total pre-tax gain on the sale of the Radio Frequency
Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses was $187 million and $32 million, respectively. Also during fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds related to
working capital of $29 million in connection with the fiscal 2008 sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses.

During
fiscal 2008, we completed the sale of our Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $51 million pre-tax gain on the
sale.

During
fiscal 2007, the divestiture of our Power Systems business was authorized, and in connection with the approval, we recorded a $585 million pre-tax impairment
charge. Also, in fiscal 2007, we completed the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain on the
sale.

See
Note 5 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Our
ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or
other sources of financing, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of
potential funding are sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. Also, we may use excess capital to reduce our outstanding debt levels, including the possible
repurchase of our public debt in accordance with applicable law, and purchase a portion of our outstanding common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program. Current economic
conditions have negatively impacted cash generated from operations; however, we continue to believe that actions taken by management to reduce costs and working capital, along with other sources of
liquidity, will enable us to meet our future capital needs. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future financing will not be impacted by continued financial market
instability. We will continue to monitor financial markets, to respond as necessary to changing conditions.

Net
cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,378 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to $922 million in fiscal 2008 and $1,447 million in fiscal 2007.

The
finalization of the class action settlement in February 2008 negatively impacted cash flows from operating activities during 2008. It resulted in a decrease to cash flows from
operating activities and an increase to cash flows from investing activities of $936 million. It did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because we had fully funded
our portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability during fiscal 2007. Related net class action settlement costs of $887 million were
recognized in fiscal 2007.



Excluding
the class action settlement, net cash provided by continuing operating activities was lower in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower income levels
partially offset by working capital improvements. Inventory levels decreased in the current year, with days on hand decreasing from 78 at fiscal year end 2008 to 68 at fiscal year end 2009.

The
amount of pension and postretirement benefit contributions reflected in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, were $145 million, $77 million, and $71 million,
respectively. These amounts included voluntary
pension contributions of $61 million in fiscal 2009. We expect pension contributions to be $85 million in fiscal 2010, before consideration of voluntary contributions.

The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, was $121 million, $359 million, $446 million, respectively. The decrease in
fiscal 2009 reflects lower taxable earnings levels. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2007 included a $163 million advance payment to the IRS for
pre-Separation tax liabilities.

We
continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further enhance productivity and manufacturing
capabilities. Capital spending decreased $282 million in fiscal 2009 to $328 million as compared to $610 million in fiscal 2008. We expect fiscal 2010 capital spending levels to
be approximately $425 million. During fiscal 2007, we exercised our option to buy five cable-laying sea vessels that were previously leased to us and used by the Undersea Telecommunications
segment at a cost of $280 million, which was reflected as a capital expenditure.

In
fiscal 2009, we received net cash proceeds of $664 million related to the sale of our Wireless Systems business. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds
related to working capital of $29 million in connection with the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystems and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which occurred in fiscal 2008 and
$17 million primarily related to the divestiture of the Battery Systems business.

In
fiscal 2008, we received net cash proceeds of $102 million, $427 million, and $42 million related to the sale of the Power Systems, Radio Frequency Components and
Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses, respectively.

In
fiscal 2007, we received $227 million in net cash proceeds related to the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business.



As discussed above, during fiscal 2007, we funded our portion of the class action settlement escrow for $928 million. The finalization of the class action
settlement in fiscal 2008 resulted in an increase to cash flows from investing activities of $936 million, but did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Total
debt at fiscal year end 2009 and 2008 was $2,417 million and $3,181 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements
for additional information regarding debt.

During
June 2009, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, commenced a tender offer to purchase up to $150 million principal amount of its 6.00%
senior notes due 2012, up to $100 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and up to $100 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037. On
July 7, 2009, the tender offer expired and on July 9, 2009, TEGSA purchased and cancelled $86 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $42 million
principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $23 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037 for an aggregate payment of $141 million, plus paid accrued
interest through July 7, 2009 of $3 million to the sellers of the notes. As a result of the transaction, in fiscal 2009, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million,
which is included in other income, including the write-off of unamortized discounts and fees of $1 million and the recognition of a gain of $12 million associated with
terminated interest rate swaps previously designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, as a result of the re-purchase and cancellation, unamortized losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income of $3 million related to terminated starting forward interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were recognized as interest expense.

In
April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). In fiscal 2009, $75 million of the commitment was
assigned by Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB to TEGSA, reducing the total effective commitment to $1,425 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at TEGSA's option, at a base rate
or the London interbank offered rate
plus a margin dependent on TEGSA's credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points depending on its credit
ratings. As of fiscal year end 2009 and 2008, TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility.



As
of fiscal year end 2008, TEGSA had $647 million of commercial paper outstanding at an average interest rate of 4.01%. We have repaid and suspended our borrowings under the
commercial paper program as a result of unfavorable market conditions in fiscal 2009.

Our
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in
the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.5 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered under the
Credit Facility. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of
September 25, 2009, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, Credit Facility, commercial paper, and profit sharing notes issued by a subsidiary are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco
Electronics Ltd.

Payments
of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $294 million and $271 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. In October 2009, our
shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.17 per share for each of the first and second
quarters of fiscal 2010. This capital reduction will reduce the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24) to CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92). The distribution
will be paid in U.S. Dollars at a rate of $0.16 per share for each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. Future distributions or dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by
our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such distributions or dividends be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash
requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant.

During
fiscal 2009, we purchased approximately 6 million of our common shares for $125 million under our share repurchase program. Also, during fiscal 2009, we settled
purchases of $27 million of our common shares which occurred prior to the end of fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, we repurchased approximately 37 million common shares for
$1,269 million under this program, of which $1,242 million
was paid as of September 26, 2008. No common shares were repurchased under this program in fiscal 2007. Since inception of the share repurchase program, which has a current authorization of
$2,000 million, we have purchased approximately 43 million shares for $1,394 million.

The
table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make
contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type,
including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $85 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2010,
before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 14 to the Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements.

Other
long-term liabilities of $634 million, of which $339 million related to our ASC 460 (Guarantees) liability, are excluded

460.

Income Tax Matters

In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidien's, Tyco Electronics', and
Tyco International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a
result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning
of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain
contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities
settled in cash by Tyco Electronics with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and
Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a
portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation.



Prior
to Separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax
authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling
party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest
that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to Tyco
Electronics entities, have been recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco International's tax obligations.
Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. See Note 12 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for
additional information.

In
prior years, in connection with the IRS audit of various fiscal years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax
returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. The IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the IRS had completed its
field work. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we have determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2005 is probable and, accordingly, have
recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Tyco
International continues to complete proposed adjustments to the remainder of its U.S. federal income tax returns. In fiscal 2009, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income
tax returns were completed by Tyco International and in connection with these adjustments, we recorded a $97 million increase in income tax liabilities, a $10 million increase in
deferred tax assets, a $60 million increase in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, and a $27 million charge to contributed
surplus. In fiscal 2008, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and presented to the IRS. As a result, in fiscal 2008, we recorded a
$225 million decrease in income tax liabilities, a $42 million decrease in deferred tax assets, a $140 million decrease in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in
connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, a $57 million increase in the indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien, and a $14 million charge to contributed surplus.
See Note 12 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien.

In
fiscal 2008, Tyco International, Covidien, and we completed and filed certain fiscal 2007 U.S. consolidated federal and state income tax returns which included a combination of Tyco
International, Covidien, and our subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded a $66 million decrease in income tax liabilities with a corresponding offset to the income tax receivable, a
$44 million decrease in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien and a $42 million decrease in the payable to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing
Agreement, a $30 million increase in contributed surplus, and a $32 million net adjustment to other related tax accounts.

As
our tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to Separation, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on
our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Additionally, adjustments may be recorded to shareholders' equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income tax
returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and/or our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the Separation.



During
fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued anticipated
Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. Tyco International has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling
$498 million, with an estimated cash impact of $458 million which was paid by Tyco International during fiscal 2007. Our portion of this payment was $163 million. It is our
understanding that Tyco International has appealed other proposed adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and is vigorously defending its prior filed tax return positions. Additionally,
the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. Any
penalty imposed would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. It is our understanding that Tyco International is vigorously opposing the assertion
of any such penalties.

It
is our understanding that Tyco International has made progress during fiscal 2009 towards resolving several of the disputed tax issues for the years 1997 through 2000 and it could
reach agreement with the IRS on these matters within the next twelve months. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Tyco International settled a matter with the IRS concerning certain tax
deductions claimed on Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a $28 million income tax charge in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions. The IRS continues to audit certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004.

We
continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate
resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Legal Matters

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims,
antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. Management believes that these legal proceedings and
claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable
law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, one or
more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a future period. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings"
and Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

As
previously reported, prior to the Separation Tyco International and certain of its former directors and officers were named as defendants in over 40 purported securities class action
lawsuits, including ERISA-related litigation. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to the securities actions were allocated among Tyco
International, Covidien, and us. We are responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the resolution of the remaining pending litigation. If Tyco International or Covidien were to
default on their obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, we would be required to pay additional amounts. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, Tyco International manages and controls all the legal matters related to the shared contingent liabilities, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain
limitations. The liability sharing provisions regarding these securities actions are set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement among Tyco International, Covidien, and us.



Class Action Settlement

As previously reported, Tyco International settled 32 of the purported securities class action lawsuits arising from the actions
alleged to have been taken by its prior management. All legal contingencies that could have affected the final order approving the settlement expired on February 21, 2008. The settlement did
not resolve all securities cases. Additional settlements of remaining securities actions have been reached subsequently as discussed below. As of the opt-out deadline for the settlement,
Tyco International received opt-out notices from individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. A number of these individuals and entities filed
actions separately against Tyco International and/or Tyco International, Covidien, and us, all of which have been settled subsequently as discussed below. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal
Proceedings" and Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information about these proceedings.

In
fiscal 2007, we were allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million for the class action settlement, for which no tax benefit was available. In addition, in fiscal
2007, we were allocated $35 million of income relating to Tyco International's expected recovery of certain costs from insurers. The net charge of $887 million was recorded on the
Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as pre-Separation litigation charges, net. The portion allocated to us was consistent with the sharing percentage included in the
Separation and Distribution Agreement. Tyco
International placed funds in escrow for the benefit of the class. The escrow account earned interest that was payable to the class. In addition, interest was accrued on the class action settlement
liability.

The
finalization of the class action settlement in February 2008 resulted in the extinguishment of our class action settlement liability of $3,020 million, interest in the escrow
of $936 million, and class action settlement receivable of $2,084 million from the Consolidated Balance Sheet in fiscal 2008. The finalization of the settlement resulted in a decrease to
cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2008. It did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because we had
previously fully funded our portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability, as mentioned above.

Settlement of Securities Proceedings Not Covered by the Class Action Settlement

In fiscal 2008, Tyco International settled securities litigation captioned

New Jersey v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al.

and

Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

for $73 million and
$36 million, respectively. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we recorded charges of $34 million, for which no tax benefit was available, in
fiscal 2008. In addition, we recorded income of $12 million in fiscal 2008 related to Tyco International's recovery of certain costs from insurers.

During
the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien entered into definitive agreements to settle actions captioned

Hess v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al.

and

Sciallo v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

and an opt-out case brought
by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we recorded charges of
$9 million, for which no tax benefit was available.

During
the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien settled opt-out cases with Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC and related plaintiffs and the
Public Employees' Retirement Association of Colorado. Pursuant to the sharing formula, we recorded charges of $19 million, for which no tax benefit was available. Additionally, we recorded
reserves totaling $375 million representing the best estimate of probable loss for the remaining securities litigation claims subject to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, including
remaining opt-out cases and cases arising under ERISA. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 of $116 million



for
our share of the reserves. Upon final settlement of the ERISA cases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $25 million tax benefit. There were no tax benefits attributable for
the other cases.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien settled five of the remaining opt-out cases for $199 million. Pursuant to the sharing
formula, our share of the settlement amounts was $62 million. As we had previously established reserves for these opt-out cases during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the
settlements did not impact our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien settled for a total of $70 million eight consolidated class actions brought under ERISA against Tyco
International and certain of its current and former employees, officers and directors. Pursuant to the sharing formula, our share of the settlement amount was $22 million. Also, during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien agreed to settle the remaining opt-out case for $2 million. Pursuant to the sharing formula, our share of the
settlement amount was $1 million. As we had previously established reserves for these consolidated actions and this opt-out case during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the
settlements did not impact our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. Only three of the securities cases remain outstanding.

Matters Related to Our Former Wireless Systems Business

Certain liabilities and contingencies related to our former Wireless Systems business were retained by us when this business was sold
in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. These include certain retained liabilities related to the State of New York contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the acquisition of
Com-Net by the Wireless Systems business in 2001. See additional information below. Also, see Note 5 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information
regarding the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business.

State of New York Contract

On September 19, 2005, we were awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State of New York to construct,
operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. On August 29, 2008, we were served by the State with a default notice related
to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the State. On October 16, 2008, we
informed the State that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing. The State
conducted further testing during November and December 2008. On January 15, 2009, the State notified us that, in the State's opinion, we had not fully remediated the issues cited by the State
and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs
incurred by the State in conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, on January 16, 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an
irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit, although we dispute that the State has
any basis to do so.

On
February 13, 2009, we filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State terminated
the contract "for convenience." On September 25, 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claims. On
November 16, 2009, the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim. The counterclaim asserts a claim for breach of contract



and
alleges that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. We believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter. The
parties are now proceeding with discovery.

As
a result of these actions, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $111 million associated with this contract. These charges are
reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as a result of our sale of the Wireless Systems business. See Note 5 to the
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations and the sale of the Wireless Systems business. The charges included an impairment charge of
$61 million to write-off all costs incurred in constructing the network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the State against the standby letter of credit of
$50 million. The assets related to the impairment charge were previously reflected primarily as inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have not recognized any revenue related to the
lease contract.

Com-Net

At September 25, 2009, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001
acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system
for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not
believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania,
which is in the motion pleading and discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment
is probable or estimable at this time.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and
financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2010 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of
nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks
involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities
and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have
no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

As
of September 25, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $395 million, of which $50 million was related to our
contract with the State of New York. See Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the State of New York contract.

We
have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a
discussion of these liabilities.



In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, except for the charges related to the contract with the
State of New York discussed below, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

As
disclosed in Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, in January 2009, the State of New York drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby
letter of credit funded by us. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge equal to the draw. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby
letter of credit which could result in additional charges and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain
contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities
settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with
respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of
such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These
arrangements have been valued upon our separation from Tyco International in accordance with ASC 460 and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to $339 million were recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet at September 25, 2009. See Notes 12 and 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information.

We
generally record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. See Note 12 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding
estimated product warranty.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in
making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The following noted accounting policies are based on, among other things,
judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605 (Revenue Recognition) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 101
and 104.

Our
revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the
customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For
those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience
and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is established at the time of sale based on historical
experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales.



Contract sales for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on
contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to
total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the
period in which they first become determinable. Contract sales for construction related projects are generated primarily within our Undersea Telecommunications segment.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value, except for inventoried costs which are costs incurred in the performance
of long-term contracts primarily by our Undersea Telecommunications segment. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based upon product demand and historical experience.
Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a
determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are
amortized on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and
circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is
assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth quarter
of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating
results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment
in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in ASC 350-20 (Intangibles—Goodwill and Other: Goodwill). First, we perform a step I
goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its
fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied
fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a
reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a
reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Estimates
about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting
unit. The income approach has been supported by additional transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, and
income tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.



Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments
affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and
financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international
pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment
about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in
the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax
assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Prior to September 26,
2009, if a change in a valuation allowance occurred, which was established in connection with an acquisition, the adjustment of such allowance may have affected goodwill rather than the income tax
provision. Subsequent to the adoption of the business combination provisions of ASC 805 (Business Combinations) on September 26, 2009, any changes in a valuation allowance that was established
in connection with an acquisition, regardless of when the acquisition occurred, will be reflected in the income tax provision.

Changes
in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we
conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740 (Income Taxes), we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax
jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact
of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss
carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to
changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax
liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate
of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the
ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. Substantially all of these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as payment is
not expected within one year.



Pension and Postretirement Benefit

Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense
and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as
retirement, mortality, and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the
market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension
plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension
obligations by $110 million, while a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our present value of pension obligations by $105 million. We consider the current and
expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets. During fiscal 2008, our Investment Committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. Plans' Master Trust from 60%
equity and 40% fixed income to 30% equity and 70% fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations. The target asset allocation transition began
in fiscal 2008. As a result of economic conditions during 2009, we have slowed the transition of the Master Trust asset allocation change. Asset reallocation will continue over a
multi-year period based on the funded status of the U.S. Plans' Master Trust. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase our
pension expense by $9 million, while a 50 basis point increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would decrease our pension expense by $9 million.

Share-Based Compensation

Under ASC 718 (Compensation—Stock Compensation), we determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires certain assumptions that involve judgment. Such assumptions are the expected share price volatility, expected annual
dividend yield, expected life of options, and risk-free interest rate. (See Note 23 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information related to
share-based compensation.) An increase in the volatility of the Company's stock will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards. An increase in the holding period of options will also
cause an increase in compensation expense. Dividend yields and risk-free interest rates are less difficult to estimate, but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in
expense and an increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.

Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") to serve as the
single source of authoritative GAAP. We adopted the ASC in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Adoption did not have an impact on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

In
May 2009, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 855 (Subsequent Events). ASC 855 establishes general standards for accounting and disclosure of events occurring subsequent to the balance
sheet date but prior to issuance of the financial statements. We adopted ASC 855 in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 26 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for the
required disclosures related to subsequent events.



In
March 2008, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 815 (Derivatives and Hedging), amending and expanding the disclosure requirements related to the use of derivative instruments
and hedging activities to provide improved transparency into the uses and financial statement impact of derivative instruments and hedging activities. The new disclosure provisions of ASC 815 were
adopted by us in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 13 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for the required disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging
activities.

In
March 2007, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 715-60 (Compensation—Retirement Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans—Other Postretirement) related to the
accounting for collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We adopted the guidance in ASC 715-60 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Accordingly, we recognized accrued
and other current liabilities of $1 million and other liabilities of $4 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2009 with a
corresponding decrease in the opening balance of accumulated deficit of $5 million.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 820 (Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures) that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, expands
disclosure about fair value measurements, and introduces the fair value option for certain financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 was adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We did not
elect to value any existing assets or liabilities at fair value upon adoption, nor did we apply the fair value option to any eligible assets acquired or liabilities incurred during the quarter. We
will adopt the non-financial asset and liability fair value provisions in fiscal 2010. See Note 16 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information
related to fair value measurements.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 715 (Compensation—Retirement Benefits) that requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension
and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service
costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under ASC 715, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations
as of their fiscal year end. We adopted the presentation requirements of ASC 715 on September 28, 2007 and the measurement date provisions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result of
the change in measurement date, we recorded a charge of $7 million to accumulated deficit. See Note 14 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information
related to the change in measurement date provisions.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810 (Consolidation) that address accounting for variable interest entities.
These updates to ASC 810 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We are currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on our results of operations, financial position, or
cash flows.

In
April 2009 and December 2007, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 805 (Business Combinations). ASC 805 addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired,
liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business combinations. ASC 805 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our
results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
December 2008, the FASB issued updates to the guidance in ASC 715 (Compensation—Retirement Benefits) that enhance disclosures regarding assets in defined benefit pension
or other postretirement plans. The updates to ASC 715 are effective for us in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on our Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements.



In
December 2007, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810 (Consolidation) that address the accounting and reporting framework for minority interests by a parent company. These
updates to ASC 810 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated
with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management
policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks.

We
do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major
financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long-term debt rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty.

Foreign Currency Exposures

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we use foreign exchange forward and swap contracts. The
objective is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other cash
transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the September 25, 2009 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $2 million, while a 10%
depreciation of the U.S. Dollar would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $2 million. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the September 26, 2008 market rates
would have increased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $95 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar would have decreased the unrealized value of our forward contracts
by $116 million. Such gains or losses on these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions.

Interest Rate Exposures

We issue debt, from time to time, in capital and money markets to fund our operations. Such borrowings can result in interest rate
exposure. To manage the interest rate exposure and to minimize overall interest cost, we have used, and may in the future use, interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt
into variable rate debt (fair value hedges) and/or convert a portion of variable rate debt into fixed-rate debt (cash flow hedges). During fiscal 2009, we terminated interest rate swaps
designated as fair value hedges on $300 million principal amount of our 6.55% senior notes and $200 million principal amount of our 6.00% senior notes that had been outstanding as of
September 26, 2008. See Note 13 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information on the termination of the interest rate swaps. At September 25,
2009, we had no floating rate debt outstanding. Based on our floating rate debt balance of $1,147 million at



September 26,
2008, an increase in the levels of the U.S. Dollar interest rates by 0.5%, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of
approximately $6 million.

Commodity Exposures

Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of
fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we have used and may use in the future forward and option contracts. We continually evaluate the commodity market
with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to twenty-four months and periodically enter into commodity forward or option contracts in order to hedge a portion
of usage requirements over that period. At September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, our commodity hedges, which related to purchases of gold, were in a gain position of
$1 million and $2 million, respectively, and had a notional value of $29 million and $21 million, respectively. A 10% appreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold from
the September 25, 2009 prices would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $3 million, while a 10% depreciation of prices would decrease the unrealized value of our
forward contracts by $3 million. A 10% appreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold from the September 26, 2008 prices would have increased the unrealized value of our forward
contracts by $2 million, while a 10% depreciation of prices would have decreased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $2 million.

None.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 25, 2009. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 25, 2009.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 25, 2009.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of
September 25, 2009, which is included in this Annual Report.

Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

We
previously disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to accounting for income taxes in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2008 and our information statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K on
June 8, 2007. Subsequent to the filing of our combined financial statements for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 in the initial filing of our registration statement with the SEC, we determined that
our combined financial statements contained certain errors. The errors primarily resulted from the process of carving out certain income tax accounts from Tyco International's consolidated financial
statements and related information. We substantially relied upon the processes at Tyco International to prepare our carve-out accounts for income taxes. We determined that certain of those
tax processes utilized by Tyco International in determining certain carve out amounts for income taxes did not operate at a sufficient level of precision relative to our materiality for
us to ensure that the carve-out accounts were materially correct. We also determined that we did not have sufficient control processes in place to ensure that the information provided by
Tyco International was complete and accurate and concluded that the absence of these control processes was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to income
taxes.



We
enhanced our tax accounting resources and capabilities to remediate the material weakness indicated above, and implemented new control processes and procedures during fiscal 2007 and
2008. Improvements to our control processes included the following:

•

We implemented appropriately designed processes and controls and instituted multi-level management reviews.

•

We completed analysis and reconciliation of our tax accounts and recorded necessary adjustments while implementing
sustainable reconciliation processes to ensure continued accuracy of these accounts.

•

We enhanced policies and procedures relating to tax account reconciliation and analysis.

•

We expanded tax accounting resources at both the corporate and regional levels with personnel experienced in accounting
for income taxes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

•

We conducted training for both existing and newly hired tax accountants along with other accounting and finance personnel
who are responsible for analyzing, documenting and accounting for taxes in their jurisdiction.

•

We increased accountability for accounting for income taxes by recording tax accounting at the legal entity, developed and
communicated clear responsibilities and expectations, and implemented a multi-level review process.

•

We invested in additional information systems to improve control around newly implemented processes and enable more
effective review.

These
processes have been operating for a sufficient period of time, and we have determined that they are operating effectively. As a result of these improvements in our control
processes, we believe that the material weakness has been remediated.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Except for the remediation of the material weakness discussed above, during the quarter ended September 25, 2009, there were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tyco Electronics Ltd.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 25, 2009 and September 26,
2008 and the related consolidated and combined statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 25, 2009. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated and combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 25, 2009 and
September 26, 2008 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 25, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated and combined financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, prior to its separation from Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"), the Company was
comprised of the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the electronics businesses of Tyco International. The combined financial statements also included allocations of corporate
overhead, net class action settlement costs, net interest expense, and other expenses from Tyco International. These allocations may not be reflective of the actual level of costs which would have
been incurred had the Company operated as a separate entity apart from Tyco International.

As
discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in fiscal 2008, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")-issued
guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740 (Income Taxes) relating to the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes.

As
discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in connection with its separation from Tyco International, the Company entered into certain
guarantee commitments with Tyco International and Covidien plc and has recorded the fair value of these guarantees.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
September 25, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 18, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tyco Electronics Ltd.:

We
have audited Tyco Electronics Ltd. and subsidiaries' (the "Company's") internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2009, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on that risk, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2009, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated and combined financial statements and financial
statement schedule of the Company as of and for the year ended September 25, 2009, and our report dated November 18, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated and
combined financial statements and financial statement schedule.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics" or the "Company") is a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions, specialty products, and undersea
telecommunication systems.

Change of Domicile

Effective June 25, 2009, the Company discontinued its existence as a Bermuda company as provided in Section 132G of The
Companies Act of 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the "Bermuda Companies Act"), and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued its existence
as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations (the "Change of Domicile"). The rights of holders of the Company's shares are now governed by Swiss law, the
Company's Swiss articles of association, and the Company's Swiss organizational regulations.

The Separation

Effective June 29, 2007, the Company became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco
International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco
International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (the "Separation").

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and
its subsidiaries as an independent, publicly-traded company subsequent to the Separation and a combined reporting entity comprising the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the
electronics businesses of Tyco International, including Tyco Electronics Ltd., for the period prior to the Separation.

The
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in United States Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("GAAP"). The preparation of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges, acquisition liabilities, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash flows associated with asset impairments,
useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, estimated contract revenue and related costs, legal contingencies, tax reserves and deferred
tax asset valuation allowances, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and postretirement employee benefit expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these
estimates.

The
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for the period prior to the Separation may not be indicative of the Company's future performance and do not necessarily reflect what
its consolidated and combined results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had it operated as an independent, publicly-traded company prior to June 29, 2007. To the
extent that an asset, liability, revenue, or expense is directly associated with the Company, it is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Certain general
corporate overhead, net class action settlement costs, net interest expense, and other expenses for the period prior to the



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Separation
were allocated by Tyco International to the Company. Management believes such allocations were reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of the actual results of the Company had the
Company been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the period prior to the Separation. See Note 17 for further information regarding allocations.

Description of the Business

The Company consists of four reportable segments:

•

Electronic Components.

The Electronic Components segment
is one of the world's largest suppliers of passive electronic components, which includes connectors and interconnect systems, relays, switches, sensors, and wire and cable. The products sold by the
Electronic Components segment are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers and their contract manufacturers in the automotive, computer, communications, industrial, appliance, and consumer
electronics markets.

•

Network Solutions.

The Network Solutions segment is one of
the world's largest suppliers of infrastructure components and systems for telecommunications and energy markets. These components include connectors, above-and below-ground enclosures,
heat shrink tubing, cable accessories, surge arrestors, fiber optic cabling, copper cabling, and racks for copper and fiber networks. This segment also provides electronic systems for test access and
intelligent cross-connect applications as well as integrated cabling solutions for cabling and building management.

•

Specialty Products.

The Specialty Products segment is a
leader in providing highly-engineered custom solutions, components, and connectors for electronic systems, subsystems, and devices in the aerospace, defense, and marine; touch systems; medical; and
circuit protection markets.

•

Undersea Telecommunications.

The Undersea
Telecommunications segment designs, builds, maintains, and tests undersea fiber optic networks for both the telecommunications and oil and gas markets.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares or otherwise has the
ability to control through similar rights. In addition, the Company consolidates variable interest entities in which the Company bears a majority of the risk to the entities' expected losses or stands
to gain from a majority of the entities' expected returns. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included on the Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

Fiscal Year

Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements to fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, and fiscal
2007 are to Tyco Electronics' fiscal years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008, and September 28, 2007. Tyco Electronics' fiscal year is a "52-53 week"
year ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period is 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will
include 14 weeks, with the first such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2011.

Reclassifications

During fiscal 2009, the Company reclassified certain expenses on its Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. Research,
development, and engineering expenses, which were previously classified as cost of sales, are separately presented on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. Intangible asset
amortization expense, which was previously reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses, is now presented in cost of sales. Also, impairment of long-lived assets which was
previously presented in impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets is now reflected in restructuring and other charges, net.

Research,
development, and engineering expenses were $536 million, $593 million, and $532 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Intangible asset
amortization expense in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $31 million, $33 million, and $32 million, respectively. Impairment of long-lived assets was $14 million
and $34 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The reclassifications had no impact on previously reported operating income (loss), net income (loss), or earnings (loss) per share. All
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

The Company's revenues are generated principally from the sale of its products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the
time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed
and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, the Company has deferred the recognition of revenue.

The
Company provides certain distributors with an inventory allowance for returns or scrap equal to a percentage of qualified purchases. A reserve for estimated scrap and returns
allowances is established at the time of the sale based on a fixed percentage of sales to distributors authorized and agreed to by the Company and is recorded as a reduction of sales.

Other
allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a
reduction of sales. The Company believes it can reasonably and reliably estimate the amounts of future allowances.

Contract
sales for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are
based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs.
Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they
first become determinable. Contract sales for construction related projects are generated primarily within the Company's Undersea Telecommunications segment.

The
Company generally warrants that its products will conform to the Company's or mutually agreed to specifications and that its products will be free from material defects in materials
and workmanship for a limited time. The Company limits its warranty to the replacement or repair of



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

defective
parts or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. The Company accepts returned goods only when the customer makes a verified claim and the Company has authorized the return.
Returns result primarily from defective products or shipping discrepancies. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as
a reduction of sales.

Additionally,
certain of the Company's long-term contracts in its Undersea Telecommunications segment have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty costs for each contract
are determined based on the contract terms and technology-specific considerations. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the construction period of the
respective contracts under percentage-of-completion accounting.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in research, development, and engineering expenses.
Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred, and building and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $439 million,
$482 million, and $428 million, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the Company's outstanding
receivables determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, and other currently available evidence.

Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market value, except for inventoried
costs which are costs incurred in the performance of long-term contracts primarily by the Company's Undersea Telecommunications segment.

Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net and Long-Lived Assets

Net property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged
to expense when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

5 to 40 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of remaining term of the lease or economic useful life

Machinery and equipment

1 to 15 years



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The Company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and
amortizable intangible assets, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential
impairment are present, the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. An impairment
in the carrying value of an asset group is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value. The amount of impairment
recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows
and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a
determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging
from 1 to 50 years that are amortized on a straight-line basis. See Note 9 for additional information regarding intangible assets. An evaluation of the remaining useful life
of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. The Company assesses intangible assets with a determinable life
for impairment consistent with its policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by
comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever the Company believes a triggering event requiring a more frequent
assessment has occurred. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows,
transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

At
fiscal year end 2009, the Company had 9 reporting units, of which 7 contained goodwill. See Note 8 for information regarding goodwill impairment testing. When changes occur in
the composition of one or more operating segments or reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, the Company performs a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, the Company compares the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the
amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the
carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is
determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and
liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to
its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Estimates
about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting
unit. The income approach has been supported by additional transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, and
income tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 740 (Income Taxes). In these
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, the benefits of a consolidated return have been reflected where such returns have or could be filed based on the entities and jurisdictions included in
the financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected on the Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss carryforwards using tax
rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Financial Instruments

In order to address certain financial exposures, the Company has established policies regarding the use of derivative financial
instruments. The Company currently enters into foreign exchange forward and swap contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and forward contracts to reduce the effects of
commodity price fluctuations. Also, the Company has designated certain intercompany non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies as a hedge of its net investments
in certain foreign operations denominated in the same foreign currencies.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as either
cash flow or fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair
value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged, with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or
liability being recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reflected in other comprehensive income, a component of equity, to the
extent that they are deemed effective. Effectiveness of cash flow hedges is measured quarterly and any changes in fair value that are determined to be ineffective are recognized currently in earnings
in either cost of sales or selling, general, and administrative expenses. The remeasurement of the intercompany non-derivative financial instruments designated as a hedge of the Company's
net investment in foreign operations is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets offsetting the change in cumulative
translation adjustment attributable to the Company's net investments in certain foreign operations.

The
Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments by using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Standard
market conventions are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives.

Share-Based Compensation

Under Accounting Standards Codification 718 (Compensation—Stock Compensation), the Company determines the fair value of
share awards on the date of grant. Share options are valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model; restricted share awards are valued using the end-of-day share price
of Tyco Electronics on the date of grant. That fair value is expensed ratably over the expected service period, with an allowance made for estimated forfeitures based on historical employee activity.
See Note 23 for additional information related to the Company's share-based compensation.

Currency Translation

For the Company's non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars
using year-end exchange rates. Sales and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income within equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, which are included in net income (loss), were $71 million of losses during fiscal 2009 and immaterial amounts in
fiscal 2008 and 2007.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") to serve as the
single source of authoritative GAAP. The Company adopted the ASC in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Adoption did not have an impact on its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

In
May 2009, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 855 (Subsequent Events). ASC 855 establishes general standards for accounting and disclosure of events occurring subsequent to the balance
sheet date but prior to issuance of the financial statements. The Company adopted ASC 855 in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 26 for the required disclosures related to subsequent
events.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 815 (Derivatives and Hedging), amending and expanding the disclosure requirements related to the use of derivative instruments
and hedging activities to provide improved transparency into the uses and financial statement impact of derivative instruments and hedging activities. The new disclosure provisions of ASC 815 were
adopted by the Company in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 13 for the required disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities.

In
March 2007, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 715-60 (Compensation—Retirement Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans—Other Postretirement) related to the
accounting for collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangements. The Company adopted the guidance in ASC 715-60 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Accordingly, the Company
recognized accrued and other current liabilities of $1 million and other liabilities of $4 million on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2009
with a corresponding decrease in the opening balance of accumulated deficit of $5 million.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In
September 2006, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 820 (Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures) that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, expands
disclosure about fair value measurements, and introduces the fair value option for certain financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 was adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The
Company did not elect to value any existing assets or liabilities at fair value upon adoption, nor did it apply the fair value option to any eligible assets acquired or liabilities incurred during the
quarter. The Company will adopt the non-financial asset and liability fair value provisions in fiscal 2010. See Note 16 for additional information related to fair value
measurements.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 715 (Compensation—Retirement Benefits) that requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension
and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service
costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under ASC 715, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations
as of their fiscal year end. The Company adopted the presentation requirements of ASC 715 on September 28, 2007 and the measurement date provisions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a
result of the change in measurement date, the Company recorded a charge of $7 million to accumulated deficit. See Note 14 for additional information related to the change in measurement
date provisions.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810 (Consolidation) that address accounting for variable interest entities.
These updates to ASC 810 are effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on its results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows.

In
April 2009 and December 2007, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 805 (Business Combinations). ASC 805 addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired,
liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business combinations. ASC 805 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact
on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In
December 2008, the FASB issued updates to the guidance in ASC 715 (Compensation—Retirement Benefits) that enhance disclosures regarding assets in defined benefit pension
or other postretirement plans. The updates to ASC 715 are effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on its
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810 (Consolidation) that address the accounting and reporting framework for minority interests by a parent company. These
updates to ASC 810 are effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or
cash flows.

Loss on Divestiture

During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on divestiture of $7 million related to the sale of the
Battery Systems business. The Battery Systems business, which was part of the Electronic Components segment, was sold for net cash proceeds of $14 million after working capital adjustments. The
loss is reflected in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. The Company has presented the loss on sale and the operations of the Battery Systems
business in continuing operations due to immateriality.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $14 million primarily related to the
divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line. During fiscal 2009, the Company's board of directors authorized management to pursue the divestiture of the product line within the
Company's energy business in the Network Solutions segment. Based on an estimated sales price of $16 million, the Company determined that the carrying value of the product line's assets and
liabilities was in excess of its fair value. An impairment
charge of $12 million was recorded in fiscal 2009 to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to fair value. The charge is presented in restructuring and other charges, net
on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. The Dulmison connectors and fittings product line generated sales of $53 million in fiscal 2009.

During
fiscal 2008, the Company's board of directors authorized management to proceed with strategic alternatives with respect to the Company's Battery Systems business. Based on a
negotiated sales price of $30 million, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Battery Systems business' assets and liabilities exceeded its fair value. Consequently, a
pre-tax impairment charge of $22 million was recorded in fiscal 2008 to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to the fair value. The charge is presented in
restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations.

During
fiscal 2008, the Company determined that the certain North American automotive customer-specific product lines in the Electronic Components segment were impaired due to declining
future production expectations. The Company determined that an impairment test was necessary due to changes in the North American automotive industry. These asset groups were assessed for
recoverability and impaired based on estimates of the asset group fair values. Using a discounted cash flows analysis, the Company determined that a pre-tax impairment charge of
$12 million was required to write the carrying value down to the fair value. The charge is presented in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of
Operations.

5. Discontinued Operations

During fiscal 2009, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Wireless Systems
business. In May 2009, the Company completed the sale for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on this transaction.

In
September 2008, the Company completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million
pre-tax gain on the sale. In September 2008, the Company also completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a
$31 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of
working capital adjustments relating to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. The total pre-tax gain on the sale of the Radio Frequency
Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses was $187 million and $32 million, respectively. Also during fiscal 2009, the Company received additional cash proceeds
related to working capital of $29 million in connection with the fiscal 2008 sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. The Consolidated
Balance Sheet reflected the $29 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets at September 26, 2008.

The
divestiture of the Company's Power Systems business was authorized during fiscal 2007. As a result, the Company assessed Power Systems' assets for impairment and determined that the
book value of the Power Systems business exceeded its estimated fair value. The Company recorded a $585 million pre-tax impairment charge in fiscal 2007 in income (loss) from
discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. In fiscal 2008, the Company completed the sale of its Power Systems business for
$102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $51 million pre-tax gain on the sale.

In
fiscal 2007, the Company completed the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax

The
Company tests goodwill allocated to reporting units for impairment annually during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances exist that indicate
that a reporting unit's carrying value may exceed its fair value. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no impairment
existed.

As
a result of declines in sales and profitability of the Automotive and Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting units of the Electronic Components segment and the Circuit
Protection reporting unit of the Specialty Products segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred and goodwill impairment
testing of these reporting units was required. Significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of
factors including, among others, operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's
judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill.

The
testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process. In performing step I of impairment testing, the Company determined the fair value of the Automotive, Communications and
Industrial Solutions, and Circuit Protection reporting units based on a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating the Company's estimate of future operating performance. The results of the step I
goodwill impairment tests indicated that the book value of each of the reporting units exceeded its fair value. The failure of
the step I goodwill impairment tests triggered step II goodwill impairment tests in which the Company determined the implied fair value of the reporting units' goodwill by comparing the reporting
units' fair value determined in step I to the fair value of the reporting units' net assets, including unrecognized intangible assets. The step II goodwill impairment tests resulted in a full
impairment charge of $2,088 million for the Automotive reporting unit and partial impairment charges of $1,347 million and $112 million for the Communications and Industrial
Solutions and Circuit Protection reporting units, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

8. Goodwill (Continued)

During
the fiscal 2008 annual impairment test, the Company determined that the book value of the Global Application Tooling Division, a reporting unit in the Electronic Components
segment, exceeded its fair value. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating the Company's estimate of future operating performance. The goodwill impairment test
indicated that there was no implied value related to the goodwill, resulting in an impairment of the reporting unit's entire goodwill balance of $103 million.

All
goodwill impairment charges are presented in impairment of goodwill on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.

During June 2009, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, commenced a tender offer to purchase up
to $150 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, up to $100 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and up to $100 million principal
amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037. On July 7, 2009, the tender offer expired and on July 9, 2009, TEGSA purchased and cancelled $86 million principal amount of its 6.00%
senior notes due 2012, $42 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $23 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037 for an aggregate payment of
$141 million, plus paid accrued interest through July 7, 2009 of $3 million to the sellers of the notes. As a result of the transaction, in fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a
pre-tax gain of $22 million, which is included in other income, including the write-off of unamortized discounts and fees of $1 million and the recognition of a
gain of $12 million associated with terminated interest rate swaps previously designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, as a result of the re-purchase and cancellation,
unamortized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income of $3 million related to terminated starting forward interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were recognized as interest
expense.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

11. Debt (Continued)

In April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). In fiscal 2009, $75 million of the commitment was
assigned by Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB to TEGSA, reducing the total effective commitment to $1,425 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at TEGSA's option, at a base rate
or the London interbank offered rate plus a margin dependent on TEGSA's credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5
basis points depending on its credit ratings. As of fiscal year end 2009 and 2008, TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the
Credit Facility.

The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if the Company's ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.5 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered
under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility and the Company's other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.

TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, Credit Facility, commercial paper, and profit sharing notes issued by a subsidiary are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco
Electronics Ltd.

During
the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company terminated interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on $300 million principal amount of the 6.55% senior notes and
$200 million principal amount of the 6.00% senior notes. Prior to the termination, the interest rate swaps were marked to fair value, resulting in premiums of $49 million and
$14 million associated with the 6.55% senior notes and 6.00% senior notes, respectively. The premiums will be recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the life of the respective
notes. See Note 13 for additional information on interest rate swaps.

In
periods prior to Separation, Tyco International's consolidated debt, exclusive of amounts incurred directly by the Company, was proportionately allocated to the Company based on the
historical funding requirements of the Company using historical data. Net interest expense was allocated in the same proportions as debt through June 1, 2007 and includes the impact of interest
rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. For fiscal 2007, Tyco International allocated to Tyco Electronics interest expense of $150 million and interest income of
$20 million.

In
addition, Tyco International allocated to the Company loss on retirement of debt in the amount of $232 million for fiscal 2007, which is included in other income (expense), net
on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. The method utilized to allocate loss on retirement of debt was consistent with the allocation of debt and net interest expense as described
above.

Management
believes the allocation basis for debt, net interest expense, and loss on retirement of debt was reasonable based on the historical financing needs of the Company; however,
these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that the Company would have incurred in fiscal 2007 had it been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the period prior to
Separation.

The
fair value of the Company's debt was approximately $2,420 million and $3,115 million at fiscal year end 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Separation and Distribution Agreement

Upon Separation, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with Tyco International and
Covidien to effect the Separation and provide a framework for the Company's relationships with Tyco International and Covidien after the distribution of the Company's and Covidien's shares to Tyco
International's shareholders. These agreements govern the relationships among Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company subsequent to the Separation and provide for the allocation to the Company
and Covidien of certain of Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to the Separation.

Under
the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company, Covidien, and Tyco International
assumed 31%, 42%, and 27%, respectively, of certain of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and
other corporate liabilities are shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to consolidated securities litigation and any actions with respect
to the Separation or the Distribution brought by any third party. If any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, Tyco Electronics may
be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed-upon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities, including associated costs and
expenses.

Tax Sharing Agreement

Upon Separation, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which the Company shares responsibility for certain of its,
Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. The Company, Covidien, and Tyco International share 31%,
42%, and 27%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to its, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns. The effect of the
Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify the Company for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the Company with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. Pursuant to that

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

12. Guarantees (Continued)

indemnification,
the Company has made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved
pre-Separation tax matters. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. The Company is responsible for all
of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not
subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

All
of the tax liabilities of Tyco International that were associated with Tyco International subsidiaries that are included in Tyco Electronics following the Separation became Tyco
Electronics' tax liabilities upon Separation. Although Tyco Electronics has agreed to share certain tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco
Electronics remains primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco International and Covidien default on their obligations to Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco Electronics
would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law
for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed upon share of its, Tyco
International's, and Covidien's tax liabilities.

Indemnification

The Company's indemnification created under the Tax Sharing Agreement qualifies as a guarantee of a third party entity's debt under ASC
460 (Guarantees). ASC 460 addresses the measurement and disclosure of a guarantor's obligation to pay a debt incurred by a third party. To value the initial guarantee obligation, the Company
considered a range of probability-weighted future cash flows that represented the likelihood of payment of each class of liability by each of the three post-Separation companies. The
expected cash flows incorporated interest and penalties that the companies believed would be incurred on each class of liabilities and were discounted to the present value to reflect the value
associated with each at Separation. The calculation of the guarantee liability also included a premium that reflected the cost for an insurance carrier to stand in and assume the payment obligation at
the Separation date.

At
inception of the guarantee, based on the probability-weighted future cash flows related to unresolved tax matters, the Company, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, faced a maximum
potential liability of $3 billion, based on undiscounted estimates and interest and penalties used to determine the fair value of the guarantee and an assumption of 100% default on the parts of
Tyco International and Covidien, a likelihood that management believes to be remote. In the event that the Company is required, due to bankruptcy or other business interruption on the part of Tyco
International or Covidien, to pay more than the contractually determined 31%, the Company retains the right to seek payment from the effected entity.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

12. Guarantees (Continued)

At
September 28, 2007, the probability-weighted cash flows and risk premium of certain unresolved pre-Separation tax matters for which the Company has made
indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien resulted in a fair value of the liability of $296 million, which was reflected as an adjustment to contributed surplus on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2008, the Company, while assessing its income tax positions under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, decreased this liability by $14 million and
recorded the adjustment to other income on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. Also, in fiscal 2008, this liability was increased by $57 million as a result of the completion
by Tyco International of certain proposed tax adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns. (See Note 15 for additional information regarding the proposed tax adjustments.) As of
September 25, 2009, the total liability of $339 million was recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has assessed the probable future cash payments to
Tyco International and Covidien for pre-Separation income tax matters pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement and determined this amount remains sufficient to satisfy these
expected obligations.

Other Matters

In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks
including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and
manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such
indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions; however, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows.

At
September 25, 2009, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $395 million, of which $50 million was related to its
contract with the State of New York. See Note 15 for additional information regarding the State of New York contract.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, except for the charges related to the contract with
the State of New York discussed below, such obligations will not significantly affect the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

As
disclosed in Note 15, in January 2009, the State of New York (the "State") drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by the Company.
As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge equal to the draw. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit which
could result in additional charges and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

13. Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, and derivative financial instruments. The fair value of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximated book value as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008. See Note 11 for additional
information on the fair value of debt and Note 16 for additional information on fair value measurements.

The
Company uses derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, and commodity risks.

The
Company accounts for derivative financial instrument contracts on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. For instruments not designated as hedges under ASC 815 (Derivatives
and Hedging), the changes in the instruments' fair value are recognized as selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. For instruments
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or
periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of a cash flow hedge are recognized currently, based on the nature of the ineffectiveness, in cost of sales or
selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the
carrying value of the asset or liability hedged, with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability being recognized in earnings.

To
the extent that Tyco International entered into hedges on behalf of the Company prior to Separation, the statement of operations effects of those hedges have been allocated to the
Company as part of the Tyco International general corporate overhead expense allocation or interest expense allocation as appropriate. See Note 17 for additional information regarding allocated
expenses.

The
cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.

The
Company's derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks; however, concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated as the Company deals with a variety
of financial institutions worldwide with long-term Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch credit ratings



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Financial Instruments (Continued)

of
A/A2 or higher. In addition, only conventional derivative financial instruments are utilized. The Company is exposed to potential losses if a counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of
its agreement. With respect to counterparty net asset positions recognized at September 25, 2009, the Company has assessed the likelihood of counterparty default as remote. At this time, the
Company is not required, nor does it require, collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments.

Foreign Exchange Risks

As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company utilizes foreign exchange forward and swap
contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815-30 (Derivatives and Hedging: Cash Flow Hedges). The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts
to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other cash transactions.

At
September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, the Company had net liabilities of $1 million and $5 million, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
related to foreign exchange instruments. The Company expects that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the cash flow hedge-designated instruments
will be reclassified into the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations within the next twelve months as adjustments to cost of sales.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company issues debt, from time to time, in capital and money markets to fund its operations. Such borrowings can result in interest
rate exposure. To manage the
interest rate exposure and to minimize overall interest cost, the Company has used, and may use in the future, interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixed-rate debt into
variable-rate debt (fair value hedges) and/or convert a portion of variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt (cash flow hedges).

During
the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company terminated interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on $300 million principal amount of the 6.55% senior notes and
$200 million principal amount of the 6.00% senior notes. Prior to the termination, the interest rate swaps were marked to fair value, resulting in premiums of $49 million and
$14 million associated with the 6.55% senior notes and 6.00% senior notes, respectively. The premiums will be recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the life of the respective
notes. As a result of the termination of the interest rate swaps the Company recognized reductions in interest expense of $8 million during fiscal 2009. As a result of the Company's tender
offer, as discussed in Note 11, the Company recognized $12 million of the premiums as a component of the gain on retirement of debt included in other income (expense), net on the
Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations.

During
fiscal 2007, in anticipation of issuing fixed-rate debt, the Company entered into and, concurrent with the Company's fixed-rate debt issuance, terminated
forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest expense that would result from changes in interest rates between the date of the swap and the Company's anticipated date of
issuing fixed-rate debt. These forward starting interest rate swaps were designated as effective hedges of the probable interest payments under ASC 815-30. Upon the issuance of
the Company's senior notes in September 2007, these swaps were terminated for a cash payment of $54 million. The effective portion of these swaps of $53 million was

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized in earnings as interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt instruments. As a result of the termination of the
forward starting interest rate swaps, the Company recognized interest expense of $9 million, $6 million, and $1 million during the years ended September 25, 2009,
September 26, 2008, and September 28, 2007, respectively. Interest expense recognized during fiscal 2009 included $3 million of interest expense recognized as a result of the
Company's tender offer. See Note 11 for additional information regarding the tender offer.

Commodity Hedges

As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, the Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, all of which
are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production.

At
September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, the Company's commodity hedges, which related to purchases of gold, were in a gain position of $1 million and
$2 million, respectively, and had a notional value of $29 million and $21 million, respectively. The Company expects that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other
comprehensive income associated with the commodities hedges will be reclassified into the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations within the next twelve months as adjustments to cost of
sales.

Hedges of Net Investment

The Company hedges its net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany non-derivative financial instruments
denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $1,027 million and $1,161 million at September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008,
respectively. The Company reclassified foreign exchange losses of $72 million, $168 million, and $118 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These amounts were
recorded as currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses attributable to the translation of the net investment. See
Note 22 for additional information.

During fiscal 2009, the Company incurred losses of $178 million as a result of marking foreign currency derivatives not designated as
hedging instruments to fair value, particularly derivatives related to certain Eastern European currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2009. These losses were largely offset by the gains
realized as a result of re-measuring the underlying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to primarily the Euro or U.S. Dollar. These gains and losses were reflected in
selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations.

14. Retirement Plans

Adoption of Measurement Date Provisions and Funded Status Recognition Provisions of ASC 715

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions of ASC 715
(Compensation—Retirement Benefits), which require that plan assets and benefits obligations



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Retirement Plans (Continued)

be
measured as of fiscal year end. Prior to adoption of this provision, the Company's measurement date was August 31. The Company elected not to re-measure plan assets and benefit
obligations as of the first day of fiscal 2009. As a result, the impact of adoption in fiscal 2009 was an after-tax charge of $7 million, equal to approximately
one-twelfth of annual net periodic benefit costs on a pre-tax basis, to accumulated deficit, and an after-tax increase of $2 million in accumulated other
comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The
Company adopted the funded status recognition provisions of ASC 715 effective September 28, 2007. The impact of the adoption resulted in an after-tax decrease of
$225 million in accumulated other comprehensive income at September 28, 2007.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company has a number of contributory and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of its U.S. and
non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with local customs and practice. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation
and is charged to the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are
actuarially determined. The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

Prior
to Separation, the Company participated through Tyco International in one co-mingled plan that included plan participants of other Tyco International subsidiaries. The
Company recorded its portion of the co-mingled plan's expense and the related obligation, which has been actuarially determined based on the Company's specific benefit formulas by
participants and allocated plan assets. The contribution amounts were determined in total for the co-mingled plan and allocated to the Company based on headcount. Management believes such
allocations were reasonable. In fiscal 2007, this plan was legally separated, resulting in a reallocation of assets based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") prescribed
calculation.

The
net periodic benefit cost (credit) for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 was as follows:

During fiscal 2009, the funded status of the Company's pension plans deteriorated as a result of asset losses in its U.S. and non-U.S. plans
totaling $30 million and $60 million, respectively. As of September 25, 2009, the benefit obligations were also negatively impacted by a decrease in the discount rates, as
compared to September 26, 2008, used to present value the obligations. Weighted-average decreases of 120 basis points and 52 basis points for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans' discount rates
increased the obligations by $103 million and $113 million, respectively.

In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class
performance expectations as provided by its external advisors.

The
investment strategy for the U.S. pension plans has been governed by the Company's Investment Committee; investment strategies for non-U.S. pension plans are governed
locally. The Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a
prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. Projected returns are based primarily on pro forma asset allocation and expected
long-term returns and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.

During
fiscal 2008, the Company's Investment Committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. Plans' Master Trust from 60% equity and 40% fixed income to 30%
equity and 70% fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations. The target asset allocation transition began in fiscal 2008. As a result of
economic conditions during fiscal 2009, the Company has slowed the transition of the Master Trust asset allocation change. Asset reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based
on the funded status of the U.S. Plans' Master Trust.

Target
weighted-average asset allocations and weighted-average asset allocations for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans at fiscal year end 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

Tyco Electronics' common shares are not a direct investment of the Company's pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include Tyco
Electronics shares. The aggregate amount of the Tyco Electronics common shares would not be considered material relative to the total pension fund assets.

The
Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary
contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that, at a minimum, it will make the minimum required contributions to its pension plans in fiscal 2010 of
$3 million for U.S. plans and $80 million for non-U.S. plans.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include 401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and
nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants' compensation and was $55 million,
$66 million, and $61 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company maintains nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their
compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds
correspond to a number of funds in Tyco Electronics' 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Total deferred compensation liabilities were
$43 million and $38 million at fiscal year end 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Rabbi Trusts

The Company has established rabbi trusts, related to certain acquired companies, through which the assets may be used to pay
non-qualified plan benefits. The trusts primarily hold bonds and equities. The rabbi trust assets are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's
insolvency. The value of the assets held by these trusts, included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $76 million and $84 million at fiscal year end 2009 and 2008,
respectively. Total liabilities related to the assets held by the rabbi trust and reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $9 million and $14 million at fiscal year end 2009 and

Tyco Electronics Legal Proceedings

Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation

The Company is a party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions that may require the Company to pay damage awards. The
Company has assessed the status of these matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate.

Other Matters

The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions,
and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows.

Legal Matters under Separation and Distribution Agreement

The Separation and Distribution Agreement among the Company, Tyco International, and Covidien provided for the allocation among the
parties of Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to the Company's and Covidien's separations from Tyco International on June 29, 2007. Under
the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters at Separation related to the Company's business or assumed or
retained liabilities, and will indemnify the other parties for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Tyco Electronics remains responsible for 31% of certain
potential liabilities that may arise from litigation pending or threatened at Separation that was not allocated to one of the three parties, and Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for 27%
and 42%, respectively, of such liabilities. If any party defaults in payment of its allocated share of any such liability, each non-defaulting party will be responsible for an equal
portion of the amount in default together with any other non-defaulting party, although any such payments will not release the obligation of the defaulting party. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement,
Tyco International manages and controls all the legal matters related to the shared contingent liabilities, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. All costs and
expenses that Tyco International incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation, other than the amount of any judgment or settlement, which will be allocated in the manner described above,
will be borne equally by Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company.

Tyco International Legal Proceedings

Securities Class Actions and Settlement

As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, prior to the Separation, Tyco International and certain of its former
directors and officers were named as defendants in over 40 purported securities class action lawsuits. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities
related to the securities class actions were allocated among Tyco



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

International,
Covidien, and the Company. The Company is responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the resolution of the remaining pending litigation. Most of the securities
class actions were transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings. A consolidated securities class
action complaint was filed in these proceedings and on June 12, 2006, the court entered an order certifying a class "consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired
Tyco securities between December 13, 1999 and June 7, 2002, and who were damaged thereby, excluding defendants, all of the officers, directors and partners thereof, members of their
immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, and any entity in which any of the foregoing have or had a controlling interest." As previously reported, Tyco
International settled 32 of the purported securities class action lawsuits arising from the actions alleged to have been taken by its prior management, for which the Company was responsible for 31%.
All legal contingencies that could have affected the final order entered in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire approving the settlement expired on February 21,
2008. As of the opt-out deadline for the settlement, Tyco International received opt-out notices from individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by
class members. A number of these individuals and entities filed actions separately against Tyco International and/or Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company, all of which have been settled
subsequently as discussed below. In addition, several cases asserting claims arising under ERISA were filed, all of which have been settled subsequently as discussed below.

In
fiscal 2007, the Company was allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million for the class action settlement, for which no tax benefit was available. In addition, in
fiscal 2007, the Company was allocated $35 million of income relating to Tyco International's expected recovery of certain costs from insurers. The net charge of $887 million was
recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as pre-Separation litigation charges, net. The portion allocated to the Company was consistent with the sharing percentage
included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Tyco International placed funds in escrow for the benefit of the class. The escrow account earned interest that was payable to the class. In
addition, interest was accrued on the class action settlement liability.

The
finalization of the class action settlement in February 2008 resulted in the extinguishment of the Company's class action settlement liability of $3,020 million, interest in
the escrow of $936 million, and class action settlement receivable of $2,084 million from the Consolidated Balance Sheet in fiscal 2008. The finalization of the settlement resulted in a
decrease to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2008. It did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
because the Company had previously fully funded its portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability, as mentioned above.

Settlement of Securities Proceedings Not Covered by the Class Action Settlement

In fiscal 2008, Tyco International settled securities litigation captioned

New Jersey v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al.

and

Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

for $73 million and
$36 million, respectively. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company recorded charges of $34 million, for which no tax benefit was
available, in fiscal 2008. In addition, the Company recorded income of $12 million in fiscal 2008 related to Tyco International's recovery of certain costs from insurers.

Hess v. Tyco

and

Sciallo v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

and an opt-out case brought
by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company recorded charges of
$9 million, for which no tax benefit was available.

During
the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company settled opt-out cases with Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC and related plaintiffs
and the Public Employees' Retirement Association of Colorado. Pursuant to the sharing formula, the Company recorded charges of $19 million, for which no tax benefit was available. Additionally,
the Company recorded reserves totaling $375 million representing the best estimate of probable loss for the remaining securities litigation claims subject to the Separation and Distribution
Agreement, including remaining opt-out cases and cases arising under ERISA. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 of
$116 million for its share of the reserves. Upon final settlement of the ERISA cases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a $25 million tax benefit. There were no
tax benefits attributable for the other cases.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2009, Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company settled five of the remaining opt-out cases for $199 million. Pursuant to the
sharing formula, the Company's share of the settlement amounts was $62 million. As the Company had previously established reserves for these opt-out cases during the second quarter
of fiscal 2009, the settlements did not impact its Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company settled for a total of $70 million eight consolidated class actions brought under ERISA
against Tyco International and certain of its current and former employees, officers and directors. Pursuant to the sharing formula, the Company's share of the settlement amount was
$22 million. Also, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company agreed to settle the remaining opt-out case for $2 million.
Pursuant to the sharing formula, the Company's share of the settlement amount was $1 million. As the Company had previously established reserves for these consolidated actions and this
opt-out case during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the settlements did not impact its Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. Only three of the securities cases remain
outstanding.

Investigations

As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, Tyco International and others received various subpoenas and requests from
the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Division of Enforcement, the U.S. Department of Labor, the General Services Administration, and others seeking the production of documents in
connection with various investigations into Tyco International's governance, management, operations, accounting, and related controls prior to the Separation. The Department of Labor is investigating
Tyco International and the administrators of certain of its benefit plans. Tyco International has advised the Company that it cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can it
predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that Tyco International will be required to pay material fines or suffer other penalties, and pursuant to the liability sharing
provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, a portion of such payments



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

may
be allocated to the Company. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. As a result, the
Company's share of such potential losses also is not estimable and may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, Tyco International received and has responded to various allegations that
certain improper payments were made by Tyco International subsidiaries, including Tyco Electronics subsidiaries, in recent years prior to the Separation. Tyco International reported to the U.S.
Department of Justice and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations, including that it retained outside counsel to perform a
company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls, and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), and that it would continue to investigate
and make periodic progress reports to these agencies. To date, the Company's baseline review has revealed that some of the Company's former business practices may not comply with FCPA requirements. At
this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters and other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential
loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of these matters. However, it is possible that the Company may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties, or incur
settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Any judgment, settlement, or other cost incurred by Tyco
International in connection with these matters not specifically allocated to Tyco International, Covidien, or the Company would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement.

Income Taxes

In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidien's, Tyco
Electronics', and Tyco International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any,
incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes
within the meaning of Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for
tax-favored treatment under the Code.

Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, the Company entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco
International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain
contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify the Company for 69% of certain
liabilities settled in cash by the Company with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, the Company has made similar indemnifications to Tyco
International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. If any of the companies
responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

were
to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, the Company would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation.

Prior
to Separation, certain of the Company's subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of the Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are
periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax
adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to
these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to Tyco
Electronics entities have been recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In addition, the Company may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco International's tax
obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. See Note 12 for additional information.

In
prior years, in connection with the IRS audit of various fiscal years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax
returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. The IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the IRS had completed its
field work. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2005 is probable and, accordingly,
has recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Tyco
International continues to complete proposed adjustments to the remainder of its U.S. federal income tax returns. In fiscal 2009, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income
tax returns were completed by Tyco International and in connection with these adjustments, the Company recorded a $97 million increase in income tax liabilities, a $10 million increase
in deferred tax assets, a $60 million increase in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, and a $27 million charge to
contributed surplus. In fiscal 2008, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and presented to the IRS. As a result, in fiscal 2008, the
Company recorded a $225 million decrease in income tax liabilities, a $42 million decrease in deferred tax assets, a $140 million decrease in the receivable from Tyco
International and Covidien in connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, a $57 million increase in the indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien, and a $14 million
charge to contributed surplus. See Note 12 for additional information regarding the indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien.

In
fiscal 2008, Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company completed and filed certain fiscal 2007 U.S. consolidated federal and state income tax returns which included a combination
of Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company's subsidiaries. As a result, the Company recorded a $66 million decrease in income tax liabilities with a corresponding offset to the income tax
receivable, a $44 million decrease in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien and a $42 million decrease in the payable to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax
Sharing Agreement, a $30 million increase in contributed surplus, and a $32 million net adjustment to other related tax accounts.

As
the Company's tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to Separation, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a
material impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Additionally, adjustments may be recorded to shareholders' equity in the future for the impact of filing final or
amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and/or the Company's subsidiaries for the periods prior to the
Separation.

During
fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued anticipated
Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. Tyco International has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling
$498 million, with an estimated cash impact of $458 million which was paid by Tyco International during fiscal 2007. The Company's portion of this payment was $163 million. It is
the Company's understanding that Tyco International has appealed other proposed adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and is vigorously defending its prior filed tax return positions.
Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and
1999. Any penalty imposed would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. It is the Company's understanding that Tyco International is vigorously
opposing the assertion of any such penalties.

It
is the Company's understanding that Tyco International has made progress during fiscal 2009 towards resolving several of the disputed tax issues for the years 1997 through 2000 and it
could reach agreement with the IRS on these matters within the next twelve months. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Tyco International settled a matter with the IRS concerning certain tax
deductions claimed on Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004. As a result of this settlement, the Company recorded a $28 million income tax charge in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions. The IRS continues to audit certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004.

The
Company continues to believe that the amounts recorded in its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the
ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Environmental Matters

The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of
sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and
alternative cleanup methods. As of fiscal year end 2009, the Company concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $13 million to
$26 million. As of fiscal year end 2009, the Company concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $16 million, of which $5 million is included in accrued
and other current liabilities and $11 million is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental
matters of $16 million, the Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or
cash flows.

Matters Related to the Company's Former Wireless Systems Business

Certain liabilities and contingencies related to the Company's former Wireless Systems business were retained by the Company when this
business was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. These include certain retained liabilities related to the State of New York contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the
acquisition of Com-Net by the Wireless Systems business in 2001. See additional information below. Also, see Note 5 for additional information regarding the divestiture of the
Wireless Systems business.

State of New York Contract

On September 19, 2005, the Company was awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State of New York to construct,
operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. On August 29, 2008, the Company was served by the State with a default notice
related to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, the Company had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the State. On
October 16, 2008, the Company informed the State that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified
the system ready for testing. The State conducted further testing during November and December 2008. On January 15, 2009, the State notified the Company that, in the State's opinion, the
Company had not fully remediated the issues cited by the State and it had determined that the Company was in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The
State contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State in conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, on
January 16, 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by the Company. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional
$50 million against the standby letter of credit, although the Company disputes that the State has any basis to do so.

On
February 13, 2009, the Company filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including
breach of contract, unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State
terminated the contract "for convenience." On September 25, 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract
claims. On November 16, 2009, the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim. The counterclaim asserts a claim for breach of contract and alleges that the State has incurred
damages in excess of $275 million. The Company believes that the counterclaim is without merit and intends to vigorously pursue its claims in this matter. The parties are now proceeding with
discovery.

As
a result of these actions, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded pre-tax charges totaling $111 million associated with this contract. These
charges are reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as a result of the Company's sale of the Wireless Systems business. See
Note 5 for further discussion of discontinued operations and the sale of the Wireless Systems business. The charges included an impairment charge of $61 million to write-off
all costs incurred in constructing the network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the State against the standby letter of credit of $50 million. The assets related to the
impairment charge were previously reflected primarily as inventory on the

Balance Sheet. The Company has not recognized any revenue related to the lease contract.

Com-Net

At September 25, 2009, the Company had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to its fiscal 2001
acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system
for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company
does not believe it has any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested the Company's position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania, which is in the motion pleading and discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements as the Company does not
believe that any payment is probable or estimable at this time.

16. Fair Value Measurements

The Company adopted ASC 820 (Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures) on September 27, 2008. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company will adopt the provisions of
ASC 820 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities in fiscal 2010; adoption will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

ASC
820 specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of the inputs utilized in the valuation. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from
independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with ASC 820, fair value measurements are classified under the following
hierarchy:

•

Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

•

Level 2—Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

•

Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flows methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

The
adoption of the fair value provisions of ASC 820 had no effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

The
Company does not have significant financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective assets and liabilities measured at fair value:

•

Commodity swap contracts—Fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using quoted futures
exchanges (level 1).

•

Foreign currency contracts—Fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined based on observable market
transactions of spot currency rates and forward rates (level 2).

•

Rabbi trust assets—Rabbi trust assets are comprised of marketable debt and equity securities that are marked
to fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (level 1).

The
majority of derivatives entered into by the Company are valued using the over-the-counter quoted market prices for similar instruments. The Company does not
believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity.

17. Related Party Transactions

Trade Activity

Prior to Separation, the Company sold certain of its manufactured products consisting primarily of connectors and cable assemblies to
Tyco International and its affiliates, at prices which approximated fair value. Sales to Tyco International and its affiliates, which are included in net sales on the Consolidated and Combined
Statements of Operations, were $60 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2007.

Debt Related Allocations

The Company was allocated a portion of Tyco International's net interest expense and loss on retirement of debt in fiscal 2007. See
Note 11 for further information regarding these allocations.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

17. Related Party Transactions (Continued)

Allocated Expenses

In fiscal 2007, the Company was allocated a net charge from Tyco International of $887 million related to the class action
settlement. See Note 15 for further information regarding the class action settlement.

Prior
to Separation, the Company was allocated general corporate overhead expenses from Tyco International for corporate-related functions based on a pro-rata percentage of
Tyco International's consolidated net revenue. General corporate overhead expenses primarily related to centralized corporate functions, including treasury, tax, legal, internal audit, human
resources, and risk management functions. During fiscal 2007, the Company was allocated $152 million of general corporate overhead expenses incurred by Tyco International, which are included
within selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations.

As
discussed in Note 1, the Company believes the assumptions and methodologies underlying the allocation of general corporate overhead expenses and net class action settlement
costs from Tyco International were reasonable. However, such expenses may not be indicative of the actual level of expenses that would have been incurred by the Company had it been operating as an
independent, publicly-traded company during the period prior to Separation.

Transactions with Tyco Electronics' and Tyco International's Directors

During fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies
where Tyco Electronics' directors were employed and served as officers. Purchases from and sales to such companies were not material during each of these periods. In addition, during the period prior
to the Separation in fiscal 2007, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where Tyco International's directors were employed and served as
officers. Tyco Electronics' purchases from and sales to such companies were not material in pre-Separation fiscal 2007.

18. Income Taxes

The Company's operations are conducted through its various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. The Company has provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws
and rates in the countries in which its operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation. In fiscal 2009, the Company changed its place of incorporation from Bermuda
to Switzerland. The Company does not expect the change to materially impact its tax provision or cash tax burden.

The tax provision for fiscal 2009 was impacted by the $3,547 million pre-tax impairment of goodwill for which a partial tax
benefit of $523 million was recorded, a $28 million charge related to the settlement of a tax matter (see Note 15 for additional information), a $144 million
pre-tax charge related to pre-Separation securities litigation for which a partial tax benefit of $25 million was recorded, and a $24 million detriment related to
a $68 million pre-tax expense recognized pursuant to the Company's Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. See Notes 15 and 19 for additional information
regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. Additionally, the fiscal 2009 tax provision included adjustments related to prior years tax returns, including a $49 million tax benefit, as discussed
below. The $49 million tax benefit is reflected in change in accrued income tax liabilities in fiscal 2009 in the reconciliation above.

During
fiscal 2009, in connection with the IRS examination of the Company's 2001 through 2004 U.S. federal income tax returns, certain favorable adjustments were identified and presented
to the IRS. These adjustments resulted in a net $49 million tax benefit included in the tax provision, a $42 million increase to deferred tax assets, and a $7 million reduction of
income tax liabilities. The Company concluded these items were not material to current or prior years financial statements and, accordingly, recorded them during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

18. Income Taxes (Continued)

The
provision for fiscal 2008 includes a benefit of $198 million primarily related to the pre-tax income of $545 million recognized in connection with the
adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, for which no tax was provided. The provision was also impacted by increased accruals in fiscal 2008 of interest related to uncertain tax
positions partially
offset by a $42 million benefit associated with a favorable settlement with a taxing authority for certain pre-Separation tax issues. In addition, the provision for fiscal 2008
reflects the benefits of increased profitability in operations in lower tax rate jurisdictions, a $33 million benefit related to adjustments to tax account balances, a $25 million
increase in the valuation allowance related to restructuring charges, and a $22 million tax detriment recorded in connection with the goodwill impairment charge for which a tax benefit was not
fully realized.

During
fiscal 2008, the Company, in connection with the implementation of certain new control processes, completed the analysis and reconciliation of its tax accounts. As a result of
this analysis, the Company adjusted its tax account balances and recorded a $34 million reduction in income tax liabilities, a $1 million increase in deferred tax liabilities, and a
$33 million benefit in the income tax provision.

In
fiscal 2007, no tax benefits were recorded related to the pre-tax charges for the class action settlement and loss on retirement of debt. The net increase of
$26 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in fiscal 2007 reflects the tax impacts of increased borrowings as a result of the class action settlement and the Company's Separation
from Tyco International.

During
fiscal 2009, tax loss and credit carryforwards increased primarily due to tax losses of $1,550 million (tax effected) generated in connection with the
write-down of investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was increased by a corresponding amount due to the uncertainty of the future realization of
these tax losses.

At
fiscal year end 2009, the Company had approximately $1,447 million of U.S. federal and $181 million of U.S state net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) which
will expire in future years through 2029. In addition, at fiscal year end 2009, the Company had approximately $149 million of U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, of which $29 million
have no expiration and $120 million will expire in future years through 2029, and $31 million of U.S. state tax credits carryforwards which will expire in future years through 2024. The
Company also had $84 million of U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards (tax effected) expiring through 2014 at fiscal year end 2009.

At
fiscal year end 2009, the Company had approximately $2,228 million of net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of which
$1,728 million have no expiration and $500 million will expire in future years through 2023. Also, at fiscal year end 2009, there were $4 million of non-U.S. tax
credit carryforwards which will expire in future years through 2023 and $7 million of non-U.S. capital loss carryforwards (tax effected) with no expiration.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

18. Income Taxes (Continued)

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $2,487 million and $873 million at fiscal year end 2009 and 2008, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of
the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future
taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions
of ASC 740 which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. At fiscal year end
2009, approximately $40 million of the valuation allowance relates to share-based compensation and will be recorded to equity if certain net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are
utilized.

The
calculation of the Company's tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where the Company
conducts its operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, the Company recognizes liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax
jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact
of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the
tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that
differs from the Company's current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the
adequacy of these recorded amounts. If the Company's current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If
the Company's current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. Substantially all of these tax liabilities and related
interest are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as payment is not expected within one year.

The
Company has provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed
in fiscal 2010. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for
temporary
differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the
Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 25, 2009, certain subsidiaries had approximately
$14 billion of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if the Company's intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change
and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested
earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.

Uncertain Tax Position Provisions of ASC 740

Effective September 29, 2007, the beginning of fiscal 2008, the Company adopted the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC
740. In connection with the adoption, the Company recorded a net increase in contingent tax liabilities of $1,197 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $648 million, and a
corresponding decrease in the opening balance of accumulated earnings of $549 million. Furthermore,



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

18. Income Taxes (Continued)

pursuant
to the Tax Sharing Agreement, certain contingent tax liabilities related to unresolved tax matters are subject to sharing between Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company. See
Note 15 for additional information regarding responsibilities for unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. Tyco International and Covidien are contractually obligated for
$531 million of the Company's net increase in contingent tax liabilities recorded in connection with its adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740. Accordingly, the Company
recorded this amount in 2008 as other income and recorded the related increase in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien for shared contingent tax liabilities. In addition, in connection
with the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, the Company reassessed and decreased its guarantee liabilities pursuant to ASC 460 liability to Tyco International and Covidien
and recorded $14 million of other income. See Note 12 for additional information regarding the Company's indemnifications under the Tax Sharing Agreement. These adjustments are

The Company records accrued interest as well as penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. As of September 25, 2009, the Company had
recorded $1,215 million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of which $1,214 million was recorded in income taxes and
$1 million was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized $82 million and $115 million, respectively, of interest and
penalties on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. As of September 26, 2008, the balance of accrued interest and penalties was $1,110 million of which
$1,106 million was recorded in income taxes and $4 million was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities.

In
fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000. Tyco International is in the
process of appealing certain tax adjustments proposed by the IRS related to this period. In fiscal 2008, the IRS commenced its field examination of certain Tyco International U.S. federal income tax
returns for the years 2001 through 2004. Tyco International's U.S. federal tax filings for years subsequent to 2004 also remain open to examination by the IRS. See Note 15 for additional
information regarding the status of IRS examinations.

The
Company files income tax returns on a combined, unitary, or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3

utilized in a subsequent period.

Although
it is difficult to predict the timing or results of certain pending examinations, it is the Company's understanding that Tyco International has made progress during fiscal 2009
towards resolving with the IRS certain disputed tax adjustments related to Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000. Accordingly, Tyco International and the
IRS could reach agreement on these matters within the next twelve months. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and it is not possible to estimate the impact of an agreement with respect to
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 25, 2009.

The
Company is not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

In
fiscal 2008, the Company recorded other income of $567 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien, of which $545 million ($1.13
for basic earnings per share and $1.12 for diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2008) related to certain incremental tax liabilities recorded by the Company in connection with the adoption of the
uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740.

Net
other expense of $219 million in fiscal 2007 includes an allocation from Tyco International of $232 million for loss on retirement of debt. See Note 11 for
additional information. Additionally, in fiscal 2007, the Company recorded other income of $13 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien.

20. Earnings (Loss) Per Share

The computation of basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the Company's net income (loss) divided by the basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The computation
of diluted earnings (loss) per share is based on the Company's net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for potentially dilutive unexercised share
options and non-vested restricted share awards. The following table sets forth the denominators of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share computations:

For
fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, certain share options were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the underlying exercise prices were greater than
the average market prices of Tyco Electronics' common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive. Such shares not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share totaled
20 million, 21 million, and 20 million as of September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008, and September 28, 2007, respectively.

For
fiscal 2009 and 2007, non-vested restricted share awards and options to purchase Tyco Electronics' common shares with the underlying exercise prices less than the average
market prices were outstanding, but were excluded from the calculations of diluted loss per share as inclusion of these securities would have been antidilutive. Such shares not included in the
computation of diluted loss per share totaled 1 million and 3 million as of September 25, 2009 and September 28, 2007, respectively.

21. Equity

Change of Domicile

Effective June 25, 2009, the Company changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. In connection with
the Change of Domicile and in accordance with the laws of Switzerland, the par value of the Company's common shares increased from $0.20 per share to 2.60 Swiss Francs ("CHF") per share (or $2.40
based on an exchange rate in effect on June 22, 2009). The Change of Domicile was approved at a special meeting of shareholders held on June 22, 2009. The following steps occurred in
connection with the Change of Domicile, which did not result in a change to total Shareholders' Equity:

1)

the
par value of common shares was increased from $0.20 to CHF 2.60 through a 1-for-12 reverse share split, followed by the
issuance of 11 fully paid bonus shares so that the same number of shares were outstanding before and after the Change of Domicile but with an increased par value per share, which reduced contributed
surplus by $1.1 billion with a corresponding increase to common shares;

2)

the
cancellation of approximately 32 million shares held in treasury;

3)

the
elimination of share premium with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus, all of which was designated as freely distributable reserves for Swiss
corporate law purposes; and

4)

the
elimination of 125 million authorized preferred shares, none of which were issued and outstanding.

Preferred Shares

In connection with the Change of Domicile, as discussed above, all authorized preferred shares were eliminated. At September 26,
2008, the Company had authorized 125,000,000 preferred shares, par value of $0.20, none of which were issued and outstanding.

Common Shares

As a result of the adoption of the Company's new articles of association in connection with the Change of Domicile but prior to the
distribution to shareholders discussed under "Distributions to Shareholders" below, the Company's ordinary share capital was $1,124 million with 468 million registered common shares and
a par value of CHF 2.60 (or $2.40 based on an exchange rate in effect on June 22, 2009). Subject to certain conditions specified in the articles of association, the shareholders have
authorized the Company's board of directors to increase the Company's share capital (the value, in CHF, of authorized shares multiplied by the par value), by issuing up to 234 million
conditional shares and up to 234 million authorized shares (until June 22, 2011). Although the Company states its par value in Swiss Francs, it continues to use the U.S. Dollar as its
reporting currency for preparing its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Common Shares Held in Treasury

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company transferred 10 million common shares held in treasury to a subsidiary.
Shares held by the subsidiary continue to be presented as treasury shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

21. Equity (Continued)

Prior
to the Change of Domicile, approximately 32 million shares held by the Company in treasury were cancelled, leaving 10 million shares held in treasury as of
June 26, 2009. At September 26, 2008, there were 37 million shares held in treasury.

Share Premium and Contributed Surplus

As of September 26, 2008, the Company was incorporated under the laws of Bermuda. Prior to the Change of Domicile, in accordance
with the Bermuda Companies Act, when the Company issued shares for cash at a premium to their par value, the resulting premium was an increase to a share premium account, a
non-distributable reserve. Contributed surplus, subject to certain conditions, is a distributable reserve.

Distributions to Shareholders

Under current Swiss law, distributions to shareholders made in the form of a reduction of registered share capital are exempt from
Swiss withholding tax. Beginning on January 1, 2011, subject to the adoption of implementing regulations and amendments to Swiss tax law, distributions to shareholders made out of contributed
surplus will be exempt from Swiss withholding tax. Distributions or dividends on the Company's shares must be approved by the Company's shareholders.

On
June 22, 2009, the Company's shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of the Company's common shares of
CHF 0.17 per share. During the quarter ended September 25, 2009, the distribution was paid in U.S. Dollars at a rate of $0.16 per share. This capital reduction reduced the par value of
the Company's common shares from CHF 2.60 (equivalent to $2.40) to CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24).

Upon
approval by the shareholders of the cash distribution in the form of a capital reduction, the Company records a liability with a corresponding charge to common shares. There were no
unpaid dividends and distributions to shareholders as of September 25, 2009. Dividends declared but not paid were recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at September 26, 2008.

Share Repurchase Program

During fiscal 2009, the Company purchased approximately 6 million of its common shares for $125 million under its share
repurchase program. Also, during fiscal 2009, the Company settled purchases of $27 million of its common shares which occurred prior to the end of fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, the Company
repurchased approximately 37 million common shares for $1,269 million under this program, of which $1,242 million was paid as of September 26, 2008. No common shares were
repurchased under this program in fiscal 2007. Since inception of the share repurchase program, which has a current authorization of $2,000 million, the Company has purchased approximately
43 million shares for $1,394 million.

Parent Company Investment and Separation Related Equity Adjustments

For the period prior to June 29, 2007, Tyco International's investment in the electronics businesses is shown as parent company
investment on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Parent company investment represents the historical investment of capital into the Company, the

to the Company of various expenses incurred by Tyco International.

On
June 29, 2007, Tyco International completed a distribution of one common share of Tyco Electronics Ltd. for every four common shares of Tyco International. Following the
Separation, the Company had 497 million common shares outstanding. After the Separation adjustments were recorded on June 29, 2007, the remaining parent company investment balance, which
includes all earnings prior to the Separation, was transferred to contributed surplus. Net income subsequent to the Separation is included in accumulated earnings.

During
fiscal 2007, the Company assumed $1,091 million of contingent tax liabilities from Tyco International and recorded a related receivable of $844 million from Tyco
International and Covidien to reflect the 69% indemnification granted by each. These items were recorded as adjustments to contributed surplus on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Certain adjustments were made to those amounts assumed on Separation in periods subsequent to fiscal 2007.

23. Share Plans

All equity awards (restricted share awards and share options) granted by the Company subsequent to Separation were granted under the Tyco Electronics Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive
Plan, as amended and restated (the "2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan is administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Tyco Electronics, which consists
exclusively of independent directors of Tyco Electronics and provides for the award of share options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long-term performance awards,
restricted units, deferred stock units, restricted shares, promissory shares, and other share-based awards (collectively, "Awards"). The 2007 Plan provides for a maximum of 25 million common
shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan
allows for the use of authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to be used to satisfy such awards. As of September 25, 2009, the Company had 10 million shares available under the
2007 Plan.

Prior
to the Separation on June 29, 2007, all equity awards held by Company employees were granted by Tyco International under the Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and
Incentive Plan or other Tyco International equity incentive plans. Based on the grant date, type of award, and employing company, awards converted from Tyco International to Tyco Electronics awards in
different manners. As a result of the conversion, all Tyco Electronics restricted share awards granted to employees of Tyco International and Covidien are fully vested. Approximately 4 million
vested options to purchase common shares of the Company are held by current or former employees of Tyco International and Covidien. All share option award conversions were done in accordance with
Sections 409A and 424 of the Code.

Restricted Share Awards

Restricted share awards are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under
the 2007 Plan. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement or normal retirement requirements, all or a portion of the award
may lapse, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, whereas recipients of restricted
units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents. For grants that vest based on certain specified performance criteria, the fair market value of the shares or units is expensed over the
period of performance, once achievement of criteria is deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to
expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest
in increments over a period of four years as determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee, or upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed targeted
levels, if applicable. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated forfeitures.

respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of Tyco International restricted share awards granted to Tyco Electronics employees during pre-Separation fiscal 2007
was $30.34.

As
of fiscal year end 2009, there was $57 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested Tyco Electronics restricted share awards. That cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.

Deferred Stock Units

Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") are notional units that are tied to the value of Tyco Electronics common shares with distribution
deferred until termination of employment. Distribution, when made, will be in the form of actual shares. Similar to restricted share grants that vest through the passage of time, the fair value of
DSUs is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the vesting period. Recipients of DSUs do not have the right to vote such shares
and do not have the right to receive cash dividends. However, they have the right to receive dividend equivalents, which are delivered at the same time as the underlying DSUs. Conditions of vesting
are determined at the time of grant. As of fiscal year end 2009 and 2008, 111,138 and 53,295 vested but undistributed DSUs were outstanding, respectively. The grant-date fair value of
vested but undistributed DSU grants was expensed immediately, is included in the total share-based compensation cost referred to below, and was not significant during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, and
post-Separation fiscal 2007. There were no DSUs issued prior to Separation.

Share Options

Share options are granted to purchase Tyco Electronics common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of
the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2007 Plan. Options generally vest and become exercisable in equal annual
installments over a period of four years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant.

The
conversion of Tyco International share option awards into Tyco Electronics share option awards at Separation was considered a modification of an award in accordance with ASC 718. As
a result, the Company compared the fair value of the award immediately prior to the Separation to the fair value immediately after the Separation to measure incremental compensation cost. The
conversion resulted in an increase in the fair value of the awards of $13 million. Of that amount, the Company recorded non-cash compensation expense of $1 million,
$1 million, and $11 million in selling, general, and administrative and separation costs on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007,
respectively.

As
of fiscal year end 2009, there was $29 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested Tyco Electronics share options granted under Tyco
Electronics share option plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation cost during fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 totaled $53 million, $62 million, and
$100 million, respectively, of which $51 million, $56 million, and $89 million, respectively, have been included on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations
within selling, general, and administrative expenses and separation costs. Share-based compensation expense of $2 million, $6 million, and $11 million has been included on the
Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The Company has recognized a related tax
benefit associated with its share-based compensation arrangements of $13 million, $17 million, and $27 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

The
grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with
respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the stock of a composite of peers of Tyco



TYCO ELECTRONICS LTD.

Electronics
and implied volatility derived from exchange traded options on that same composite of peers. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee
exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which
approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on Tyco Electronics' expected dividend rate. The compensation expense recognized is net of
estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

The Company also maintains employee stock purchase plans for the benefit of employees of certain qualified U.S. and
non-U.S. subsidiaries. The terms of these plans provide employees the right to purchase shares of the Company's stock at a stated price and receive certain tax benefits. The significant
plans are discussed below.

Substantially
all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries are eligible to participate in
the Tyco Electronics Ltd. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESP Plan"). Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the purchase of shares. The Company matches a portion of
the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction on the first $40,000 of payroll deductions. All common shares purchased under the ESP Plan are purchased
from a subsidiary of the Company. Participation in the ESP Plan began in December 2007. The Company incurred $1 million in matching contribution expense in both fiscal 2009 and 2008.

Substantially
all full-time employees of the Company's United Kingdom subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the Tyco Electronics Ltd. Savings Related Share Plan
(the "UK SAYE Plan"). Under the UK SAYE Plan, eligible employees are granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of grant. Options
under the UK SAYE Plan are generally exercisable after a period of three years and expire six months after the date of vesting. Participation in the UK SAYE Plan began in February 2008. As of fiscal
year end 2009 and 2008, 206,614 and 123,818 non-vested options are outstanding under the UK SAYE Plan, respectively; there are no vested options outstanding. Non-cash
compensation expense related to the UK SAYE Plan, which is included in the total share-based compensation cost referred to above, was not significant in fiscal 2009 and 2008.

24. Segment and Geographic Data

The Company operates through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Undersea Telecommunications. See Note 1 for a description
of the segments in which the Company operates. The Company aggregates its operating segments into reportable segments based upon the Company's internal business structure. Segment information has been
revised to reflect the Company's current segment reporting structure. Prior period segment results have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

The
Company sold its Wireless Systems business in May 2009. This business has been reclassified as discontinued operations on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. See
Note 5 for additional information regarding discontinued operations and the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued operations,
this business was reported as the Company's former Wireless Systems segment.

Effective
January 1, 2009, the Company established the Specialty Products Group from its existing businesses. The results of this new organization are reported as a separate
reporting segment on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. This new segment is comprised of the Aerospace, Defense, and Marine; Touch Systems; Medical; and Circuit Protection businesses
which were formerly reported in the Electronic Components segment.

Segment
performance is evaluated based on net sales and operating income. Generally, the Company considers all expenses to be of an operating nature, and, accordingly, allocates them to
each

segment. Costs specific to a segment are charged to the segment. Corporate expenses, such as headquarters administrative costs, are allocated to the segments based on segment operating
income. Pre-Separation litigation charges and separation costs were not allocated to the
segments. Intersegment sales are not material and are recorded at selling prices that approximate market prices. Corporate assets are allocated to the segments based on segment assets.

CHF 0.17 per share for each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. This capital reduction will reduce the par value of the Company's common shares from CHF 2.43 (equivalent to
$2.24) to CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92). The distribution will be paid in U.S. Dollars at a rate of $0.16 per share for each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010.
